# SPAM TWEET ANALYSIS

**We have a few set of normal tweets and few spam tweets. We will find the spam tweet and plot it on graph with colour code to show how the SPAM tweets are different then Normal ones.**

**Normal Tweets:**

All the normal and spam tweet are preprocessed using the usual procedure as mentioned in question 1 above.

**Levenshtein Distance:** It is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.

The Levenshtein distance is calculated between normal and spam tweets and the result is shown below.
