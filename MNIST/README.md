# Fashion MNIST

### AIM:
**Zalando, a fashion and technology company released MNIST Fashion, an alternative to the famous MNIST hand written digit classification dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images of fashion items of 10 different kinds: (0) T-shirt/top, (1) Trouser, (2) Pullover, (3) Dress, (4) Coat, (5) Sandal, (6) Shirt, (7) Sneaker, (8) Bag, and 9) Ankle boot. The task associated with this is to build a classification model that can recognise these different fashion items.**
