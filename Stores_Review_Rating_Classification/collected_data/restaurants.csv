"My husband and I had a rare afternoon off so we decided to try this place. I had been here once before with my friend for drinks after work and enjoyed. We sat down and the waitress gave us the entire menu, no explanation or indication that the whole menu was not available. We were going to order some food (late lunch, about 2:30) and the waitress came back and said the kitchen was closed. Okay, no big deal, we'll have some wine and find a place to eat in the area afterward. The first page on the menu was their Happy Hour deals. The menu very clearly states Happy Hour, Monday through Friday until 7:50. Cute. The wines were $7.50 per glass. My husband and I both pointed to wines on the front cover of the menu (the ""Happy Hour"" menu). When I got the bill, we were charged full price for the wines. I asked the waitress and she said ""Oh, happy hour doesn't start until 4:00."" Yet NO WHERE on the menu does it say that. In fact, the menu does not indicate any start time, only an end time. Not only that, but the waitress could clearly see that we were ordering from the Happy Hour menu (we did the dumb pointing at names thing). She should have mentioned at that time that the wines would be full price. Instead, she kind of laughed it off and said we probably should put 4:00 on there and I said you absolutely should. I will not be returning or recommending.",negative
"For years I thought this was only a wine store until my sister stopped in and told me I had to go. This is a nice little place. I have stopped in now twice, once on a Saturday afternoon and once on a Tuesday evening. Both times there were others there but nothing too crowded. I like that you can chose wine by the bottle, glass, flight or beer (bottled and draft). The food is tasty too. I have enjoyed their artichoke Asiago dip, stuffed peppadews (medium heat), and buffalo chicken flatbread. This is a nice relaxed place to hang out with friends with a glass of wine (or beer) and have a tasty snack.",positive
"This place is so charming! I went with my husband and we both loved the simple clean decor and romantic lighting. The wine and food were both delicious. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. I also found it to be very affordable, with a range of wine prices and the option to enjoy some affordable appetizers if you don't want to spend money on a full meal. We will be back!",positive
"We have been wanting to try this place for a couple of years now. Finally stopped in last night. The service was excellent and the food was great. It is very cute inside with a romantic flair. They also have a little wine shop right next to the restaurant. I can't wait to go back when it's snowing outside, I think it will be beautiful.",positive
"Decor looks ok but layout is too busy. Difficult to walk, sit/talk, breathe. Food is...edible? Service is mostly underwhelming. I think for this price I would visit Creekside, Courtyard, or Burntwood instead next time.",negative
"l love this place! Great wine and delicious light fare. The service could be a little more attentive. There is a nice mix of crowd that changes throughout the night. But beware, the seats on the chairs at the bar are VERY slippery even before the wine!",positive
Overpriced. Food wasn't that great either. What bugged me the most is my wife and I were sitting at the end of the bar where apparently the servers like to congregate when they have nothing to do. The guy sitting next to us was an off duty server and had his laptop and everyone kept coming over and hanging out with him. It's just off-putting to have to sit next to a bunch of servers BSing instead of working. Couldn't even hear our own conversation.,negative
"Cute place. Decent selection of wine. Sadly it ends there. There is a $7.50 uncorking fee if you purchase a bottle & choose to drink it there. They tell you they will seal it up for you. Unfortunately the server put the cork from my $55 wine into a bottle of $16 wine, put in a paper bag & stapled it shut around the cork. He said this was fine & would not be considered an open container??? I wish I would have opened the bag. Called the manager when I got home. Not the nicest of guys. He's sorry, will talk to the waiter, & if I come back & mention his name he will ""send something my way"". Since they did not seal up the bottle & gave me the wrong bottle he should be crediting my card back!",negative
"Such a cute and intimate space for some delicious wine! Came here to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. They had a decent selection of wine by the glass. It was nice to see that they weren't all the traditional names. I was able to try some new wine and who doesn't love that? They definitely have a better selection of red wine. But I don't discriminate against red or white so I was happy with each. We both enjoyed some tasty flatbread. Delicious! They even had a mini summer menu selection! For dessert we had a chocolate fondue plate. We both agreed that the pound cake was the best! We would have had the whole plate be pound cake if we could have. I would have given 5 stars but the service was a bit spotty. Few times we would have an empty glass of wine, but our server Brody was very friendly which keeps it at a 4. We will definitely be back for more vino, flat bread and of course the pound cake! Cheers!",positive
Some people believe you cannot fall in love just by looks but I sure did with this place. The ambiance here is great and the place is clean and crisp. I visited on a Wednesday night and it was very empty but that didn't stop my friend and I from having a great time. We never felt rushed to order or rushed to leave. They did not try to close early because the place was empty (this has happened to me at other places). My friend and I sat a table by the window and were able to chat for hours while drinking wine and enjoying great food! This place makes a good date night spot or a place to get together with a group of friends! I started with a glass of the house sangria and it was not my favorite but is by no means bad. From there I asked the waiter to help me pick out a wine that was on the drier side but still had a hint of sweetness- he recommended the Bordeaux by the glass and it was wonderful! It was exactly what I was imagining. My friend ordered the Chardonnay and said it was exactly what she wanted- a summertime wine. You can pick a bottle off the shelves and drink it there (they do charge a $7 corkage fee) and you can take it home if you don't finish it. They have a wonderful selection of bottles and wines by the glass to choose from and they are affordable options! I know sometimes people who don't drink wine are deterred from wine bars but this wine bar also serves a great list of draft and bottled craft beers. The food was also really good! We split the Avocado Toast (a summer special) and the White Hot flatbread pizza. The creamy Asiago cheese on the flatbread was soooooo good! Their menu is simple and delicious.,positive
"Great food. Great service. Our server, Amy, was wonderful and the manager, Pete is quite a character and really made sure everyone felt at home. 10/10 would recommend.",positive
Such a cute place. Small inside but flatbread pizzas and wine selection is really good. Staff there is very friendly and treats everybody well. Enjoy going there!,positive
"Staff is pleasant and the wine is great! They also have some good happy hour deals. I've eaten here and have never been disappointed. One time my friend and I were looking to purchase some wine, and the person helping us was extremely knowledgeable! Love this place and would definitely recommend.",positive
"I loved the atmosphere. It felt nice and cozy. I love having a local wine bar in Brecksville. The bar was not loud even on a Saturday night. We had a delicious flat bread, the ingredients tasted fresh. The service in my opinion was good they gave you space while still coming by to refill your beverage. I will definitely be back.",positive
"I was tooling around the Brecksville area on a recent afternoon and spotted 750 ml on a corner. I wandered in to peruse the wine/beer selection but I ended up tasting a red wine flight. What a great place to try ecclectic wines that aren't offered at other places!!! I was warmly greeted by Frank and sat at one of six tables aligning a stainless steel bar. Behind me was a wall of wine that I was able to wander through while tasting. I ordered a red wine flight of Spanish tempranillo, a french bordeaux, a California red blend (sweet), and an Australian shiraz. Frank placed them on a gorgeous wooden (pine?) server with hand-written descriptions so that I knew which I was tasting. He presented them in order from dry to sweet so that the wines would be palatable. I have to mention the fact that they don't serve food until 4:00 pm. I was happy with the fact that I walked in the front door and wasn't overwhelmed with the fragrance of food. This is the PERFECT atmosphere in which to taste wine! Our next stop will be 750ml in Fairlawn!",positive
What a wonderful wine bar. I had one of the wine flight and got to sample a few different wines. I even discovered a red that I finally enjoy while I was here. The server was very knowledgeable and help guide me to a new fun wine tasting experience. I can't wait to go back again.,positive
"I really like the atmosphere of this place, and I definitely enjoyed my wine flight and bento box of snacks. I was disappointed in the service, however. The service was fine while we were seated at the table and ordering from the menu, but when we were perusing the wine selection looking for some gifts and bottles to take home, no one offered to help us. We eventually gave up and went to Heinen's.",negative
Was in there several times the people are rude. The food was marginal at best. When the food came out and was not cooked thoroughly I asked for the manger Frank came out was rude and said the food is usually good but I must be picky. The owner happened to be there and she was not nice as well. I feel my money spends anywhere and it won't be spent at 750ml.,negative
"I highly enjoyed the wine flight that I ordered. They have a very large selection of wines at very good prices. My friend and I ordered the Sriracha Hummus to start and it was just okay. It was pretty much just your typical plain hummus with Sriracha squirted on top. But, I am a HUGE olive fan and the olives that came with the hummus were to die for! We also shared the White Hot flatbread and similar to the hummus, it was nothing special. Asiago spread as the sauce with grilled chicken, cheese and red pepper flakes... My takeaway? Go here to drink...eat elsewhere!",negative
"This review is mostly about the wine club that they offer. I don't think their wine picks are exceptionally good and the price per bottle didn't seem discounted. If I'm committing to buying wine every month I would expect to get a better deal. We used to live in wine country in Oregon and all of the wine clubs discounted the bottles that were included in the shipments. Also, they could offer memberships that were quarterly so that you can get nicer bottles instead of having to buy cheaper bottles monthly. We have also been here for drinks a few times. I like that it is local and there is such a good selection of wines. There is a corking fee if you don't choose off of the menu (which is sad because they have such a huge and awesome selection that is not on the menu), and it seems a little high. The service seems hit or miss. Would like to try the food but haven't yet.",negative
"I'm not sure why this wine bar is rated so poorly. The service has always been great, there's good food, reasonable prices with varying specials in flights or pints, and obviously a great selection of wine. As for the decor, it resembles the exact feel of California's small tasting rooms. What a treat in NEO!!",positive
"Wife and I went to 750ml for the first time on Friday. We were with a large group of 8. Here are my thoughts. Downstairs was tight as other Yelpers mentioned. To me no big deal as they are doing what they can with the space they have. Wine selection was actually pretty good and prices seemed in line. We went upstairs and it was nice. They really need a few chairs opposite the bench seats though. The decor in general was nice. The wait staff did a nice job for us. They ran out of wine glasses so it took a bit of time to get our drink on but once we got going they were very attentive. One other nit pic issue is that I feel the Reds were served way too warm. I'm also thinking what happened is the glasses were washed and dried and were hot when they were poured into. Almost forgot, the food was very good. Especially the mushroom flatbread and the bruschetta. We will return for sure.",positive
"Wife and I have driven past multiple times and decided to give 750ml a try. Bad decision.....interior was okay, kind of blahhhh. We walked in and looked around, no one acknowledged us, so we just sat at a table. A server came over and asked what we wanted to drink.....I asked to see a wine list first....really? I asked my wife. After an awkward 5 minutes we ordered. We decided to share a flatbread. Raw chicken! We told our waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen. We told her we didn't want it back and they still billed us for it. To sum up our experience, we felt forgotten from the time we walked in to the non-existent thank you when we left. Staff huddled in the corner chit chatting, customers waiting long times. Better options in the area.",negative
"We had the Tuscan flatbread which was good - but could have been a bit hotter - it was only semi-warm. The staff needs customer service training. They are still not sure what to do, or when to do it. The bartender gave us our menu, we figured out what we wanted, then she said, ""Oh you can't order that - you have the wrong menu"". The atmosphere could be warmer. It is very modern, stiff and sterile. The metal chairs were not comfortable - they looked like prison seating.",negative
"Atmosphere is nice, limited seating. However they were completely unprepared for their opening. Several times the servers passed us by. We sat for over 15 minutes and were never acknowledged.",negative
I'm don't eat a chains much but I'll stop in to my neighborhood Applebee's when I'm feeling it. This location in particular is great! The staff is attentive and they care about your experience. That Kind of service honestly makes the meal a little bit better. I usually get the 2 for 25$ with my buddy and it's honestly an amazing deal.,positive
Great place I enjoyed the service and my server was amazing definitely recommend this location for a great meal and even better service thank you Libby,positive
"Dollar margaritas is what got the group in, but the great service (plus mediocre to satisfactory food) is why it's A-OK in my book. Mike (working at the bar) was super responsive and efficient when over 20 of us pedaled into the restaurant from a late evening bicycle ride. He doled out our drinks for the entire party at once, took our orders, split our checks and didn't disappoint in any part of his service. As for the late night happy hour food, the nachos were a bit too soggy and spicy for my tastes, but the boneless chicken wings were as expected.",negative
"I usually don't frequent Applebees but there's a good reason why this location has 2 stars. We sent one meal back because it came out cold, only to get a steak so inedible that I wouldn't feed it to my enemies dog. The only saving grace was our server, Leah was very nice and made it right by having it taken off the bill. I won't be coming back.",negative
"Hi, I don't know why People is not giving a good review!! It doesn't make sense! It's the best staff ever.. I love them all.. I wish Natasha was a server. She always smiles at customers faces. I like the mangers there too.. also the bartender Mike and Kyle, they will take care of you every time you go there. Frank is the best manger you can have. It's really great staff! Hire Natasha to be the server at the tables :) we all want her! Rakan,",positive
Walked in at 12:30pm and was blown away by the wait staff. I have had meals for $300 per person that didn't have such good service. Waiter was there in under thirty seconds whenever I raised my hand but otherwise didn't distract me from my meal and audiobook. Food was above average and cooked as perfectly as is possible with pasta.,positive
"The hostess was awesome. She held the door for me and had a bubbly personality. This is the type of person you want working at the front. I was seated right away. I had the steak with shrimp on top. It was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that the side of broccoli came in huge pieces. It was a little overwhelming and just different. I like broccoli but the pieces needs to be smaller, not the size of little trees. My server was very nice and attentive. The restaurant was clean but they were playing Spanish music the whole time I was there. It was just a little odd since this is a neighborhood grill. Other guests at the restaurant were also making comments regarding the music. The manager on duty was not seen at all. Normally they make their rounds which I feel is important.",positive
I'm surprised people eat here and downright shocked that people order food to go. Applebees is gross. I wait for my husband to pick me up at the one at Rural and Broadway after work and the place is one step up from a total dive. The staff is friendly which is the only good thing about the place.,negative
Second time we have been to this location. The first time isn't wasn't great we decided to try it again and this time was even worse. All our food was cold. My daughters salad had a hair in it. Will never go here again!,negative
"Very unpleased .... Service was ridiculously not to par ... Hardly any people eating but took almost an hour to get the food... Waitress messed up both orders ... Then messed up the bill uncountable times first undercharged my self then fixed the bill to over charge both of us ... Then said there was MORE TO PAY and ""which one of you is gunna pay the extra $7"" ... I was floored and very upset asked to speak to a manager who seemed to be completely out of it???? Offered us a $5 coupon off NEXT order of a two entree purchase you have to be kidding me ... Why would i give you guys MORE money smh. I was extremely displeased would not recommend to anyone. Didn't even take the coupon is was so irritated.... DONT GO THERE ITLL RUIN A GOOD DAY",negative
Poor service. The wait staff was inconsiderate during Thanksgiving. We waited 20 minutes before we were told to wait even longer. We just left at that point.,negative
"I came here because a girlfriend of mine wanted to get drinks after work. I haven't been to an Applebee's in such a long time. I was surprised at just how tasty the drinks were. Ok. Fine. I had a burger and fries too. Stop judging me! That was pretty good too. For being a chain restaurant, I have no complaints. The service was fast and friendly. Made for a really good experience.",negative
"HORRIBLE service! Upon walking in, there was no host/hostess at all. I stood there awkwardly waiting for at least a minute or two before I was even acknowledged. After I was finally seated, I sat there for at least 5 minutes before the waiter (Troy, I believe) said he would be right with me. I was waiting for my friend to arrive, but he still did not come back to even ask what I wanted to drink. I sat there for 20 minutes (my friend finally arrived by then) before he came over to see what we wanted. After being starving from not eating much all day, my patience was pretty thin. After waiting so long, what I wanted was a sincere apology, but instead he tried to brush it off with some humor instead. I never got a refill on my drink even once. The waiter also acted extremely unprofessional and talked to us like one of his ""buds."" I asked him if something on the menu was good and he even said ""I try not to eat where I work so I don't really know."" This is the second time I have received terrible service at this location so I will NOT be returning here. The only reason I even came back was because I had a gift card for Applebee's and it was the closest location to me. Go somewhere else for dinner!!",negative
"Amazing service! My friend and I were sat at a booth right away and our waitress Ashley was there in seconds ready to get us drinks. She was fun, easy to talk to, and very helpful with our food selection. She even understood our weird dislike of bacon lol. I would definitely go back again.",positive
"If you haven't been then you are missing out! We call this the gem of Tempe! You will not find another place that serves colder beer on tap! The blue moon is a personal favorite and you won't be disappointed! Their great happy hour as well as content food deals including .40 cent wings will make you wanting to come back again and again! Joey is by far the best bartender so if he is there say hi and ask for his ""Strong Island"" made by Joey!",positive
"My boyfriend and I ordered take out from this location and it was absolutely disappointing. First of all, they told us our order would be ready at 9 pm and we didnt get our food until 9:45. Second of all, we ordered the Triple Hog Dare You which was so bad that my boyfriend didn't eat it. We also ordered cheese fries which looked and tasted like they were a day old, again, we didn't even eat them. I also ordered the shrimp scampi. It had way too much butter and the breadstick was stale. For our whole meal we paid $45 and waited over 1 hour. This is the second chance we give this Applebees and it is safe to say I will never be returning. The service is bad and the food is worse.",negative
Always have a great time here!! Was greeted immediately after entering the restaurant. Drink came out fast .. It take a minute to get a refill ... But food was hot!! & everything was delicious:-). Will be back,positive
"As we first walked into the restaurant, the hostess was having a sidebar conversation with someone, even though seeing us, continued the conversation until finished, then gave us a giant fake smile.. felt like I was on some prank TV show. When she sat us down, our server came by and asked for drinks when we just barely sat down, haven't even looked at the menu yet so just ordered water. During the time my mother and I waited for our meal, we could hear the female bartender having a conversation with one of the guests of how she loves to party, doesn't know who her daughters father is and how she hates getting low tips from customers. Her and the guest were flirty and the entire conversation was entirely inappropriate. Our meal finally came, by the manager himself, not our actual server. The manager did NOT carry a tray for our food, he had each hand with a plate. As he was putting my mothers meal on the table, he stuck his thumb in her hamburger as he was setting the plate down.. EEEWWW!!!! Then he sat my plate down, all of my meal looked dried out, and it tasted like it too. I asked the manager for lemon slices before he left so I can add it to my water (ended up using it on the food instead). A few minutes went by and the server came by and asked us how our meal was, I said ""It's just ok."" As it was. He didn't ask why it was just ok, he just walked away and left. Once our meals were done, he gave us a check, had the card sitting on it to have it taken and took forever to get out of there. Then my mom asked about the hamburger she ordered to go, if we will be getting it anytime soon... he forgot it, figures. Will NEVER come back there and would never recommend. If I wanted IHOP service, I would have just gone to IHOP.",negative
"Terrible service, jerk of a bar tender, he was disrespectful to the hostess in front of customers. We got served water and 25 minutes later asked what we wanted to eat. Do not go to this location",negative
"Its Applebees, nothing wow about it, just the happy hour deal. Came to this place one evening on a weekday with my brother and his Fiance for drinks. There was a woman at the table next to us who honestly should had been cut off a long time ago, she was so sauced up, loud and obnoxious that our time spent there was ultimately just unpleasant, after much observation, she seemed to know the staff, what do you know, she works there. UNPROFESSIONAL. Not returning to this location anytime soon.",negative
The hostess (Ricki) here is really nice and the food she suggested hit the spot. What's not to like great hostess coo food and beer! My son also thought the hostess was awesome!,positive
"I took a couple of friends here for happy hour we had to wait till the exact time to get the better price, we asked the manager if we could get the happy hour price and she was very firm on no but finally she budged and gave in. Well the food I ordered was bad it was the blackened fish it smelled really bad it was not fresh so I had them take it back and got something else, that took a while to get that and by the time they brought it back my friends were already done with there meal so I took mine to go. Please approach with caution",negative
What can I say about Applebee's? It's an American chain restaurant. Food options are standard fare. Their Spinach & Artichoke Dip is what had me coming here back in the day but now my palate has matured. REALLY nice servers tho. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is the best thing I've had here; albeit overpriced in comparison to similar desserts around town.,negative
"Tacky and unfriendly atmosphere. Every server and employee (besides the annoyingly over-friendly hostess) seemed to be on the cusp of giving into their suicidal urges. Can't help but think ""Shenanigans"" from the movie ""Waiting"". Managerial staff attempts a fake niceness that is half ass-ed and transparent. Food was highly mediocre and seemed to be made from very cheap ingredients. If you were planning on eating at a chain like this, the ""Chili's"" on Mill Ave & University is an infinitely better bet (still an average place, but with a better atmosphere and better service).",negative
"Ugh...I've been on a losing streak lately while getting lunch. Tried Applebee's for lunch on Tuesday. I hadn't been to one in years, and figured ""why not""? I should have asked myself ""why""? Service was pretty good, hence the two stars. They have a ""14 minute guarantee"" so that once you place your order, they guarantee you'll have food in 14 minutes or it's free. The food was out within that time frame, I assume...I didn't have a stopwatch out but it seemed quick enough. I wish they'd taken longer to make it good. I could put some crappy chicken on a plate at home in under 14 minutes, but I pay someone else to do it in hopes that out will turn out better. It didn't. It was worse. Overcooked boneless wings that were overly breaded and tossed in poorly flavored sauce...Pretty much a swing and a miss all around. Also overpriced for what you get...It's simply not worth it at all. If you ever find yourself in this ""neighborhood"" (see what I did there?), just drive on by. I need to find the Applebee's that John Corbett has been going to...Until then I think I'll pass on a second trip to this place.",negative
"Here for happy hour on a hump day. Service was great! I had the dip, chunks of tender artichoke, chips light and salty. My BF liked the Asian wings. Long islands were tasty and not too strong.",positive
"Why so many bad reviews! I've had most of the items on the menu. The happy hour is awesome, too bad there's no happy hour on Saturdays, thats really lame. Other than that, the service is always great, hostesses and waiters are always friendly no matter how intoxicated our crowd is. The boneless wings are tasty and spicy and the artichoke dip is good with anything. Dont get Bahama Mama's or you will be called a wuss, forever. Long Island Iced Tea's are ok and the prices on beer are decent. For a while they had 2 for 1 shots of Patron....ah that was great. Contrary to popular belief, Patron and mozarella sticks DO mix.",positive
"My husband and I don't eat at chain restaurants very frequently...we try to avoid them when possible. Saturday night when trying to decide where to go out for dinner (we are running out of food in our house), I had a list of places I want to try. However, my husband didn't want to spend more than $30 on dinner (no clue why), so all of my ideas were out the window. We decided on Applebee's since I had a slight craving for a mucho mudslide. The only highlight of our trip to Applebee's was my mucho mudslide (it was yummy). My fried chicken salad was large for a half-size and was pretty good. I'd be concerned if a place could really mess something up as simple as that. My husband got the ultimate trio (basically he got to pick three appetizers)...he ordered the mozzarella sticks (blah...they were barely hot and not as good as they used to be back in the day); the sliders (what is up with every place, not fancy and fancy, having sliders on the menu nowadays??), and chicken wraps (Chris said they were OK). Our service was worse than the food. It took over 10 minutes after we placed our drink order for our drinks to appear on the table. No clue why it took that long because the bar area wasn't busy and the bartender didn't look backed up. Second, it took our food forever to come out...we have no clue why. A mother and daughter walked in after we placed our dinner order and when I glanced over wondering where our food was, I noticed they were eating! They got food before we did!!! GRRRRRRR. Our bill came to $28, but it was hardly worth it. On our drive home, we said we should have just gone to Wendy's for dinner...better quality food at a much much cheaper price.",negative
"I just spent $14 for a barely mediocre soup and salad. As the food was nothing special, I had lots of time to think. Here's what I came up with: 1) If I was going to ASU this would be the place to hang out. Why? Because you don't seem to find freshmen here. It's close to the university, but not RIGHT on campus. What was all around me? Upper class-men. And what were they talking about? School. In one hour long lunch I know people's grades, which teachers are fair in several subjects, tricks to doing philosophy papers in Mr. What's his name's class, how to get into a particular program without an interview and a bevy of other university delights. I even heard someone getting a killer deal on a rental house and someone looking for housing. One stop shopping. 2) I hate that Applebee's is one of the only places I can safely go now that I've become a dreaded nutrition/calorie counter. Their Weight Watcher's menu let's me order in complete confidence. I actually have options! I took a friend to Essence the other day (Applebee's polar opposite in all ways, and one of my favorite places to go) and I was really stuck. There is no nutritional information. They have no idea which of their items have less calories. No idea of the sodium content of that chicken salad. I made a ""I think this will work"" guess, but I'm pretty sure I under estimated when I was attempting to over estimate. I love going to independently owned places. I miss it. I really really do. But today when I was just way more hungry than that frozen meal was going to solve Applebee's was my only safe option in the area. 3) This location's Weight Watcher meals aren't as good as some other locations. There shouldn't be a difference in a chain - but boy oh boy is there! 4) Other folks around me were happily devouring their food. A table of girls eating behind me was on their 2nd helpings of unlimited soup and salad for $5.99. I suppose the rest of their fare is fairly standard Applebee's stuff. 5) While I don't want to repeat this again any time soon, My guess is that I'll be back here at least once every 2 months because I want something beyond what I brought to work. Just the thought of it makes me a bit queasy. 6) If I'm willing to pay $14 for crappy soup and salad (for only 400 calories) in a crappy place, with crappy surroundings - why can't more independent places step up and offer some healthy options they can be proud of? Proud enough to post those nutritional numbers on the menu. Heavens knows I'm not the only one...",negative
"the whole idea of applebee's really bothers me. chain restuarants that you can go to all over the country just seem weird. it seems so much more worth it to try something new and unique and risk it not being great than going somewhere that introduced that obnoxious song about baby back ribs... oh wait, that was chiles. well, i feel the same way about that restaurant too. the only times i came here were to do their happy hour, which is pretty good, if you can stand the atmosphere. the HH hours are pretty impressive; 3 to 7 and 10 to midnight every night of the week. other than that - gross, gross, gross",negative
"The place WAS good! The food, quality and quantity. The service ... Meh .. They had their days. And the decor WAAS nice. Yea, WaS! They have closed down! Too bad :(",positive
Pros: place is clean and staff is well dressed. Aprons are clean which is something I always notice Spring roll- never disappoints. Nice and crispy. Hot with a delectable dipping sauce. Cons: They are moving over to a self serve style Feb 1. That will be a nightmare I'm sure. They will take your order- but you have to pick it up. They are having difficulty finding full-time servers. Service is very slow. Not friendly but pleasant and present.Took at least 20 mins to place my order and coffee and place was empty. They don't seem to care if you are there or not. Never got asked for a refill on coffee and had to ask for water. All in all if you are not looking for great service but decent food. You'll be okay coming here. It's not the greatest but it'll do.,negative
"Really good place. I like variety of food there and the prices. Don't go there for lunch, by some reason the quality of food is always better at dinner. Our favorite Asian place in the area.",positive
"Tried their short ribs, sushi rolls, and general tsos. I would eat the short ribs again. Their glaze is a little bit sweeter than what I have had before. General tsos were okay too.",negative
"all together - OK we had two rolls of Sushi - a bit boring and dry, nothing great - seems like I can do the same at home ...not bad - just simple - some how I expected more, presentation was simple on round black dish we also had General Tzao Chicken and it was again plain and maybe less than OK, not spicy, chicken was warm not hot and moist in heavy sauce if you are in a need for lunch it's OK for about $7 per dish - just do not expect top dishes and sushi",negative
"If I wanted to make my wife happy, I bring home Azian! Need I say more? But in all honesty, the sushi is always fresh, the menu is reasonably priced and the service is friendly and great. Don't ever hesitate to eat here! And throw an invite my way too please?",positive
"Ordered take out of 3 items of corn soup, fried rice and sweet n sour chicken. The soup and fried rice were overly salty, and the white rice that came with the chicken tasted a few days old. We order take out often and have noticed a decline of food quality.",negative
Pretty good takeout with a large selection. Not the best and inexpensive in the area though. Nice for a combination of different Asian flavours though.,negative
This was my 2nd visit. Previously I had come for takeout and recalled that it was decent enough here. Today I had lunch. I couldn't decide from their vast menu. Opted for the Thai combo. The pumpkin soup was absolutely Delilsh. I can't say the same for the rest though. The bar was set high with the soup. The combo included Basil chicken ( pretty tasty) pad Thai ( non greasy which is good in my books) mango salad - a bit lack luster and bland. And pineapple for dessert. Also had iced green tea with honey - pretty good. Overall pretty good service and nice decor. Would like to try their sushi and see how that fairs.,positive
"Food was decent, and service was ok. Given the fact they serve, Thai, Chinese and Sushi though, the menu tends to be pretty big...almost too big.",negative
"I've known about this place since it opened. I've been there a bunch of times since and it has been very consistent with the quality of food and with the service. Great food, great atmosphere, the only thing I'm not a fan of is the distance it takes to get there. Thank g-d my fiancee lives in the area",positive
"We were dreading being out in ""the suburbs"" for dinner. A month of burned promises and our obligation to meet the family in their neck of the woods was suddenly being called into effect. We pull up to the faceless souless strip mall and start planning to have a generic box-restaurant experience. Thankfully, looks can sometimes be deceiving. We order the Vegetarian combo. It's awesome. Period. Such an unexpected surprise! Can't wait until this chain spreads.",positive
"My brother and I had dinner at the new Maple location last night. Service was fabulous (although it was a slow night) and the ambiance was nice. Decor is cool and modern - very comfortable. The menu is varied. There are Japanese, Chinese and Thai options. We had trouble making a decision. We order salmon sashimi which was very good. I also enjoyed the Tom Yum soup with shrimp but it didn't blow me away. My favourite Tom Yum soup is still from Spring Rolls. We ordered the Sushi and Maki (set for 2) with brown rice (a nice option) for 29.99. My favourite was the spicy tuna roll. We were trying to stay away from the fried food of which there is plenty on this menu. I was dying to try and soft shell crab and the mango chicken and various other dishes including tempura (my favourite) but since I am trying to lose weight, I wisely stayed away. Will definitely come back and try some other dishes, especially their combos and chef exclusives. The waiter was lovely and knowledgeable. I would love to see this restaurant succeed so give it a try.",positive
"This is our ""go to"" restaurant! The quality of the food is always great and we absolutely love the staff...shout out to K.T, Shannon and Josh! The team always works hard to make you feel at home! Keep up the good work!!",positive
"This is probably the best Italian food in town--but I literally drive in from over 30-miles away for the service! The staff and management here are so nice and responsive!! The manager, Alex, made some amazing dessert recommendations!! We will definitely be back!!!",positive
"I've eaten at Bravo before, and it was always just an average meal. This time that I went, I had possibly one of the worst dining experiences in my life. First off, when I went to use the restroom before eating, it smelled like a carnival outhouse. Completely disgusting. There was urine on the floor. If I hadn't been so starving at the time, I would have walked out. We asked for bread (during previous visits, it was brought out after beverages) and the waitress said, ""oh you want it now?"" Which rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered the Chicken Scallopini and asked for her to leave the Chicken off of it because i don't eat meat. She made a confused face and asked me if I wanted something instead, but I didn't know what options I had, so I just asked her to add extra mushrooms to it. When I got my dish, it looked... sad. There were two whole portobellas laying beside some twirled pasta. The portion seemed small compared to my friend's spaghetti. As I cut into the mushrooms, I saw that they were scalloped horizontally, almost paper thin. I have never in my life seem a mushroom cut that way. I had many bites that were just stem. The mushrooms were also extremely undercooked. It was hard enough to find something to eat because they don't have vegetarian options other than salad and eggplant parm. (I don't like eggplant). I didn't return the dish because I couldn't bare to be there anymore. I will never go here again. This place has awful service, dated recipes, high prices, and paper on their tables, on top of the table cloth. (Thought that seemed trashy).",negative
"Great food,, took our son and his soul mate to dinner, his choice, his favorite place,, first the reservation were nice and easy to make. They also let us bring our home made wine,, the service is one of the best, The food is awesome, we have been here many times. This is truly a restaurant.",positive
"Meh. I wasn't the one paying for my full course meal, but if I was, not the place I would choose. I ordered a pasta with shrimp and lots of garlic, and it was very greasy. I also shared a New York steak. I asked for medium rare, but it was cooked more like medium well. Furthermore, I was unsatisfied with the service. I came with a group of 6 people. We clearly saw large, empty tables, but the hostess at the front said that we would have to wait for about 30-40 minutes. I pulled out my OpenTable app and saw a table for 6 in ten minutes. I made my reservation and we were seated ten minutes later at my reservation time. I do not plan on returning. -- taste / 3 aesthetics / 3 vibe / 3 service / 1 price for quality / 2 OVERALL / 2.4",negative
Stood in like for 25 minutes just to be told the wait would be at least two hours without reservations. There were numerous empty tables and the staff was very unprofessional. The host would walk about for 10 minutes at a time and stand in the back just talking to other workers. Very pissed and will never be returning.,negative
"Very slow inefficient service. Food was good. Went at 5 on a Wednesday, told the wait was 15 to 20 minutes though the restaurant was half empty. I assume poor management.",negative
"Awful experience! I frequent Bravos on McKnight and even have a frequent diner's card. Have to admit that there have been inconsistencies in food and service in the past. But last night (Thurs) a friend and I went for happy hour. We sat at the high top table in the bar area. There was another table of four next to us. No one approached our table for at least 15 minutes. The folks at the other table were looking around trying to catch the attention of the waiter. They wanted a drink refill. I don't know what this waiter's problem was, but he was certainly not ""waiting"" on anyone. Eventually he did come and plop down the menus..took our drink orders,,,never asked if I wanted anything in my martini...I could go on and on. And my food was awful. Ordered the scallops marinara. The scallops were the smallest I have ever seen even for bay scallops. It was very spicy as well. The only redeeming event was that the GM came over to ask about our experience. Once I complained, he went right over to talk to the waiter. I wish I could say that this helped. It didn't.",negative
"Went there for the 1st and only time on Easter. Food great but service was horrible. Took 37 minutes after ordering to get Soup and Salad, probably an additional 30 minutes after that to get entrees. Waitress was extremely inattentive. Will not be returning",negative
"Not normally a fan of chain restaurants but this doesn't even feel like one! Authentic, fresh, Italian food. The entire staff is very friendly and hospitable. I normally sit at their bar, and I don't even feel like I am at a restaurant bar, but a neighborhood place with friends. Everybody is so nice! This location just underwent a remodel and looks so beautiful. Their private room has an elegant, upscale feel.",positive
"I have been going to bravo on mcknight for years! I typically dine there for lunch, there are many wonderful servers, but Sherri is the server I know the best! she is AMAZING! Everytime I come in she waits on me, and always has a smile.. I will continue to dine there because of the friendly staff and the delicious food!..The best is the Romano chicken salad!!!",positive
"My daughter and her friends which are in High School went to this location before their homecoming dance. My daughter got a bowl of soup and her bill was $5.00. They all paid with separate checks. My daughter gave the server a $20 bill for her $5.00 check. They waited a long time for the server ( red hair server, she doesn't remember his name) to bring their change back. She finally waved him over, she asked him directly for her change and he said, ""I thought we were all square"" and walked away!!! He knowingly kept my daughters money and the rest of her friends change. She knows how to tip and was going to tip him. But he did not listen when she asked for her money. That is so wrong to take advantage of kids!! I called the Manager and still no resolution.",negative
"I have been here twice and neither time was a bad experience. Last night we were seated right away and our service was descent. It wasn't packed by any means for a Monday night but they had a good crowd. Our waiter was very friendly, however, my only gripe was it took a long time in between his stops to check on us but we overlooked it. The bread and oil is delicious. I think I ate about 7 pieces of bread! I stayed with the Wedding soup and Caprese Salad. The Wedding Soup was good but I think only had one meatball :-( The Caprese Salad was very fresh. The mozzarella cheese and tomatoes tasted like they just received them. They had a balsamic glaze over top which was very tasteful and a nice touch. Recommend.",positive
I enjoyed my meal I just felt as though something was missing... More flavor ? More pasta :/ over all it was delicious with good service but I would have preferred more seasoning!,positive
"This is my favorite go-to restaurant in Ross Township. The food is consistently good, as are my favorite things to order. The Della Casa salad is great as an entree with the wedding soup, or as a side salad to the Chicken Parmesan. Yesterday's meal seemed a little slow to reach the table when the manager came to apologize for the delay. She had seen my meal that was about to be delivered and didn't think the pasta looked up to their standard presentation. It took a few minutes longer, but I received a deliciously prepared and presented meal! Then she offered a free dessert to eat there or take home to make up for the delay! She went the extra distance, without my asking, and impressed us at the table. Thank you! Much appreciated.",positive
"I was very unimpressed with this place. I went here around 2005-6 if I recall and it was much better. We got Calamari Fritti and Crispy Shrimp Napoli. The calamari was over-cooked, chewy and flavorless. We only ate 50% of the calamari because it was nasty. 1/5 stars. The shrimp were probably the best tasting thing we had during the entire dinner. 5/5 I had grilled mahi-mahi and my girlfriend had the spicy scallop pasta. Her dish was 4/5 stars and mine was around 2/5. The fish was over-cooked and bland despite an advertised lemon butter sauce. The vegetables were also bland and seemed as if olive oil was poured over them. Add a glass of wine and 1 Yuengling and the tab was $75.",negative
"Ok where do I begin, I suppose when we first walk in Bravo we were greeted by an unfriendly not smiling grumpy, snotty, nose in the air girl named Caitlyn this is the hostess I mean first impressions are everything. When we visit Pittsburgh we like to dine at Bravo because the food is good but next time we will not be back because of the crappy service. First of all my fiancée was told it would be a 45min wait I use opentable for everything ( when it's available ) so we actually already had reservations but the lady was not listening to us and couldn't find our name in the system. After the manager overheard her she looked & said Caitlyn the reservation is right here and I'll seat them right away. She gave us the biggest eye roll ever ! So rude We're seated right away by Sara who's apologized at least 5 x already and really it's ok thank you for making it right. She brings 2 teas 1 lemonade and my vino, the teas were good nice and dark the lemonade was fresh, I guess the accidentally poured 2 glasses so I got 1 free I'm ok with that Now Alex comes over I think he's the manager and he said he overhead the hostess being rude and apologized so he offered us any appetizer of our choice for free. Very kind of him We picked the chicken, bacon, spinach & cheese flat bread. Omg am I glad we did because it was Delish Nice and crunchy corners soft middle, bacon cooked to perfection enough to feed 3 men and a little lady. My Entree: very good fresh Brussel sprout & almond salad with a lemon vinaigrette. Super fresh greens with tender chicken added Italian wedding soup: it could have been warmer since it was freezing outside, carrots, little meatballs orzo and a yummy broth was all swimming around in my cute little soup bowl. I can't complain to much it was yummy The Bravo Spaghetti that was brought out to my brother in law looked very good, thin noodles a medium amount of meat sauce he said it was tasty a solid 7 ! My man had the Bolognese, again very tasty, nice portion size, the noodles cooked to perfection. A solid 9! My son had the chicken Caesar salad he loved it nice fresh chicken and lettuce was fresh So the food was great but the service sucked in the beginning, however the management teamed up and took great care of us ! So Bravo to the management at Bravo you did a great job but we might just visit a different location next time we're in Pittsburgh",negative
"I was so disappointed with Bravo last night. I haven't been there for awhile and they have changed the menu and apparently the cooking. I doubt if I will ever return, my pasta was really, really bad.. I noticed the place was almost empty, it used to be jammed packed and one had to wait to be seated, there seemed to be more staff than diners. I guess others have noticed the change in the food and menu and are not returning. I will say the server was pleasant and efficient, but that does not make up for bad food. Sorry Bravo, but it's ""Arrivederci"" . You were one of my favorites, but no longer.",negative
"--- There is nothing Italian about this franchise chain--- Food is mostly with some tomato sauce base that is acidic. Many of the dishes are heavily loaded with tasteless, texture less pasta likely made from dried preprocessed material. --- Why is it that many of their sort of restaurant claim to be Italian, when many of their entrees are not? --- Chicken strangled in pasta is a disgrace to Italian cuisine!!! Chicken is not a garnish. Pasta is not a side dish. No discussion.--- Perhaps a small measure of redemption is some of their pizza, which surprisingly is well seasoned with the right proportion of cheese.",negative
"I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday and seriously had one of the worst meals of my life. I mean it's Bravo's so I guess what should I expect? But, let's begin: We were sat in a corner, waited 10 minutes ( I timed it) before our server even greeted us, then placed our order (they were out of what I wanted of course.) She brought us some bread and dipping sauce, which was the only good thing we had, and our drinks. We got our salads and she walked away, we had no silverware which was really cool. After I had to find her to ask for it, we proceeded to eat the salad which has no dressing. Our sever, of course, was nowhere to be found so we flagged down another one who then had to ""ring in"" dressing. I mean seriously??! You couldn't just go and get a cup of dressing?!?! So we wait a few minutes for dressing... And then I had the entire core of the lettuce in my salad, a salad which was disgusting. On to the ""amazing"" entrees, my mom's lasagna was burnt to a crisp and my ""grilled"" chicken pesto spaghettini was water logged and tasted like bland nothingness. I'm now out of a drink and our server is still missing. When she finally makes an appearance, she sees my empty glass and asks me if I want more. (Sever 101: you don't ask, you just bring a fresh one or the pitcher. I know, I worked in a restaurant.) That took a good 5 minutes and she brings back a pitcher that had maybe 3-4 small sips of water in it. She finally asks how the food was and I said fine because I didn't even want to deal with it, but my mom said something. So the manager comes over.... It was seriously a fiasco. I will never ever go back. All in all the food sucked, the service was worse, and top it off their mints tasted like citrus mint bubblegum flavored chocolate. FOUL is an understatement. And now I'm just #HANGRY",negative
"Soooo I just had lunch here, and the food was pretty gross. Disappointed all around because I usually love eating at Bravo. The one in Cranberry is always on point, but I definitely won't be coming back to this location. Man, I don't even know where to start. Let's go with service. Everything took soooo long. It took our waiter 20 minutes to bring us stale bread that was clearly old. I couldn't even cut through it with a knife. The waiter apologized and all, but the ""fresh"" bread wasn't that much better. Then, my mom and I waited another 20 minutes for entrees which were salty and greasy. We ordered the Chicken Milenese and Pepperoni & Meatball Manicotti. The manicotti was ridiculously greasy - drowning in oil, ugh. On top of it all, the filling was mad mushy. My mom's chicken was straight up gross. The oil had this nasty smell to it - I don't really know how to describe it. They probably used old oil that's been sitting there, double ugh. Plus, the chicken tasted super gamey. The only thing edible on her dish was the herb linguine which was mediocre at best. Bah, super disappointed. If you're in the mood for Italian, I suggest driving the extra distance and goin' to the Cranberry location.",negative
"My wife and I own and operate a business together. Our business relies heavily on uniform customer service. I've had customers walk in late, it's not fun. How you assess and treat them makes the difference between a positive review and a poor one. So when my wife and I stopped in an hour before close at Bravo Cucina Italiana, I expected sparse clientele, but expected good food and service none the less.We work long hours and barely get to celebrate the fruits of our accomplishments, but on the evening of our eighth anniversary, I'd hoped only for a quiet meal and not to be rushed. The hostess' demeanor was a perfect match for her dark, disheveled hair and makeup. She made it plain that she was not happy to have our patronage at that time. Her attitude and sour glances at check in and throughout dinner were enough to ruin any hope of a bit of peace at the end of our day. The shining jewel of the service was Tori our waitress. She held the balance between pressure from management and her obligation to treat us well, impeccably. I had a phenomenal gluten free pasta dish and my wife had her usual. Tori; thanks for the great service. The rest of you... so sorry to bother you at an inconvenient time. Josh",negative
"Average to above average in every which way. Started with caprese salad and wedding soup. Caprese salad was more of a balsamic vin tossed salad w tomatoes and mozz instead of your classic caprese. Mozz also wasn't the freshest. For an entree I had the chicken scallopini which was actually pretty tasty. Chicken was very fresh and the sauce was quite nice, alittle heavy though. Overall my biggest complaint would be the price of our meal, for the price you pay on an entree it should come with a side and a larger portion. The atmosphere and decor was nice but my girlfriend and I felt the tablecloths were unnecessary in this casual ""olive gardensque"" restaurant and to top it off they were pre-stained with tomato sauce when we sat down. A decent restaurant I would eat at if there was nothing else nearby of the same stature, but I would not go out of my way to make reservations in the future.",negative
"We are pretty much regulars at Bravo. One reason is that we were allowed to bring a bottle of wine in with us. We would usually sit at the kitchen counter and take our time eating, usually 3 courses and a few other drinks in between. We hated to eat slow and take up a table. We also tip very well since we are there for a while. We arrived on Sun night and sat at the counter with our wine. We ordered drinks and then the manager came up and said that no bottles were allowed anymore. I asked if we could have the bottle we brought in and were told no. I can understand the new policy, even thought I will not go there anymore, but by not allowing us to have the bottle we brought in one last time was insulting. We left carrying our bottle like we did something wrong and we will not return. Very poor way of handling the situation. Many other good Italian restaurants to frequent.",negative
"The servers seemed hurried and anxious, the place had just opened up, the Hostess was a friendly and very attractive young woman. The Wedding soup was bland and seemed like it was out of a can. The Penne Mediterranean wasn't any better. The pasta was undercooked, not even close to adante, their were four spinach leaves and what looked like a couple of sun dried tomatoes in the dish. The Feta cheese failed to make an appearance, a small amount of pine nuts rounded the dish out so that the Penne Mediterranean came out of a bag, or the chef did not care.",negative
"I received a gift card for Christmas to Bravo. It's always fun to eat for free, right? I have been to Bravo's before, but it's been a while. I remember them being a little ""classy"" on the inside. And I was right. The Bravo on McKnight is very classy looking. A very Italian like theme for restaurants. Love the broken looking pillars and beams. But, the bar area compared to other Bravo's I have been to was pretty small. Would have liked to see some high top tables in there and happy hour specials. That's always a win for the ""high priced chains"". The service... The service, although a bit slow, was overall pretty good. Our server had a bit of help with food runners and doggy baggers. That's got to be the technical term for that guys job! Onto the food... The Spinach Artichoke dip was like eating a crunchy piece of cardboard dipped into watered down spinach. I wasn't a fan of that at all. Their apps were definitely their weak point. The bread and oil had a flavor that I loved. Should have stuck to break and skipped the app. Meals were delicious. I had a veggie pasta, add chicken. My date had Lobster ravioli. I was quite unimpressed with the size of his dish. We are talking 1/3 the portion for his meal that was more expensive than mine. Dessert was delish. We got the cheesecake. Normally I am not a fan of cheesecake. This had a caramelized top with some sort of sauce and a strawberry. Overall, decent, but probably a bit overpriced for what it is. If it weren't for the gift card, I'd probably go for more local, but that's just my preference I guess.",negative
"Expect less. Pay more. The motto Bravo should use. I can't say that I dislike all chain restaurants, but I certainly dislike Bravo. It's highly overpriced for the ""Italian"" cuisine they serve, yet, there always seems to be a two hour wait on the weekends. Every time I have eaten there, I always left with a light wallet and a mediocre taste in my mouth. I know I don't need to eat there, but I am a strong believer in second chances. After my latest meal, which was a grilled chicken chopped salad that was coated in salt, I am saying goodbye to Bravo.",negative
"Bleecht. Bad, bad, bad. The one star that I give is for the dear friends with whom we ate. The sauce was disgusting and watered down. Chef Boyardee is better than the stuff that they try to pass off as ""Italian"". The service was really not great either-- the waitress was super sarcastic to the point of it being laughable, especially because she looked like a homeless person. Between that, and the cheesy plastic pillars and bad rococo art, you could not pay me to go back to this place. I find it hard to believe that anyone in Pittsburgh would eat at a Bravo, especially because of the mecca of amazing Italian restaurants here. It is a sub-par chain that gives fine cuisine a bad name. Go to Bloomfield instead for a much more authentic experience!",negative
"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. If you like Bravo and don't want to deal with the hassle, go to the Robinson location one. My fiancee and I arrived at 5:50pm and were quoted a 60-70 minute wait. Long time, but no problem. So an hour and 10 minutes go by. We noticed a couple of young high-schoolers walk in, hugging the hosts and talking to them. Then, five minutes later, were seated. They were not given a buzzer like everyone else. This happened a few different times while we waited. So, after waiting slightly AFTER our initial time, my fiancee asked the hosts how much longer it would be- ""just a few more minutes, lots of tables are opening up."" We waited for another twenty minutes, while people who had been there after us continued to get seated. Finally, an hour and a half after we had been waiting another lady who was waiting for a seat gave us HER buzzer because she found a seat at the bar. So, the only reason we were actually seated 30 minutes AFTER our quoted time was because someone else gave us their buzzer. When we walked up to the host stand with the buzzer, they looked at us, rolled their eyes, and waited another two minutes to get menus and seat us. So then we were seated and we told the waiter our ordeal, because he had asked us how long we were waiting. We weren't going to hold it against him, it wasn't his fault. However, when we asked him for cherry coke, he just told us they had coke, without offering to put grenadine in it for us...I know the bar carries grenadine, however he clearly didn't want to make an effort to put any in for us. So then we get our bread, without plates. Our waiter said ""Wow, it's like eating at an Ethiopian restaurant where you have to eat from a communal bowl."" Then he walked away. Seriously, I cannot make this stuff up. After using a small drink napkin as a makeshift plate, our house salads came. One of them came with dressing on the side, rather than already mixed into the salad per usual, which is not what we ordered. He said, ""Oh, I don't know why this is different, guess you'll just have to put it on the salad yourself."" Again, this is for real people. Alas, the manager came over and said, ""Sorry to interrupt you, I'm not going to lie, our kitchen screwed up your order. The chef asked me to come over and tell you that they have to remake the food and that he was sorry. So, sorry it is taking so long for your food, we screwed it up, but it's being fixed and should be out here soon."" He didn't seem sincere, he acted like it was a joke to him. Silly us thought that he might have been aware of our previous inconveniences and had come over to apologize. We were so dumbfounded by his clear lack of awareness that we didn't think he had the mental capacity to understand anything else if we were to explain it to him. He walked away and we decided to observe him. He is clearly the type of manager that is more interested in being the ""cool manager"" and goofing off, laughing with the hosts, than walking around and checking on the guests. We eventually got our food, two basic pasta dishes, and left after five minutes from receiving our food. We were so exhausted from the whole ordeal that we decided that it wasn't worth being at this poorly run restaurant any longer. After giving us our bill, our server said ""thanks for being patient, please come back again."" Honestly? Because you were so accommodating? No thanks. We actually had a bet going as to whether or not the hosts would stop talking to one another for five seconds and leaning sloppily on the host stand to say ""have a good night"" as we left, but alas my fiancee won the bet - they didn't say a word. We left, noticing that the time now was 8:30 pm. Throughout the whole night, the chef won best customer service for us because he at least recognized he screwed up...and he doesn't even work directly with guests obviously! This is seriously the Bravo from hell.",negative
"It's bravo! Or ""bravo's"" as my dad calls it. What's bad to say about it besides that it's a chain and has the chain restaurant feel to it. -1 one star for that. Good food. Good service. Clean. Good atmosphere. Had lunch here today and had the chicken, spinach and bacon flatbread. Yum! Moist chicken and well baked. Tasted as if they put their spinach dip on flatbread. Outstandingly good stuff. Had the fresh bread and sun dried tomato oil. I could eat just that and I would be satisfied most of the time. It was dad's birthday so right before the check came, they comped my dad a birthday sundae! good on them!",positive
Great place! Awesome service and delicious food. Highly recommend the honey walnut shrimp and the orange chicken. Honestly the best I've ever had.,positive
Great authentic food! Quick take out and amazing service inside. Love the jalapeño chicken and my son loves their orange chicken!,positive
We have gone to this place since it first opened. It is delicious! Never had a problem with our food. It is always served HOT and just made. The staff here is SOOOOO nice and the lady always asks about how are family is! She always remembers us! We love this place and my favorite is the egg drop soup and green tea! Super awesome small causual dining. The price is reasonable too! Great quality food for the right price!,positive
"I didn't realize I had to ask for sweet and sour sauce for my sweet and sour pork. This was a tale out delivery, so it wasn't noticed until I got home. Food is still good though.",negative
"First off when i eat chinese food i like to drink the hot tea which this place does not serve which is just my personal preference not everyones. Customer service here isnt that great, but the price point for the food is on point and the taste is pretty good compared to most the other restaurants in this area that serves chinese food.",negative
Great food and friendly service. I have tried several different menu items and they have all been wonderful. Reasonable prices too! My daughter believes they have one of the best curry dishes she has ever had.,positive
"Great service & food every time we go! We usually get fried rice, the lemon chicken, sweet & sour chicken, & Mongolian beef. We have yet to be disappointed.",positive
Another Americanized Chinese restaurant. Ordered the twice cooked pork and jalapeño beef. Nothing close to traditional Chinese cooking. Can't even come close to the Chinese food in cali,negative
"First time at Blossom Asian Cuisine. Came here based in Yelp reviews. I arrived at 1:15 on a Tuesday for lunch. There were four tables still finishing up, so I got fast service. I ordered the lunch special with Kung Pao Beef and an Arizona Iced Tea for $8.15 plus tip. The meal came with choice of soup, egg roll, fried wonton plus brown rice. The egg roll and wonton came after I was halfway finished with my entree. The Kung Pao was average at best. The sauce was just lacking any flavor. Too bad. With all the sides being average except the good soup, i can't rate this any higher. The staff was engaging with the customers, which got them their second star from me. The restroom was deplorable. It smelled bad, it was out of towels and the floor was dirty. Can't recommend this to my coworkers.",negative
"Love this place, I like the dinner special for 2. Orange chicken is the best. I have yet to try all the other dishes, friendly staff",positive
"Just moved to Laveen. Needed (ok, wanted) Chinese. This place has great reviews so I drove there and got take out. The beef and broccoli dinner came with rice, noodles, an eggroll, and two crab rangoons for around $9. I found the beef and broccoli to be a little bit on the salty side but other than that everything was very good. The lady at the counter was extremely friendly and was patient while I decided on what to eat. They have a comfy little bar area where you can sit and wait for your food which was nice as well. I'll be returning.",positive
"The lunch special is great. Soup, main course, rice, spring roll, and wonton. The place is very clean and the waitresses are very friendly. Did I mention you can't beat the price! An all around excellent place to stop if you are in the area and up for some great Chinese food! Yum!",positive
"Excellent customer service! I called in an order for pick up, and the lady on the phone was very friendly. I placed a large order, which was packed and ready to go when I showed up 20 mins later. The woman who helped me (I believe she was the same one I spoke to over the phone) offered me a complimentary soda and immediately took my payment as she was assisting another gentleman simultaneously. She was personable and helpful, making sure I had a take out menu and offering to help me carry everything out to my car. The food was delicious!!! The beef skewers were tender and very tasty. Sizzling rice soup, Mongolian beef and chicken fried rice were all fresh and flavorful. My personal favorite was the sweet & sour chicken. They give you the sauce on the side so the breading never gets soggy. The chicken tasted wonderful without sauce, and once you put it all together...AMAZING! I will be back!",positive
"I came here because of the good food reviews. It tasted like they took frozen chicken and fried it and poured some sauce on it. We got the General tso s chicken and orange chicken. The ""fried "" rice tasted like white rice dabbed in watered down soy sauce. No veggies or egg in it. It wasn't good and the service sucked because the tables were not clean. They didn't even ask for a refill until it was time to pay the check. Not coming back.",negative
We live close and love the Blossom. The Wonton soup is excellent. Everything we have tried here has been very good. It is clean and the service is always great. I would recommend anyone give it a try.,positive
Food Was Excellent and As For The Service I Give Them Two Thumbs Up...Keep Doing Your Thing...Best Chinese In Arizona!!!,positive
"Me and my wife come here at least once a month. Im not a walnut fan, but you have to try the walnut shrimp. Decent size shrimps to boot. Great portions, family meals, great staff, clean restraunt. WHY ARENT YOU EATING HERE YET! Family amd kid friendly too.",positive
This place is really good. They have good lunch specials and friendly staff. There are a few other Asian places in the area but this one is by far the best.,positive
"I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Today was my first time in and got the Kung pao chicken, orange chicken, lo mein and two egg rolls let me tell you this place is good and the service was awesome just like I read in the reviews. Will defenetly be coming back. Very nice interior and comfortable seating arrangments. All employees are in uniform and very nice. been living in Phoenix for 8 months and havent been able to find a place so good until now. Defenetly going to recommend this place.",positive
"My husband and I were looking for a good Chinese place near our house so we decided to try this place. I am glad we did, it was really tasty. We ordered pork fried rice, broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken. They were all equally good. We especially loved the rice and lemon chicken. Everything was hot and fresh and authentic tasting. No fast food Chinese food here! The portions were big and the prices are very affordable. $35 for all the food we got plus 2 sodas. The service was great also very friendly. We will definitely be repeat customers.",positive
Have been going here for 4 years since I bought a house in Tolleson and have never had any issues with anything I've ever ordered. Tammy is the best and has even given suggestions on different ways to spice up regular dishes on many occasions. My favorite is the house chow fun noodles cooked in chili sauce. Definitely worth checking out!,positive
"We called late on Xmas eve and they were going to close early, but thank goodness they were able to accommodate us. They were more than happy to have our take-out order ready, and fast. Everything was great and the family was impressed. We especially liked the Kung Pao Chicken. Also ordered the Jalepeno Chicken Wings (just ok, a little overcooked), Potstickers (good), and Orange Chicken (yum). Also included in our order were egg rolls (good, would have been perfect if not a little overcooked), fried rice (so-so), steamed rice (fine), and two fried shrimp (yum). Definitely give them a try!",positive
"I love this place, the food is fresh and authentic. The gals that run the floor are the sweetest, friendly, and helpful. They always make sure that you are completely satisfied when you're dining in or even taking out. My favorites are hot and sour soup, singaporean mai fun, sesame chicken, garlic beef, twice cooked pork, their crispy and spicy garlic shrimp I believe it's called off of the house specials is really good too. Their fried rice is steaming hot and is not too oily/greasy. The portions are fairly big for the price you pay, plus they use fresh, never frozen ingredients. So you pay for the quality of the food as well.",positive
"I am a big fan of this place. They get it right. Great food, great service, and great prices. Food is always hot and crispy. Server is always nice and helpful.",positive
Blossom Asian Cuisine is one of my best Chinese Food in town. The price ranges for their food are phenomenon because is very inexpensive. Their service has always been amazing. I would highly recommend this Chinese restaurant for good quality of food (plenty of food) and their reasonable prices.,positive
"Popped in for a quick lunch and was expecting nothing much. We got amazing service and wonderfully flavorful food. I will say, as someone that lived in China for a summer, I am pretty critical when it comes to Chinese food. This food is definitely Americanized but it hit the spot like nobody's business. Plus, we didn't even do a happy hour or special and we still thought the food was decently priced. Maybe because we just moved from Ahwatukee we're used to being ripped off. Honestly, the front dining room is spotless and the waiters/waitresses are the most attentive (without being annoying) I've ever seen. They're great.",positive
5th time and i've been here and its the 5th time they get everything right!!! prices are great. the food is gourmet tasting and the service is on the spot!!!,positive
This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0),negative
"Blossom is a great little hole-in-the-wall place to get yummy food and friendly service. So far, I've only been there three times, but the way they remember their customers, along with their genuine kindness and helpfulness has made an impression upon me. All three times, I've had takeout. First, the walnut shrimp: breaded, deep fried, juicy shrimp in a rich, creamy sauce, with tons of glazed walnuts and fresh broccoli. The egg rolls are also satisfyingly yummy(nothing special, but good). Recently, I've been sick, and their wonton soup has been...a blessing. Seriously. A huge container costs around $5, and it's chock-full of savory pork-filled wontons, snap peas, water chestnuts, chicken, shrimp, baby corn, carrots, and onions, all swimming in a delectable broth. Wonderful on a chilly January evening :)",positive
"They are about three minutes from my house, and they have good food! I always get the sweet and sour for my hubby, he likes it. I like the orange chicken, not the best, but good! The crab puffs are good too! The lo mein is really good, especially considering it is Tolleson. Anyone who lives in the area, I recommend it when looking for a Chinese takeout fix.",positive
"I love, love, love Boston Pizza. I worked right across the street from them for years and ate there all the time. I never EVER got anything that was not delicious! But their cheese steak is hands down my favorite! Maybe a bit pricey but worth every penny. Their chicken strips are extremely good as well, and I rarely eat chicken strips. Maybe their staff could be a little friendlier but honestly....their food is what I care about. I miss them terribly, as I live in Pahrump and hardly ever get over that way, but when I am anywhere near it....that is my go to place!",positive
"Downtown? Tipsy? Need some pizza in your belly?! Boston Pizza is always there for you no matter how late you have stayed up! Great pizza, albeit a bit greasy. But sometimes greasy is exactly what you need after a long night out. ;P",positive
I have family at the hospital down the street so we decided to check this place out. The food was so good! It have a parking lot so you don't have to park in a garage and walk or anything. The only reason I took away one star is because there isn't a ton of seating. But I would definitely recommend it for their delicious food,positive
"After our favorite nearby pizza joint closed down we were on the hunt for a place that is open late, has decent prices, but most importantly good pizza. Boston Pizza totally fits the bill. Glad we found this place. Their fried mushrooms and ranch are also great and they have anchovies (eewwah...haha) which the husband loves.",positive
Okay enough pizza but I never thought I'd say this: too much cheese. They don't scrimp on oil with the food either. My pizza was on the soggy side and required several napkins to soak up the extra grease.,negative
Nice spot off the beaten path of the strip. Wings are above average. It's a dive and a ideal place for tourists who like to rub elbows with the locals. Can't comment on Pizza haven't done that yet. Definitely a place I stop in if I'm in that part of town. One more plus. If you're across the street at Dino's hanging. Tell the bartender and your set up for a barstool delivery. I've done it a couple of times. Have at it.,positive
Awful Came here as a last resort because we really wanted pizza and couldn't find anything else that was open. The service here is beyond slow. But let's get to it already then... the food is just awful ! The pizza had a very weird taste to it and none of us could finish eating it. I seriously think the cheese was bad or something because hours late ALL of us started cramping and fighting over the bathroom. Avoid avoid avoid,negative
"I absolutely love this pizza place..i love the meat lovers pizza and cheesy garlic bread, for those that like toppings they are not light handed with them..every time i come to vegas its tradition to come here and take it back to whatever hotel i stay at...if you dont like it thats fine everyone can have their opinion, but it makes me smile everytime...so thank you boston pizza :)",positive
"So I ordered some food, they delivered the wrong food. When I called to let them know the lady I spoke to questioned my intelligence of knowing what cheese looks like. How are you going to question if I know what cheese looks like. Will never order from them again and I will let every person that works in my building know never to eat there either. Why is good customer service so hard to find!!!",negative
This place says it's Boston pizza but it's NOT the worst pizza ever had oily soggy and has no taste at all would NOT recommend this place to anyone at all find somewhere else to spend your money on,negative
Love this place have been coming here for 5 years already and will always be coming back. Great portions and great food. Always wonderful cuatomer service,positive
Kept on hold for 10 minutes and never placed my order. But first asked if I was placing for delivery or pick-up. If I would've said delivery maybe I wouldn't have been placed on never ending hold.,negative
Great service and great pizza I love the bread it's really good. I made the mistake to call dominos pizza couse I had a special on the mail for a large 14$ pizza I was on the phone for about 45 minutes I never had that happen before I thought it was a joke I was so mad and hungry at that point that I was willing to wait till someone answer so I can bitch them out lol well someone did and guess what they told me sorry we are closed hahahahahhahaa any ways thanks again Boston pizza for being there for me I will never try to cheat on you again !!,positive
"This was by far the worst pizza and worst service I have ever had from a pizza place. We were told that our order would take 15 minutes, an hour and a half later we got pizza that was so hard it literally cracked the box when we threw it back in. The delivery man was super rude. When he finally found our hotel he blamed the wait on us. I would have been okay with his attitude if it was at least good pizza. I didn't know it was possible for to make bad pizza until I ate Bostons pizza.",negative
"Just ordered delivery for the first time. Great experience all around. Elaina was super friendly taking my order, and everything arrived hot and tasty in less than 45 minutes. The pepper cheesesteak was awesome, and the hoagie roll was perfectly fresh. This will fast become my go-to delivery option for pizza and Phillies!",positive
"This place has really gone downhill. I used to love this place but recently the prices have gone up while the quality has gone down. I got a small Boston special, a pizza with everything. It's pretty filling and good. I guess I should just stick to ordering that in the future. I also got the chicken fingers, ugh, so bad. They were flat wafers of what's supposed to be chicken. How is it that it's almost $10 for chicken fingers with fries and there aren't decent sized pieces of chicken? What you get are flat, over-cooked, dry, salty, over battered, over priced, unappealing ""chicken."" So disappointing.",negative
"The food is actually pretty good. Never had their pizza, but their sandwiches are delicious. The service is pretty fast. Usually the older gentlemen that takes orders over the phone is a pleasure to talk to, but the young kid needs an attitude adjustment.",negative
"Fastest Delivery I've ever had! 20minutes after I called in my order, it was at my doorstep, fresh, hot and yummy! The double cheeseburger was very tasty and quite large. The chicken fingers and fries were moist and just the right amount hot sauce. Also ordered the greek salad, but I'm too full to eat! Will save for later, but it sure looks delicious. Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area! Its worth it! I will definitely keep their number on my 'favorites' list",positive
"Ordered wings and pizza for delivery. They got busy. Pizza arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but it and the wings & onion rings were all cold. I called and they offered to make it fresh again. I think a lot of the negative reviews about customer service are simply written by impolite people. You don't have to have worked in food services to understand that things happen. It takes a good business and quality employees to make me write anything on yelp. One could be angry that they were delivered cold food or they could not just assume that the workers didn't give a ****. What if the customer really just wants to eat regardless of temp and would be more pissed at you making things fresh and taking longer than just delivering things at room temp? Sure, they could call and check but then they're admitting fault and taking time on an order that should already be set while dealing with a large wave of customers. Every impatient person is already irritated. Every patient customer feels taken advantage of. The RIGHT way to do customer service in this situation was to do exactly as they did. Deliver as soon as they can and if the food isn't up to par, making good on your purchase by offering fresh food or your money back and an apology. Realistic people really can't ask for more without asking for too much. All the rest of you should chill.",positive
"Straight up pizza joint. ""The old man"" from Pawn Stars has advertised their wings on the show many times. I can't attest for the wings but I can tell ya that the spinach pizza w/feta cheese is a good tangy cheesy and standard fare choice. My fellow diners had the meaty one and they seemed to approve as well. Get them while they're hot. As we pulled in a local vagrant was giving me the stink-eye all the way through to the parking lot. I give charity to these citizens by not making it a brawling scuffle, because well.. Other than that the pies are good & greasy. Some people don't like that. I do.",negative
Big shout out to Boston Pizza!! Eleni and has a kick ass crew. The Best Pizza specials and the wings are the best. My partner and I work for the RTC and we visit frequently for the Outstanding food. Again those killer wings and the best ranch.. We will see you soon Eleni.. Go Steelers.. Thanks Tony,positive
This place is NOT what the reviews make it out to be at all! Pizza is too greasy . I ordered chicken wings (10) sauce was on the side and in a little container I used it all up with TWO chicken wings come on now!!! (Picture of sauce attached) The guy on the line seemed so blaaah not pleased at all that I was placing an order.,negative
"If there was a negative to this review, this place would have it. This review is for the customer service experience. First of all, the business is in LAS VEGAS so don't be surprise if someone gives you an out of state phone number. Second of all, what does that mean ""i don't know where that is"" when i give you an address. How about a GPS?? Third, I called to make a delivery order and instead of telling us they don't deliver to the area i was renting at, the worker rudely laughed and hung up. TWICE. Now, i don't care how good your food is and how many good reviews you got but you should have some respect for your customer if you're a true business owner. Enough said!",negative
"Wow...staying at a hotel near the convention center - just a couple of miles away. Called for chicken fingers and fries at 1:29 PM - not exactly the busiest hour of the day. Order taker said 40-45 minutes. That should have been my first clue. Called at 50 minutes and they said he was just down the street. Called at an hour and they said 3-4 minutes tops. At an hour and 10 minutes they promised to refund my money (in approximately 5 business days). Still no food. At 2:48 the driver called - from the wrong hotel - said he was right out front. I said ""no you're not since I'm standing outside and you're not here."" Food handed over at 2:52...a full 1:23 minutes after I called in the order. Food is COMPLETELY cold. And it's too bad...actually looks like it might be pretty good. We'll see when we put it in the microwave after we get back 'cause we have to get over to the convention center. Yeah. Chicken fingers & fries...one hour and twenty-three minutes. ========== Update: After getting back from a basketball game and some vicious microwaving, our food was actually very good. So if you know you're going to be hungry for some great food in about two hours, please, call Boston Pizza. My rating has went from one to two stars.",negative
"This is the only place we order pizza from if we are too lazy to cook. Their pizza is fantastic. Their delivery is super fast (except late at night, but that's understandable). Their prices are pretty cheap as well. Love it!",positive
"I love this place because they deliver or I can dine in when I need to escape. The menu is huge. And there are daily lunch specials. I will say that if you are going to order delivery (do it around 11:15 or your lunch might not come until after 1:00 p.m.). The prices are pretty reasonable. The staff inside the restaurant have been there forever. It is a little dingy inside, but the food is good. I am a fan of their 6"" inch pizza special. I am also having a love affair with their French fries. I don't know what they do to make the fries so good (I think there might be crack in them)...but man they are tasty.",positive
"Pros: Manager did everything she could do make me happy. I ordered a pizza for delivery to my hotel on my trip to Vegas. It was with out a doubt the worst pizza I have ever tried. The cheese didn't taste right, the crust was like a soggy bread. I literally could not eat one slice and pizza is my favorite food. My thinking has always been that there is no such thing as a terrible pizza. So I called to tell them and the manager was great. She said to pick something else and they would bring it by. I chose the chicken parm grinder and that was also way below standard. I squeezed the chicken and a lot of bad looking oil came oozing out. The roll was pretty good. I ended up just eating that. Maybe they were having a bad day but based on my experience, beware! Pizza 0/10 Chicken Parm 2/10 Fries 3/10 Delivery speed 4/10 Manager 10/10 -thanks for trying",negative
"Best fingers, best ranch, best phillies, and awesome meatball subs!! Not just in town, but EVER!! Food is great and the location makes it easy to grab a bite without being too far from a good night out on the town!! LOVE IT!!",positive
"A guy from a liquor store recommended this place to me a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been to this place every time I'm in Vegas. I've only tried the pizza & wings. Both are GREAT for those late night drunken munchies! Right down the street from the Stratosphere. You can easily tell that this is where the locals go for pizza.",positive
"Our favorite place to go for pizza and wings when we're in Vegas and in the mood for fast food to pig out. I wouldn't recommend this place if ambiance is more important than the food. Me, I prefer tasty food over ambiance. I haven't tried their other offerings, but their pizzas are as good as any best places I have been to in Chicago or California. If you like Boston style pizza with crispy crust and a lots of cheese, then you will definitely enjoy this place. This isn't your typical cheese deprived pizza from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. I hate places that skimp on their cheese and you have to order extra cheese just to get some decent amount. I am willing to pay the extra few bucks to get a quality pizza. Also, their wings are perfectly cooked to order. A large three topping pizza, 13 wings w/ fries, and a couple of drinks will cost you about $30 before tax.",positive
"Not a bad place for a burger and fries, but if you get the seared tuna wrap, don't expect for it to be seared. With the wrap, expect a fully cooked piece of tuna.",negative
"They only get one star and that's for the staff. Everything was awful. It took about 20 mins to get our food and when we did it was barely warm, the fries were cold and soggy and they charged extra for a side of honey mustard. Like pretty much place on Montford, the parking sucks.",negative
"They have the best red bull specials on Monday night. Sung is the coolest person up there, well Trevor kinda cool too. Ok I love waffles bye",positive
"I have to admit this is a pretty chill place. We came here not really knowing what to expect but it's really hipster and reminds me of other places we like to go. It was a cloudy day and it started to rain outside, people who were eating kind of just got stuck out there, I'm sure that sucked. We ordered a round of shots and it came in little plastic cups, I guess it's more efficient, just seemed a little off putting. I can see this place getting crowded fast. But, I'd definitely come back.",positive
"I was in town for the week and stopped in for a quick bite to eat. They had me at, ""Hello."" Brazwells is ME: from the decor to the energy; food offerings to the actual taste; cleanliness to the en pointe service. I loved it. Our bartender Kelsey was so helpful in deciding what eat/drink. She was very informative and so much fun! We had such a lovely experience that we had to go back one more time before we left NC!! Will definitely be back on my next visit!",positive
"Great food, awesome atmosphere! My girlfriends and I came here for the first time on a Friday. We ordered the spinach dip which was delicious and $3 Sangrias! They do not cut corners on their sangrias - we were wine drunk by the end of the night lol. Each of us ordered something different. I ordered the Smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries. Aaah! So damn good! The fries have a brown sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on it which gives it a wonderful sweet taste. The burger was over cooked than what I originally asked (well done vs. medium well) but it was still good and juicy.",positive
"I give them 2 stars, simply for putting up with my drunk friend wobbling around(Not loud or anything) and not kicking us out. Other than that, this place was a fail. Service was super slow, our waitress forgot to put our order in, then when she did, everything was wrong! Most of our order was pretty much someone else's when it came out because it was so wrong. I was not impressed with my steak. It was explained to be marinated with Teriyaki with island spices and flavors with pineapples. The Steak had no flavor. Maybe they tried to cook it in Teriyaki last minute and the sauce just burned off? I don't know, but it was definitely not marinated as described. I definitely would not return for the food.",negative
"Salmon BLT is on point. Patio is great. Service is something to be desired, so don't go if you're in a hurry. Sunday brunch is a good place to start. Can be filled with the hipster-millennial types but that's what Montford has turned in to. Give it a try.",positive
"Horrible. 5 in our party. Waitress wouldn't take all of our orders at the same time and disappeared after taking each individual order. Went to the front to get a drink, waitress with glasses was very rude. I asked for manager and she laughed and said she had no idea where he was. Never again!",negative
Great service at brazwells today. Bartender Tammy was wonderful. She serviced our whole party better than anyone ever has. Be sure to try Jaunita's special bean dip! 5 stars!!!,positive
"Staff was rude, only had 2 beers then decided to go somewhere else and heard the Bartender talking loudly to her other coworker about the ""big 2 dollar tip"" she was going to get from us. Food menu looked decent and wasn't that packed for a football Sunday which is a plus. One thing that stuck with me even after the bartender with the attitude was that we didn't get a warm welcome when you walk through the door.",negative
Staff is incredibly friendly and the wings are delicious. This is my go to spot to watch NFL games on Sunday. They also have one of the best patios on Montford.,positive
Kelsey recommended the wings with a combination dry rub and sauce. They were awesome. This bar is the best hangout in Charlotte. And Kelsey is one hell of a bartender. Great food and great drinks and atmosphere.,positive
"I have heard this is a good place to go drink at night on the weekends.... Well keep it that way!! Me and some girlfriends went out there to get a quick lunch and we had the worst experience. The waitress was the worst! It was pretty slow and It took forever for us to get menus, took 30min before she took our order, she gave us an open half empty bottle of wine and the list goes on.... Hopefully it was just the bad waitress our visit was so unpleasant.",negative
One of my fav hangouts after work. Half price apps are great. Lots to choose. Great service and beautiful people. Definitely Premo bar ! Craft beer but mostly in bottle. Few popular drafts. Outside area in back is awesome in rain or shine and they have heaters when it's cool out. Check it out !,positive
"The food was decent, but the service was subpar. We had a group of 18 people and it took over an hour to get our food orders. Then when we were ready to leave it took over 40 minutes to get our checks. The checks came out wrong and the MOD was full of excuses. The waitress was great but she needed some help. Her manager wasn't great at backing her up. Because we took so long to get serviced another groups time was pushed back.",negative
"By far the best Bloody Mary bar, I have been to in Charlotte!!!! A group of girls and I try a different place once a month for brunch. Only one of us got"" brunch food"", but she loved it. The others got wings, for football. The bloody mary bar made everything worth well.....",positive
"What the is the point of having a phone number if nobody answers it?? I called on my way here twice, and called while I was sitting at the bar and I dont hear a ringer. I just wanted to call in a late night food order so I didn't have to wait for it.",negative
I'm been going to Brazwells for a couple of years now and always get good service by the staff. The food is surprisingly good for a pub. I love the outdoor patio area when the weather is nice. Great place to watch sports.,positive
"Since my last review they have cleaned house of the rude waitresses and the staff is great now. However, management quit offering a side salad and now only offer a giant size. Managers! Please bring back the smaller side salad. It is costing you business cause now we don't order any salad. Bummer!",positive
"I really enjoyed the bar! There is a ton of eye candy walking around with their mugs of beer, and is surprisingly gay-friendly. A group of us guys went to enjoy a few drinks after dinner, and were pleasantly surprised at the chill atmosphere and wide menu of drinks!! Being a cocktail drinker and not so much of a beer person, I was skeptical at the quality of cocktail a man-bar may create. However, when I ordered, the waitress said that my drink was REALLY good and her favorite but the bartenders hated making it because all the girls who came in ordered it. Haha. I knew this was the drink for me after that remark! And, it arrived in all it's Strawberry Sangria glory and was DELICIOUS!! The boys with me enjoyed their brews and a great time was had by all. There were plenty of TVs to watch sporting events, if that was something we were interested in. Great time, great bar, great night!",positive
"I have only come here at night so I only know how the nightlife is, no idea what the food is like. The back patio is really nice on summer nights, it does get packed so if you want to get a table I suggest coming early. They have the usual drinks and there are a few bars in the restaurant. One side and 2 outside so it is pretty easy to get drinks. They play great music and they have TVs outside so you can catch any game you want. The service has been great both times I went. I would definitely suggest this place to come when you want a simi-chill night with friends!",positive
The name says it! This place really has a pub atmosphere but premium food. I love coming here late night for the more booze oriented pub feel on the huge outdoor deck. Just came in for dinner before the night crowd blew up and ordered a blackened salmon. It was prepared perfectly. The rice was lacking but the veggies were cooked very well. The staff was very welcoming and Kelly behind the bar was awesome. This just became my favorite place on Montford in Charlotte!,positive
"Awesome burgers and outdoor patio seating! Great drink specials! Try the pimento cheese burger, it rocks!! Parking can be an issue.",positive
"Since I work right beside Montford this is in my weekly rotation of lunch spots. The food is great, service is friendly, and the back patio is awesome. Always end up ordering a beer and the Western Burger. Never disappointed! Haven't been here for dinner, but I hear it gets quite busy.",positive
"I have been back a few times since my last review. I want to love this place, and I do find myself coming back. However, the service has been pretty bad lately. Recently, my friends and I came by for a beer, but decided to eat in. We let the hostess know this and she brought us menus. Then, we waited. Over the course of 35 minutes, we tried flagging down a few waitresses, but they were ignoring us. One waitress in particular was spending all her time and one table. That table sat down when we did and had their appetizers and full meals out before we ever even got a drink order in! I finally went to the bar and asked if we could possibly get a server. The girl who eventually helped us did a decent job, but we waited so long to order that only one of my friends ate. Everyone was pissed, and I really can't blame them. Overall, we were there almost an hour and a half just to get our meals and everything. I like the casual vibe and it is a decent spot to watch a game, but it's definitely not the place for decent customer service. My advice? Just come for the beer and order at the bar.",negative
"Great place to watch a game. On Sundays they have a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar which is outstanding. They are also cheap-- $4 (I think) and also have a Mimosa special. I have not eaten a meal here. I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food. It was all fine. My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%. The service here has never been good. The location works. The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun. This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat. And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found. Maybe I am just disgruntled. I miss the Press box being here...",negative
"It take a lot for me to really go off on a place. A LOT. But Brazewells has earned my displeasure. Let me start with at least one positive. Kelly, behind the bar, is awesome. She's friendly and knows her stuff. And that, my fellow yelpers, is where the redeeming qualities end. Rarely have I been where the waitstaff was so clueless and uncaring. ""May I see a wine list?"".. ""Oh, uhh.. well, we don't really have one right now... sorry."" *crickets* Are you kidding me? if I had been here once and heard this, I probably wouldn't mention it, but over a 3-4 month period, I heard this more than once. My other major complaint is that many of the servers are just rude. I'll grant, however, that if I had to put up with the usual crowd they draw, I may be, too. After visiting this place on a Saturday night, I knew it'd be my last visit. The back patio was WAY overcrowded and packed with self-absorbed douches. Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there. Beware, they also allow smoking back there. Just.. eww! As we were trying to leave, I had people actually refuse to move so that I could step down off the patio. Seriously?? Why are there bouncers here? All they did was watch as I struggled to navigate the insanity. Skip this drunk and douche infested place and walk across the street to Ten Park Lanes, instead. You deserve better.",negative
"Great place for Happy Hour! We typically go here either to start or end the night, and it can get pretty packed. Cornhole on the deck is clutch, and this place is the best for watching NFL games. They have a bloody mary bar on Sundays and tons of TV's. Never a problem watching the games here.",positive
"Went for the first time last week. Great patio. As far as food, only had nachos. Wow I cant believe restaurants use cheese wiz. Come on lets use some real cheese please !",negative
Moved to Allentown recently and so glad we found Breakfast at Shelly's. Every time we come here the food and service is always excellent. And such low prices. Only takes cash. But with such low prices it's not an issue at all. Have tried many different items off the menu and everything is delicious.,positive
"The atmosphere is retro-darling, clean and attentive. The food is great and they keep your coffee filled. Definitely worth a visit.",positive
"I tried this place today and wasn't sure how it was gonna be but glad I did, this place isn't anything fancy or even true to be its a nice little diner with a nice full deli, nice to see small businesses in the area and seems to do very well. I had the breakfast burrito with a choice of meat inside it was huge, very good. Nice service and I will definitely return to try other items so hard to choose the first time there.",positive
"Shelly's is a great neighborhood diner with good, straightforward breakfast food. There's also a lunch menu, butI haven't checked it out yet. As a bonus, pick up some soup or lunchmeat on your way out at the deli!",positive
"Terrible, ordered this off of grub hub and ordered the protein packer and calis breakfast sandwich. Calis sandwich was not a sandwich they just threw all the ingredients into the box. The protein packed had barely any chicken and was very small for the price. Would not order from here again. I could have made this better.",negative
"Scenario: you woke up, belly's rumblin', your fridge is empty and cupboard is out of coffee. You really only have one choice, Shelly's. Best breakfast in the city, situated in historic Allentown. But don't take my word for it, try it yourself and become a believer.",positive
The breakfast was excellent. My cheese omelette was done just right and everything else was quite pleasantly satisfying to my tastebuds :),positive
"My husband and I quickly became regulars at this joint. I think we've had most of the items on the menu. Being a breakfast and lunch diner, they became a weekend destination. It has a very friendly atmosphere and normally has something funny on the board outside. There is normally a ton of parking on the street and if there is not, there is a parking lot a block or so down. That area of the city is quickly changing with some little stores so go have some breakfast or lunch and walk around a bit. Remember, they are cash only still.",positive
When I walked into this place I thought I was sent back in time. It reminded me of all the small luncheonettes and diners I remembered growing up in N.Y. (only bigger). I wound up owning my own luncheonette for 9.5 years. The breakfast my family and I had was wonderful. Fresh ground Columbian coffee was a nice start. All the eggs and omelets we had were cooked just the way we asked for them. Very nice portions and the waitress was AWESOME. Every time I go back to Pitt this will be my breakfast spot.,positive
"I came here with a few friends for breakfast on a Friday and though it's not in the most ""tourist-y"" area, it was a pleasant experience! We seated ourselves and were greeted immediately. Our drinks were brought to us in a timely manner and shortly after ordering, our delicious breakfast arrived! I personally think you can never go wrong with breakfast because it's the most important and BEST meal of the day.. Anyway, the food was delicious. Tasted fresh and we were served pretty big portions! You definitely get bang for your buck here. There was parking along the street outside. They accept cash only though! There's an ATM inside but make sure you bring some cash so you don't get charged the service fee.",positive
Attempted to order takeout today at 2:40 and was told they were closed after walking in the front door. The door was unlocked and the sign on the door says they close at 3:00pm. Will not be coming back here since they do not want the business.,negative
"Great diner! Food tastes fresh and portions are large. They have a basic breakfast and lunch menu that they do very well (instead of a huge menu where everything is so-so), but the gold star goes to their breakfast burritos. Huge and packed with good stuff! Prices are very reasonable and staff is friendly, but not hovering. It's never been super-busy when we've been there. It looks like they've made some improvements to the dining area since last time we were in - it seemed a lot brighter. The neighborhood is undergoing a bit of revitalization, but don't let that keep you away. It's just a few minutes off Route 51 or Arlington Ave and located on a main road. Parking is very close and easy on the side streets. There's a good mix of locals, but you don't get that ""outsider"" feeling. Really hope this place stays around for awhile.",positive
"The food was bad. The restaurant was cold. The wait was long. We arrived at about 11:00am on a Thursday. There were 2 other people there who had walked in moment before us. My fiancée ordered a waffle and one egg scrambled. I ordered their Special #2 ( 2 eggs over easy; home fries; bacon; toast). It took about 25 minutes to get our food.The waffle was burnt on the bottom. Like literally black, no exaggeration. The top wasn't burnt it was sprinkled with powdered sugar and looked amazing. But he took a bite and it tasted like it was burnt and it was...SMH. Like why would you still serve this, just remake it. The egg was subpar. My eggs over easy cake out over cooked, not even eggs over medium consistency like completely cooked through..SMH. The bacon was good (you can't really mess up bacon..IJS). The home fries not good at all. Maybe this is a Pittsburgh dish and it's an acquired taste but if not then these were just down right nasty. Then to top it all off I threw up after eating the edibles parts of this dish. Eat at your own risk. There was quite a bit of traffic around 12 so maybe this is an acquired taste but me and my Midwest- tastebuds do not agree with this place. The one star is for the easy parking and the cheap prices (13 bucks for everything listed above).",negative
"Don't let the location discourage you, during the daytime anyways. :) Does very well for all of your standard diner fare, not anything as far as especially appetizing ingredients at least on the breakfast items.",negative
"We came for a late lunch in a Saturday. It was recommended to me by the barista at Black Forge Coffee, who is also a server at Shellys. The building has a great feel, definitely not fancy, but very comfortable and clean. All of our food was very good, and fairly priced. We will be returning here.",positive
"Went there last week with a friend and was at first wondering if the place was open.i guess they're still finding they're place.the service was great,very friendly waitresses who told us it was pretty much a family affair as far as the workers.i ordered a burger which was the special for 7.00.My burger was great,juicy and seven on what they call a Dutch roll (I think)to me it was a cibatta bread roll and was great.Fresh cut fries were ok.My friend had a steak hoagie and fries,he said was excellent.i couldn't believe the place was empty.Someone did pickup a to go order and didn't bother to tip by the way.I suggested they maybe open earlier for breakfast and promote to the potential customers at the nearby police station and port authority garage.I will go back soon and often",positive
"In the era of unique burger chains that have been popping up all over town, this place is one of the best. As someone who loves burgers, mexican food, and spicy foods, their Arizona style burger with green chile beef on top of the burger patty is incredible. I added pepper jack cheese and topped it with lettuce and Cholula hot sauce. What resulted was a fiery yet delicious burger that was entirely unique in flavor and ingredients. With so many burger joints around, it's hard to find such a uniqueness anymore, but Bueno Burger delivers. I highly recommend it.",positive
"Dear Bueno Burger, I love you. Maybe that's a bit forward after my first visit today, but I do and I can't be ashamed to hide my love for you. From your mesquite grill, to your pickled jalapenos, to the fresh guacamole on top of my perfectly cooked bueno style burger, I find you remarkably attractive. Your french fries were hot, fresh, and perfectly made. Your onion rings were tasty and not too breaded. Your store is clean, neat, and brightly lit with it's beautiful modern booths and tables. Your fountain drinks were typical but well stocked. Your staff is friendly, polite, and helpful to a new-comer like me. My dear sweet Bueno Burger, I'll try not to be too overbearing with my visits because you are kind of a far drive from my house but you are oh so worth the trip and worth spending my weight watchers points on any day of the week. Until we meet again..... Faithfully yours, Beth S.",positive
"My girlfriend lives by here and I drive by this place literally everyday on my way home. So we were thinking of grabbing burgers from another place when we saw that it was closed. I took out my phone and pulled up Yelp to see what was around. Saw the reviews and said ""Hey lets try Bueno Burger"" Sounds good! they all said. We walk in and the small of mesquite smacks you in the face.. Dammnn.. it smelled amazing. We ordered a bunch of burgers with fries. Near the end my girlfriend noticed that they had sweet potato fries and asked if it was too late. Not only did they make a fresh batch for her, but they also threw in the reg fries that were done too. Here's a cool thing.. on Sundays if you order an entree, you get a free brownie.. we walked away with four. :) After getting home, I bit into the burger and was pleasantly surprised at the taste. The mushrooms, bacon, sauce.. the flavors were all over. I really cant wait to go back here, it was that good. So glad we tried this place and so glad it's close too!",positive
"All burgers are delicious. Get a hot dog, Bueno style to go with it; so good, you can't pass it up. Sweet potato fries are no extra charge. Also, the mesquite smell will intensify your appetite, so be ready to eat.",positive
"I really liked the atmosphere in this place, plus they had a great football game while we ate, but the overall burger experience was ok. It was like a mexican version of smash burger. Long wait time, GREAT smell. I would have liked more smokey flavor in the actual burger, but all in all it was really good. Oh, and I recommend a crap load of napkins because it's ridiculously messy.",positive
"Second time visiting this burger joint, I do have to say I really like this place the burgers rock! They are real juicy burgers. You will definately walk out of there full and happy. They have burritos and bowls too,but I just can't get past the burgers. Its always clean and the workers are always nice and helpful. They never look to busy though, hope they stick around.",negative
"The smell alone deserves a 5 star rating. Just finished up my free bueno birthday meal and it was Yummy like always. Can't go wrong with the bueno style burger, lobe the jalapeno relish. My wife tried the Glendale style style today with green beef chili on the burger. Some more tasty stuff. Bueno is right up there with Lennys as the the burger of the west side",positive
"This place is really close to my husband's work. We decided to try this place for our Tuesday lunch date. While it was clean, it was nearly dead. The only people in the restaurant were there to shoot a commercial or an interview. The food, while largely portioned, was not that great. I would have much rather gone across the street to the 'Berto's. I had a chicken burro with guac while the hubs had the pulled pork upon my recommendation (I had read the reviews here about the pork being great). The chicken had a nice smoky flavor but it completely overwhelmed my burro. It was the only thing I tasted. The hubs said he had the same thing with the pork. We also had the brownies. They were the best part of the meal. Even though the food was not terrible, I had sated my curiosity about Bueno Burger and don't feel the need to return. They were trying a bit too hard to be the next Chipotle. Why does every new restaurant now need to have a minimum of 3 TVs all playing sports review shows? Very distracting. Definitely not a recommend.",negative
"I rarely go to the west side of town and I was in the area looking for a Subway when I realized that apparently the closest was 4 miles away. Thanks to my Iphone's hint, I realized I was just minutes away from Bueno Burger which one of my friends keeps on mentioning. I thought the look of the place was nice. They only have this one location which is surprising but the decor is unique going for a little of the Chipotle look. I was greeted kindly and asked for a suggestion having never been there. Ordered the Arizona Style burger,$5.95, (green chili beef, roasted green chilis, lettuce and sour cream) and added guacamole,tomatoes and cheddar cheese to give it a little extra something. I'm pretty bland when it comes to anything spicy and was a bit worried about the kick but it wasn't ""too bad"". Too bad meaning I didn't sweat from it but it was hot enough to give me hiccups. Still even though it got a little messy because of the sour cream and guacamole I thought the concept and quality was very good. I don't know if I'd venture all the way out here just for Bueno Burger but if you live close by it's definitely a unique concept and compared to what other reviewers have said I thought it was fairly priced for a burger,drink and fries when compared to In-n-out for example.",positive
"I came here and got the carne asada burrito. It said that it cames with beans and rice, I didn't know they meant INSIDE the burrito. I thought that was on the side. Oh well. It was still pretty good. Reminded me a LOT of Chiptole. The flavor, ingredients, even the building was remeniscent of Chipotle. I haven't tried the burgers yet but I would like to at some point. I would say if you like Chipotle you will probably enjoy the food here.",positive
"I've been here several times, both dining in and taking out. I've never had a bad experience and have never disliked anything I ordered. Staff is friendly, music is rockin and upbeat. Food is really good. My only bummer was not being able to have a Mexican Coke earlier because they were sold out. Otherwise...Bueno for Bueno Burger!",positive
"We came here after enjoying a delicious pulled pork sandwich at taste of Glendale. Unfortunately, they were out of the pulled pork:( We decided on a chicken sandwich and Sonoran dog along with some onion rings. The onion rings were delicious!! The hot dog and the chicken sandwich had a great flavor. The only issue was that the chicken was somewhat dry. The wifi did not work and no one knew anything about it. Overall it had a nice ambience and we would definitely come again. Maybe next time we will get to have the pulled pork sandwich.",positive
"Yum! We were first introduced to Bueno Burger at The Taste of Glendale. There they served a pulled pork sandwich that stuck in my memory and today I just had to taste it again. When we arrived I got a little worried because I did not see a pulled pork sandwich on the menu board but to my relief I saw it on a paper menu with ""seasonal item"" written below it. I asked and sure enough they were able to satisfy my craving. Pulled pork in a mild bbq sauce with cilantro slaw on top. typically I am not a major slaw fan, but the seasoning in this one is a perfect addition to the sandwich. It was as good as I remembered and I can only hope that next time we go back it will be in ""season."" The husband had a burger ""Glendale Style"" which had bacon, mushrooms, horseradish sauce, and swiss cheese. For under 20 bucks we were both stuffed and satisfied walking out the door and felt it was overall a pleasant experience. We will be back :)",positive
"I had a Groupon for this place (how many reviews lately have started with that? :-)). Before I buy a Groupon I use Yelp to get a feel if I really want to try a place. I bought a Gringo style burger with sweet potato fries and an iced tea. They were all OK. The sweet potato fries were not as crispy as I would like but they are not bad. Because it is a new, off menu, item they asked me how I liked them and although they were not the best I have had they were not far enough off I could say exactly why. They could have used a dipping sauce other than ketchup. I liked the burger. There is nothing great about any of the food but it is reasonably priced and OK. The service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you. They are obviously passionate about their restaurant as how many cooks in a fast food place come out and tour the dining room to check on their customers? They have a frequent diner program that is web based which is sort of cool. Given I have to drive past this place for either In-and -Out or Culvers I will more often than not stop at this local place to eat rather than the chains. There is a larger parking lot on the South of this small strip mall and if it fills up there is also the large Target parking lot.",negative
"One of the gals I work with had a horrible experience with the employees here when they first opened, so I was immediately turned off. I, however, still wanted to try it out because it's near home and I love hot dogs. I figured I'd wait a while for the bugs and bad employees to be worked out, as all new restaurants need, before I made my visit. A Groupon became available so I used that opportunity to try out their food at half price and would be easier to look past any bad customer service that I may encounter. The woman working there was very friendly and helpful, so good for them they seemed to have fixed the customer service issues. I got a hot dog and selected my own toppings rather than choosing one of their topping styles on the menu. I also ordered onion rings and a fountain drink. My Groupon was for $10 and I used all but a few cents of it. I didn't think twice about it since I've been known to drop 8 bucks on a dog at the ballpark, until I got home to eat and realized the dog was smaller than the ones offered by Circle K. Yikes! 9 dollars for a Little Slugger with cheese and bacon on it?? The onion rings were very delicious. Worth $5? Negative. The food was good, but overpriced for the amount received. If the dog was Dback dog sized and I received the same amount of rings as one would at a restaurant as an appetizer, then I think the $10 would be a fair price for the food. It's been 2 months since my visit and I have yet to return although I have been in that shopping center countless times. Hopefully the other items are larger than the hot dog. I'm sure one of these days I'll try again because the food, although small, was tasty.",negative
"I love this place. First of they get social media and how to reward loyal customers. I know that doesn't tell you about the food but it does say something about how they care about customers and their willingness to listen. Let me give an example. Shortly after they opened I commented that I would like to have had a chicken option for a quesidilla they thanked me for my comment. Within a month there were chicken options on the menu. Now that could have been something in the works but asking for comments, reacting to my comment, and doing something went a long way. On to the food. Love the burgers. All of the ingredients taste so fresh. I have brought a lot of people here to try it and that is something that is always commented on. Everyone says they can taste the freshness. My other absolute must have are the chips and salsa. I love the salsa and can't get enough. I have seen them continue to evolve from the beginning and really like everything they are doing. I highly recommend.",positive
"My husband and I went here yesterday for our first and only time. To start, the place reminded me Chipotle or Qdoba, but not. It seemed to have some type of structural problem. In the middle of the dining area there was a section blocked off. I ordered the bean(pinto) and cheese burrito combo(drink &fries) and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito combo. We never got a receipt, that is my #1 pet peeve when it comes to fast food dining. I have been overcharged at many ""berto""s style restraunts in the past. They have a skimpy selection of soft drinks and the condiment/ drink area looked kind of sloppy. There were no forks, no black pepper and the knives were all sitting ""blade"" up, which is kinda gross. Our burritos came in baskets, the amount of french fries was equivelent to what you would get with a child's meal @ McD's, dissapointing. The tortillas were dry and flaky. My beans were whole, unmashed, and pretty watery, so it was hard to taste the cheese. I was told upon ordering my burrito came with pico and sour cream which was not in my burro when I got it. My husband's burrito came with black beans, mushy white rice, pico, sour cream, and of course carne. He said it was flavorless and had to add hot sauce for flavor. We decided then the place sucked and we wouldn't return. Then it got worse... We both got sick about 6 hours later. To keep it vague, intense lower GI issues. NOT pleasant. **UPDATE- exactly one day after my review, Nov 23rd, I received this message ""Hello, We are so sorry for you terrible experience. It's not what we are committed to. Not at all. I realize you didn't get a receipt, but if you remember the approximate cost of your meal, we will send you a check to refund your money. Thanks, Vanessa Shaw, the Owner"" I sent Vanessa my address that same day and have yet to receive a check from Bueno Burger. AGAIN, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! WHY DID SHE EVEN CONTACT ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?",negative
"My second visit and it will probably will be my last. Had a Bueno Burger bueno style and a Bueno Dog bueno style. The condiments were ok, but way to much it made my burger and dog colder than the condiments it really made me feel like the meat was not cooked and the burger tasted like they dumped a bottle of liquid smoke on it. We will find out if I get a bueno case of Montezuma's Revenge later.",negative
"Much, much better than when I last ate here. So excited because the burger tasted great! Love their Bueno sauce and their fresh green chilis. This place has improved a lot and I am now a happy customer!",positive
"After the first trip I returned two more times with my young son after a particularly bad first impression. Two burgers. One Arizona style This is not one to take away, the amount of sour cream was excessive and dragged down the temperature of an already struggling patty. It was edible and cooked this time. Green chili had a nice taste on the isolated bit that wasn't drowning in sour cream and I would probably like it in a burrito. Onion rings also had heat in them too. One Bueno style. Same issue one small piece of meat trying to support all the ingredients that have cooled it down prior to getting the table. Still slow service, still had a construction area in the middle of it . It's just not doing it for me at $6 for a thin burger drowned out by the toppings. 2.5 rounded to 2.",negative
Different I'll give you that but quite costly for such a small burger. The AZ Burger with cheese alone cost me $6.50. To be honest I thought it was a lil on the bland side. Combo(+1.95) came with a drink and a bunch of somewhat undercooked small cut fries. Probably won't be dining back here.,negative
"The food is still decent but this place is going downhill fast. Today is my 5th visit in the 6 months since they opened and the place is in disrepair, literally! There is scaffolding in the middle of the dining area holding up a broken roof truss. They had most tables full but the rest had discarded foodservice items piled on them and there were fries and soda all over the floor by the tables. The soda counter was filthy and a sticky mess and I truly felt bad for the elderly couple I saw clean their own table off when they realized none of the staff would. I really want this place and other small local restaurants to survive, but I don't think I'll risk being crushed by falling roof beams for the food again. **Update, got a message from Vanessa, who says she is one of the owners*** She expressed concern about the cleanliness, and commented that the scaffolding was temporary while the sort things out with a contractor. What upsets me, and made me add this update is the comment she made to me about not appreciating my review (which was written from my actual experience). Sorry business owners, if you can't take candor from your patrons on a public forum, you're in the wrong business. A negative review hurts your business less than allowing the negative experience that spurned the review in the first place! Also, the part about being crushed by a falling roof beams was intended as humor, not an actual expression of fear of injury. I know nobody would be dumb enough in our litigious society to allow people in an unsafe facility.",negative
"For someone who loves Chipotle and Pei Wei style places this is pretty similar in atmosphere and just like Chipotle and Pei Wei, it's just a step up from fast food but below sit-down restaurant. The food was pretty good. The guacamole on the burger was very fresh and it had green onion. I can't wait to go back to try a burrito or a Nogales dog! Our meal: 1 Burger w/guacamole and onion 1 Double burger with bacon and jalapeño relish 1 Fry 1 Onion ring 2 drinks -------- $20.50",positive
As soon as you walk in the door you notice the aroma of mesquite burning. The staff is friendly and the bueno burger is delicious. I really enjoy the jalapeño relish. The owner is on site which is nice and the concept is new. The have been open for a couple of months now and i had a great experience. I had a Sonoran dog as an appetizer and followed it up with a burger bueno style. The chef told me to try her combo and I loved it. I think it is cool that you can choose several different toppings all for the same price. Two thumbs up and I will be back.,positive
"Last night was my first visit to Bueno Burger. I'm not a huge burger fan, but after this burger, I have converted. Got the Bueno Burger with cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions and thier Bueno Sauce....yummy!. Next on the menu is the Sonoran Dog, I just hope it taste just like Guerros in Tucson, theirs is amazing.",positive
"I didn't go for the Sonoran hot dog (Guero, we need an El Guero Canelo in Phoenix, por favor!!) But did want to try this place (without reading reviews first.) It's kind of like a Chipotle meets Fuddruckers. You tell them how you want your burger/burrito/hot dog, and they bring it to you. I got the bueno burger - the actual meat is about 1/4 inch thin and they still managed to get it pink in the middle - pretty impressive. The fries were good, and my friend got the onion rings which have a sweet crispy batter. Not bad. Not fantastic, but not bad. What is bad though is that we paid 17 dollars for it. Overpriced by about four or five dollars, in my opinion. Go here if you're in the area and want a sit down burger (by the way, the barn-meets-industrial decor is odd). But don't go out of your way for it - instead, write a letter to Guero and tell him to start a third El Guero Canelo up here (near Project Challenge in Queen Creek might be a good location to start).",negative
"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I read the review on AZCentral. It looks and feels like a chipotle. I'm getting sick of that entire industrial vibe. They were out of hot dog buns and that is the whole reason I went. So I ordered a carne asada burrito. My friend ordered a bueno burger. The carne asada burro came with rice, beans, pico, and sour cream. It was smaller than a chipotle burro and not even as good. I am not a fan of chipotle to begin with so that is pretty sad. The little bit of meat in the burro was fat and chewy. I ended up spitting it on the plate. Disgusting. My buddy said his burger was a 2-3 at best. He said he was hungry and as he ate it he talked of how greasy it was and not as good as he initially thought. Very disappointed and most likely wont return. Bummer.",negative
"Went here at 1130am, so I figured they would be prepared for lunch time. I was literally the only person in the drive-thru, and it still took ten minutes to get my food. Half my fries tasted fresh and half were extremely stale. My burger was good and the woman working apologized for my wait, but definitely not worth the wait.",negative
This is the worst Burger King I have ever been to. I have gave them several chances because I realize everyone has bad days.. BUT every time I'm in here the people working are rude and uncaring when they mess my food up... I will never be going back there!!,negative
"Food here is meh. Got the 5 for &4 deal... It's nothing special. You get a bacon cheeseburger, 4 nuggets, fries, a drink, and a cookie. The cookie is the 5th item Wendy's doesn't offer (they have 4 for $4). Wendy's definitely beats them in quality and flavor. My bacon cheeseburger was sloppy and dry tasting. Fries were good. Nuggets tasted like the big cheap bag you can get at Walmart and had soggy spots.",negative
"Quite possibly the worst Burger King in town. The service is fairly average, but the food is far below average. As soon as I got home and ate my food, it tasted stale and cold.",negative
"While I typically like Burger King's burgers, the customer service at this location is a nightmare. I rarely frequent this location just because of their awful attitudes. I don't need to pay people to treat me like I'm bothering them to do their jobs.",negative
"Ordered the Chicken Alfredo for delivery. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was watery and bland. The garlic bread was good, but overall it was a waste of money. I won't be ordering again.",negative
Disgusting order last night never ordering here again wings weren't cooked all the way worst cheesecake (jack n the box tastes better),negative
"Okay so...... where to begin. We ordered delivery tonight and we'll.... kind of confused. The pizza? DELICIOUS. That being said. Ordered the deal, 15 wings, 6 fingers, two liter. The only thing that was 100% correct on the order was the soda. Their olives say (black and green). We only got black. The wings we ordered hot, came plain, ordered the fingers with parm and garlic, got 15 plain chicken wings. Yeah, we got x2 orders of 15 plain wings instead of wings and fingers. No hot or garlic parm sauce on the side, got 6 ranches. This review would be zero stars if possible EXCEPT the pizza was very good, despite the lack or proper toppings. Not sure I'd ever order delivery from here again. Would have to babysit the dense cook and QA. Decent food, slightly obtuse workers. Also here's my receipt.",negative
"I did not even want to give this place a one star. The person that answered the phone in regards to my post mates delivery about an hour ago at 3:20 AM on this Thursday/Friday morning, Is really unprofessional. I ordered post mates food and his company did not follow up with the driver or Postmates to ensure that my food got here on time. Rather he told me to call Postmates to deal with it myself. I've been ordering from Café Verdi for well over 27 years. I'm a long-time customer. But after today I am not pleased with the service, and will be taking my business elsewhere.",negative
"This was the only place that delivery up to 10pm. I was crazy to eat some Mediterranean food. The price is fare, the food is very good, delicious bread, very fresh salad, I use to go eat in some Mediterranean restaurants and they don't have fresh salad like this one. The food tastes very good. The only thing is, they should tell us at the website details about the food. I was not expecting pepper. I'm not American, I don't like pepper and this is one of the reasons why I love Mediterranean food. Usually in the Mediterranean restaurants, at least the ones I use to go, there's not spicy meat in the main menu. I didn't write a note asking for non spicy food cause I was not expecting for that but it was my bad too. Good thing is, the taste is very good so I can handle it. Everything perfect. I will definitely order again! But you guys should definitely put some more details about the food seasoning. Also the they confirmed my order only one minute after by text message and it was delivered before the time expected. Very good service! Congrats!",positive
"Ordered extra saucy wings mozzarella sticks and extras on pizza . The wings were not cooked right or saucy at all and they forgot to deliver the mozzarella sticks . Bad customer service, never again !",negative
"I'm editing my review that i wrote over a year ago (today is 3-6-18) because it seems like they've switched owners or management and now everything is completely changed for the worst. I would avoid this place. They've pretty much ruined everything good about the restaurant. The pizza crust is cracker like, the sauce now is overly seasoned with oregano, the vegetarian pizza now includes inedibly large dollops of raw garlic, the strombolis are no longer rolled which sorta makes them not calzones, the wings that arrived were under sauced and under fried. I haven't tried all the other stuff on the menu because why would I? It looks like the new owners have added a slew of Mediterranean dishes which I haven't tried. For all I know they might be good. But I was a loyal cafe verdi customer for about 9 years and now I'm regrettably going to have to walk away :( Cafe Verdi I will miss you. You were there for me on so many later nights. RIP",negative
Ordered 2x gyros and a combo appetizers via grubhub Was delivered in a timely manner. Left nice tip Gyro meat was very very thin and very very dry. It was like pita bread stuffed with Iceberg lettuce and jerky. Inedible. Appetizer platter was a bunch of fried stuff and came out about as one would expect. Portions of marinara were fine but single container of ranch was half filled which kinda sucks.,negative
This place is amazing. The cook during lunch is always on point with getting the orders right. The front of house staff can be hit or miss with good service depending who's working. I order here for my work about 2-3 times a month and almost never have in issue with the food. The owner is a friendly person who I often see helping is staff and keeping the ball rolling. Thanks again!,positive
"So it was late at night my fiancé and I were hungry so we came across this restaurant, he ordered the gyro with fries and I ordered mozzarella sticks and onion rings, tho it came within the time frame the gyro had razor thin slices of meat and he was only given a small handful of fries mind you his alone was 9.99. My mozzarella sticks were fine but my onion rings literally had NO onions in them at all it was just breading, I thought maybe it was just a few but every single one had no onion at all. Our total was just under $30. Quite the rip off of you ask me and I've never been so dissatisfied with food I've ordered from any restaurant in Vegas.",negative
Horrible service!!! I came in for a pick up and the cashier just stayed looking at me while having a full conversation on the phone and not one time asked to help me with anything.,negative
We order from here at least once a week. Their calzones are so good. I always order a Philly cheese steak calzone and add garlic and ricotta cheese. The customer service is always good and my order is always fresh and hot. I definitely recommend it. Plus their open until 6am for when you get the late night munchies!,positive
"We ordered through GrubHub for dinner. On the site, it says the delivery fee is $2.00. However, they called me and told me that was only within a 5 mile radius and it would be $2.00 extra per mile beyond 5. I was then told to have the $2.00 extra for the delivery driver. I found it unacceptable that they didn't just say ""we won't charge this time, but for next time"". I felt bad for the delivery driver because that money ended up coming out of his tip. When we got the food, it was bland, tasteless and only lukewarm. We won't be giving them our business again. Very disappointed.",negative
"On a Thursday night, delivery took a little over 75 minutes. We got two pizzas and an order of zucchini sticks, and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious.",positive
"At my job, we order delivery from here at least once a week (delivery usually takes about 45 minutes - an hour when we order at 11am). Unfortunately, nearly every single time, the order is wrong. The most recent time was the last straw, because when we called to tell them it was wrong, the man on the phone raised his voice and was incredibly rude, saying there was nothing they could do. He also argued with us, saying that he physically stood next to the cook while he was preparing it, and it was 100% right. When we brought the order down to their restaurant to prove that it was in fact wrong, they ""fixed"" the situation by giving us the sauce it was supposed to have - except that STILL was not right, because the replacement sauce they gave us was oily, watered down, and not at all the same sauce that we order and enjoy every week. So over it, will not be ordering from here again.",negative
We ordered at 1140- they called back 20 minutes after ordering to tell us they didn't have something we ordered. Okay? They said it would be 45- an hour. An hour goes by- nothing. I called and the girl said the pizza guy left 7 minutes ago. Well we are only 9 minutes away. 30 minutes later still nothing. Come to find out the driver went to another customers house that ordered after us first. By the time we got our food it was cold. Ive been trying to reach out to the manager for 3 days (which isn't on duty at night) the girl told me a name and it isn't the manager. So at this point I'm waiting to hear back. Kind of upset how this whole ring around has gone.,negative

"Came in with my Dad and We Ordered a Jalapeno Cheese Pizza at first . Oh Boy was it Delectable it just came out of the oven steamin hot, maybe too hot for TV Lol . and I burned my mouth Like a Son of A Gun Though ;)!! Ok so this is the pizza breakdown 1.) New York Crust 2.) Balanced Sauce neither sweet or salty and 3.) Plenty of Cheese, The interior was nice with old school retro pics on the wall and comforting place to eat and had and Service was very nice walked by our table a couple of times making sure we were taken care of.Overall very nice place to eat.Enjoyed ;)",positive
"Me and my entire family got food poisoning off a cheese pizza here. Do yourself a favor and go hungry tonight, it's not worth it.",negative
Ordered 5 lunch specials to our work today. Delivery was pretty quick. One lunch was missing the drink. Pasta was really bad. Noodles with green stuff on them. Didn't taste like pesto. Did t taste like anything. Just bleh. Garlic bread was good. Salad was fine. Pizza was fine. Popcorn shrimp had a bit of a shrimp deficit. Wings were good. Overall average lunch ...,negative
"Prices are pretty decent. I love the fact that you get fries with just about anything you order. The delivery time was pretty fast but it's kind of sad that they wont bring your order up to your room. If you order from Café Verdi, expect to walk all the way down to either your hotels valet or check in counter.... The pizza tasted pretty decent but as others have stated, it is indeed pretty greasy. The only things that made this a 3 star review instead of a 2 star review is the fact that they are open 24 hours and they brought my two can sodas ice cold.",negative
"After reading so many lackluster reviews, I was really hesitant on ordering here. But I pulled the trigger and went with it. I'm glad I did. They were extremely quick and it wasn't even an hour wait. The food was great. I'm a pizza guy and I like trying new pies and this place is very good. You get A LOT of food for the money. The delivery surcharges suck and add up quick (especially with tip), but you can order this food the day you come in and eat on it all week. I wasn't impressed with the french fries. The pizza, wings and chicken fingers were awesome. The pizza (pepp and sausage) was really solid and no complaints. Hot wings weren't really hot, but tasty. Sweet Chili chicken fingers were just that and delicious. They have really good ranch dressing, too! Give them a try! Food - 7/10 Delivery - 9/10 Price - 8/10",positive
"At 3 am, in a desperate stroke of hunger I ordered from here, with low expectations. As the only place in my area that I could find to deliver, my hopes were not high. I ordered via grub hub at 2:51, they were supposed to arrive at 3:55, and finally at 4:10 it was here. I must say that while the food was lukewarm and 15 minutes late, it was actually quite tasty. The personal pizza was smothered in salty cheese ans the sauce was light and sweet. The crust had a slight sweetness as well and was soft and pillowy like a bread stick. The mozzarella sticks were lightly breaded with no crunch. The ranch dressing (as requested) complimented the flavor perfectly. Even the chocolate cake beat the typical plastic-wrapped pizza joint standard. It was fluffy and not too sweet. It all reminded me of the kind of junk food you find at at a baseball game- a greasy, artery-clogging, guilty pleasure. This place is undoubtedly a go to for Superbowl parties and hangovers. The prices are great too- but unless you like to waste money DO NOT order delivery!! What should have been a $15 meal came out to almost $30 with a staggering $8 delivery fee and a 20% tip. For the food to be cold and late, it was definitely not worth the cost. Otherwise, great food!",positive
"The few times I've ordered I've had to wait over an hour and a half, the last order took 2 hours!! I waited 2 hours for luke-warm mediocre food. Needless to say I'm not happy and will not be ordering again. There are so many other places that have better food.",negative
Craving a Burger at 3am? Thats the place! Ordered few times. They are paying attention to any details you mention to them.,positive
"Super declicious! Always on time with delivery! I love their pizzas, I always get a large and create my own! Burgers are really yummy! Fries are yum! Love cafe Verdi!",positive
That was one of the best pizzas I ever had!! I order from them almost every day and most of the time I have my order in less than 40 minutes after my call! The fastest drivers and cooks I guess. 5 stars from me :),positive
"Great and convenient! Delivery was prompt and friendly! Mozzarella sticks were perfect even with the delivery, burger was delicious and so were the chicken wings. The best part of all, the brownie!!!",positive
"Did an order last night...not only did it take 2 hours for the delivery, the delivery guy forgot our pizza that was apart of our order. Called and they said they will comp us a larger pizza for the next time. Which was ok for us. Once we started eating our food we were even more disappointed. The good was stone cold and stale. Tonight we thought we would just use the free pizza comp and the pizza is charred and burned to a crisp. We will never eat here again",negative
"I had the misfortune of ordering food from Cafe Verdi through Eat24 yesterday and it was by far the worst delivery experience I have had since being in Las Vegas. The ordering online through Eat24 went very smooth. They estimated 60 minutes delivery time, which I was not happy with, but since they don't tell you the estimated delivery time until AFTER you order and pay, what can you do? Well, 60 minutes came and 60 minutes left and no food. So I used the Chat on Eat24 to find out about the order. Melissa said she checked with the restaurant and that it was out with the driver and it would be there in a few minutes. So I waited. After waiting 20 minutes, I chatted with Melissa again and this time she told me she would call the restaurant and find out about the order. Funny, I thought that is what she had done the last time, but this time it did take her longer to answer. She said it was definitely out with the driver and would be there in about 10 minutes. So the ""few minutes"" that she had told me 20 minutes ago was now going to be 30 minutes. Well, finally the food arrived - Meatball sandwich with frys and a pizza, 95 minutes from when I ordered. The driver offered no apologies. I took the food in and put in on a plate and took a bite of the sandwich. It was ICE COLD!!! As were the frys. The pizza was at best warm. So after 95 minutes, I needed to microwave my $30 dinner. This is no way to run a business for either Eat24 or Cafe Verdi. I figure they are both the blame. This is unacceptable and I will use neither again. I recommend you do as well.",negative
My favorite bean and cheese burritos E.V.E.R !! They are heavy on the cheese that came straight from heaven and their tortillas taste as if they are hand made everyday. They include a spicy red salsa that is to. die. for. Normally I have to drench my food in salsa for it to be satisfactory but this little container of salsa does the trick and leaves me breathless. Literally. A must if you happen to be in the west side of Phoenix.,positive
"Hand made corn tortillas, bomb birria, actual shrimp tacos and barley water? That my friends is as good as it gets! Wait, do not forget the friendly costumer service and the fact that is a hidden place and never too busy! Love it! This food reminds me of my home in Sonora Mex.",positive
Our family went here and really enjoyed our meal. It was authentic and flavorful. Toe of us had the carne quesadillas and they were great. The horchata was the best I've had.,positive
I've been looking for authentic tacos and Authentic Mexican food And I found it! It's delicious!!! I can wait to try all of the things they have in their menu! Plus the quality of the meats are great!! You have to try it!,positive
The Food Here Is Very Good! And Cheap. The Service Is Great. I Highly Recommend This Place. I'm Definitely Coming again.!!,positive
Had a cawamanta and i had it befor at other restaurants and it was just bad but her at cajeme its just amazing i just couldent stop eating it . and they also make in house homemade tortillas . wooow. Also try their tacos and their birria. this is a must try place . i highly recomend it to all,positive
This place is surprisingly amazing. The table side Cesar is absolutely perfect! Presentation on every dish was exceptional and flavour matched. I'm surprised that this restaurant is far superior to the steak house across the street.,positive
"Awesome foods & great service, very reasonable price compared to other restaurants. Great ambient, very dark & quite romantic atmosphere. Very suitable for a romantic night out. Foods - 5 stars Services - 4 stars Decoration - 4 stars Ambient - 4 1/2 stars",positive
"Really wanted to love our meal here. The room is elegant but without intimacy even though we were in a booth with a wraparound banquette but that wasn't a big deal at all. Service was on point for a steakhouse but the clearing of the table was slightly awkward as they stacked all the plates on top of one another, taking away what should have been 3 passes worth of dishes at once. I don't mind that at a breakfast joint at all, but Earl's doesn't even do that and a legacy steakhouse with $45 entrees certainly shouldn't. However that again was a slight misstep. On the whole the service was great. The real misstep was entrees. Hubby had a 9oz strip which was of good quality, well prepared to temperature but was under seasoned. Needed some finishing salt at the least. Vegetables were cooked perfectly, but potatoes had an unwelcome sourness that wouldn't have come from buttermilk or creme fraiche, so we assume the dairy that went in was proper spoiled. My beef Wellington was well constructed, and arrived at the right temperature but with 100% certainty I can say it was microwaved to finish it. Beef takes on an instant and unmistakable acrid flavour when microwaved and this had that in spades. Also, foie gras medallion was inedible to the point of almost testing my gag reflex. I didn't have a second bite. My Wellington was immediately replaced with a 6oz fillet which was perfectly cooked to temperature but also under seasoned. However the cut was of excellent quality and I really enjoyed it. My veg were also cooked perfectly except for the sour potato mash. Hubby also said he thought the texture would lead him to think instant potato flakes were whipped into the mash for stability. Table served Caesar salads were deftly put together by our server, who again gave consistent attentive but not effusive service. Wine service was also on point, and we loved our SuperTuscan we chose from their very impressive list. Desserts were absolutely delicious. Hubby had a lemon semifreddo which was more the texture of fully frozen ice cream, but it was excellent. Very well balanced cream and bright citrus. My chocolate soufflé was flawless. Overall we enjoyed our experience at Carver's but the food missteps were too big to overlook given the price point. Unfortunately would likely not return. Too bad too as Carver's has been around for so long and we like staying in that property. Food was 2 stars and service was 4. 3 overall.",negative
This place is ridiculous. .. we call to make reservations and they said we don't need one as its so dead and not busy that they don't recommend coming as they might close early as its not busy at all. We went back another time by chance they were open and they took the tableside ceasar salad off the menu. .. horrible business decision. .. the menu is average and overpriced. .. we will not be back,negative
"My wife and I ate at Carver's because it was raining. I wanted to go across the street to another restaurant. I'm so glad we ate here. We were very pleased with our meals. We both had perfectly cooked, medium rare, tender, tasty steaks (NY Strip and Ribeye), shared a Caesar Salad. Everything was perfect, service was excellent. Thank you, J&R",positive
"From the Sheraton's website I was told that carvers renovated recently. Wow, did they do a great job! The lighting and decor really invited you in and stated ""classy dining"" I was very impressed. My boyfriend and I were seated in a little out of the way table, and it felt cozy and secluded (which was good for conversation). The server was alright, she was cheerful and attentive. She mentioned the specials and asked for drink orders... All normal and expected. I ordered a caesar salad to start- which was alright. Not something that would wow you, but defiantly enough for two people- so keep that in mind. The mains on the other hand, DELISH! I ordered the leek cream salmon, it came with root vegetables and tomato risotto. The salmon was tender and seasoned perfectly. The risotto was amazing, so flavourful and delicious it could have held it's own as a main! The risotto and the salmon were a match made in heaven, just wonderful! We were too full for dessert, but from the rest of the food here, I bet it was top notch! This place is a bit more pricey then most- so I would only go back for special events. But, if you are a food lover... Try the salmon, you won't be disappointed! Also, the Caesar is no longer made table side.",positive
Hmmm I am from out of town and had a business dinner here. Wasn't too Impressed considering the prices. As soon as we sat down we noticed a spider running across the table. They comped us a cheery jubilee that was nice and a wasn't necessary. The wine was nice. The house salad was meh. The lettuce was fresh and crispy but nothing to right home about. I had the sockeye salmon which interesting enough came with udon noodles. Wasn't impressed with the fact that for $39 I got a really small piece of salmon and a pound of noodle with 2 broccoli. The steaks that my colleagues ordered looked much better. Anyhow don't believe that considering the prices the food was worth it.,negative
"Yumminess to the max! Loved the bread. Loved the tableside Caesar prepared by Linda. Our steak was divine. Really reasonable prices, considering it's a restaurant in a hotel. I highly recommend a stop here for dinner!",positive
"Good steaks and sides. Service is a bit ""relaxed"" not recommended for someone in a hurry. Amongst the better steakhouses in Calgary (Caesar's, Ruth Crisp's, Chicago Chop House) - easy to get to being the Northeast and free parking. It's hard to be as enthusiastic when you've eaten at as many Las Vegas steakhouses as I have. However, a good local choice for a meal.",positive
"One of my best friend's, Kendra, shared a $100 gift certificate for Carvers with my other best friend Marnie and I. The celebration was simply the three of us coordinating our schedules. I have heard many good things about Carver's through my other friend, Debralee, and she was right -- this place is outstanding. The atmosphere is dark, cozy and modern, and the staff is friendly and professional. The waiter asked if we have ever been there before. When we all replied that we havent, he began giving us suggestions off the menu. We started with a delicious bottle of Cannonball Cab Sav. He informed us that the caesar salad is made fresh tableside, so of course we needed to see that. A friendly, charismatic gentleman pulled a cart up to our table, and asked us first if there were any ingredients that we ""didn't"" want. We declined anchovies. He started whipping up the dressing and then mixed a fresh, crispy caesar salad for us in large heaping bowls. What was surprising to me, was how light the salad dressing was. The dressing was delicious, but not heavy like caesar salad can be. With our salads, they brought us out a basket of garlic toast. The bread was delicous. My only disappointment was that it was white bread. Not their fault -- I will know to ask next time. All 3 of is ordered steak diane. I ordered well done, and the other two ladies ordered medium and medium rare. Again, this was done table side. We watched him create our meal with perfection, and all of us had our tenderloin cooked to perfection. Steak diane was served with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, which was a grilled tomato with cheese, asparagus and turnip. The meal was unbelievable. Dessert -- we couldnt possibly. We were all stuffed. we ordered coffees. Marnie offered an Irish coffee, and that was yet another delightful spectacle. The cart came back to the table, and the waiter rimmed the glass with sugar and cinnamon. He put a generous amount of booze in the glass and crystalized the sugar and heated the alcohol over the open flame. He set the liquor on fire while we ooo'd and aaaah'ed. Then he added the coffee and handed it to Marns. Just before the bill came, he brought us 3 chocolate strawberries -- compliments of the chef. Nice! Carver's is now my favorite steakhouse in Calgary. For me, it is not conveniently located at all, but it was worth the drive.",positive
"This place should be named the best Kabab and Biryani place in whole of Ontario. The owner is so courteous and welcoming that it makes this place all the more appealing. The food here be it Chicken Tikkas or Chicken/Lamb Biryanis or Reshmi/Seekh Kababs, is exactly the flavour and taste you would get in India/Pakistan. I come all the way from Ottawa, just to eat and bring food back to last me a couple of days. The quantities are big enough to feed well 2 adults. Would whole heartedly recommend this place to everyone.",positive
"I went here years ago and tried their seek (beef) kebab and they were amazing back then. Went on a sunday night... -Seek kebab (No char marks, lacked BBQ flavour, but still ""good"") -Butter Chicken (small takeout styrofoam cup, was sweet, which was a turn off; few chicken pieces since small syrofoam bowl) -Tikka Chicken (same small styrofoam bowl, much better than their butter chicken and more savoury than butter chicken; very good) -Rice (plain and boring, obviously just a base for their currys) Price was about $20 per person after tip. Low value overall. My gripes are that they serve their hot currys (butter chicken tikka chicken, etc.) in a stupid little styrofoam bowl, so it is a very small amount compared to any other decent South Asian restaurant and it is dangerous for a person's health to consume any hot food that is held in a plastic container. The kebobs lacked the old BBQ flavour. No rush to visit again.",negative
"So I was walking down Gerrard St trying to kill time in between meetings and stumbled upon this place. Being rather bored of Lahore Tikka House (mostly due to its decline in quality and taste) I decided to give this place a try. First impressions wouldn't leave you ""speechless"" so to speak, but if you can overcome the basic and dilapidated decor you're in for a real treat! I ordered the foot long kebab and naan as it was highly recommended to me by fellow Yelpers and the owner himself. The kebab and naan was made to order, something I appreciated as that doesn't usually happen anymore; however this caused my meal to take some time to make. Once I got my meal I was very happy with the taste and quality, both the naan and kebab tasted phenomenal. I unfortunately didn't get to try anything else as they were closing midday for religious reasons (they close around 2pm on Fridays for prayers). I intend to back one day and sample other things on their menu as this place does look somewhat promising.",positive
"I walked in to this restaurant and saw a customer who already ordered something, walking away saying it was getting late for him and he doesn't need whatever he ordered. I ordered a veg Biryani and they asked me to pick it up in 15 mins and Later when we went and asked about it after 20 minutes the guy at the counter asks us to pay for it again. When I showed him the receipt he was very rude and snapped at me saying I should realize he was too busy taking orders to cook. The worst part was he did not accept that he forgot the order neither was he sorry.",negative
"I have been going to this place since I was small, almost 20 years now and I have to say they don't disappoint. We always order the naan kababs with chicken biryani. The food is always fresh and service is great. The kabobs are mouth watering, have the right amount of flavour and are well cooked. I will continue to visit this place for many years to come!",positive
This place is by far the best Hyderabadi food place I have been too! One of the best dinner places on Gerrad! There Bihari kabab and Lamb Biryani is a must try!,positive
"Well, I have eaten here a few times before, but after what I witnessed tonight, NEVER EVER AGAIN. I witnessed the most disgusting thing. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the owner take some salad and sauces that was left by previous customers dirty tray back in with the new stuff. DISGUSTINGLY NASTY AND GROSS. This was food that the previous customer was eating. No frigging way I will ever be eating here again.",negative
"This place has authentic kaachi gohst ki biryani, and it's absolutely divine! I've searched high and low for a place that serves this, and I'm so glad I found CC. In case you're wondering what it is, it's when the raw marinated meat is cooked over a slow flame with half-cooked rice. They're chicken biryani and bihari kababs are also great. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wishing to sample a taste of Hyderabad's royal cuisine- just make sure you call ahead and order for pickup to avoid long wait times.",positive
"Man this place is grimy as hell! Everything is old and dirty including the guys that work here. No care in the world for food safety and the guys are pretty rough. Been here a few times with average experiences but the last time was my last time. Ordered 2 foot long kababs one was full of fat (solidified hard pieces). Took it to the guy up front who refused to give me a refund. The guy in the back was preparing some kababs, picked up the piece of chewed beef fat off my plate and claimed that's how it was. He then proceeded to continue preparing the kababs. No gloves, no washing his hands. Disgusting!! We both knew that's not what it's supposed to be like. Definitely not returning to this dump. The city should shut them down for how dirty they are.",negative
"Chandni Chowk are definitely no frills, but their food is really very good and at a great price. Recommend - especially the Keema and Chicken Tikka. The naan bread is also soft and fresh. Good, accurate and timely service.",positive
"They are AMAZING! I recently put in an order for 20 people and they had everything ready before my time for pick up and they helped me load the car. More importantly, though, the food was AMAZING. EVERYONE enjoyed it the food.",positive
Tried this place for the first time when they were set up outside during a festival. The chicken tikka is amazing!!! Saw them cook it right in front of us and went back the next week for more. Everything was delicious- defiantly a place to hit up in the bazaar. Good prices too!,positive
Great place. Very simple but clean. Good moderately priced. $4.25 for a kabob might seem a lot but it's a foot long.. So the price reflects the size and taste of the meal. Enough food to fill you in but not overload.,positive
"It's amazing how much nostalgia a foot long can spark in someone. My family used to frequent here when I was a kid and continue to do so. I have a fond attachment to the place. My favourite part was watching the naan come out fresh from the tandoor. The long beef kebab is deliciously flavourful, but isn't spicy, which makes it great for kids. It comes with warm, soft naan and a bit of salad. You also get sauces on the side. The red sauce is amazing. It's got a sweet but tangy kick to it and I dip everything on my plate in it! Their vegetarian dishes at the counter are good, but not my favourite. It isn't luxurious by any means but it's affordable and good for big families.",positive
"Came here with my family on Eid ul Fitr for dinner. I know, bad idea considering Eid on Gerrard, but we were desperate and hungry. This seemed to be the only place that had enough seats for my family of 5 people. The line was super long, but it was Eid, so I don't blame anyone. My family and I had our orders ready, and when we ordered, the man at the cash register informed us that there was no chicken in their kitchen. This was a real bummer considering my whole family basically wanted some kind of chicken (chicken breast, chicken tikka etc). So quickly, noting the line behind us, we ordered beef ""footlong"" kebabs instead. My brother ordered the mutton chops. In about three minutes, our orders of kebabs arrived with naan, some chutney, and some basic salad (few pieces of torn lettuce and chunks of onions). The man at the front informed us that the mutton chops would take another 10 minutes. The naan and kebabs were cold once we put them in our mouths. We were so hopeless at this point, however, because we had no choice but to eat it to feed our stomachs! Later, the mutton chops arrived, and it was also accompanied with naan. Both of these items were beyond fresh, which left the rest of my family somewhat upset. After we finished our food, we were able to get our free kulfis that are offered after you pay the bill. Kulfis were the best part of the evening. On our way out, there seemed to be some commotion, and we discovered that there was vomit on the floor. There was only one waiter that night, and he was clearly overwhelmed from all the Eid customers. I couldn't help but feel bad for him upon seeing his face when he was told to clean the vomit. One star for this place that shouldn't really exist. Bad decor, bad service, and bad food. Will definitely never return here again. Maybe my expectations are too high?",negative
"Really tasty authentic Indian food... we order for delivery once every couple of months whenever we need a good curry 'fix' :) Delicious fresh ingredients, generous portions, and very reasonably priced, especially the 'dinner for two'. My fave is actually the Aloo Gobi, although the naan and curry chicken are really nice too. Hubby's fave is the Lamb Biryani. They get busy sometimes though, so I always ask before I place an order just in case, how they're doing! (I think they must have big parties or something once in a while and won't deliver, rarely though I suppose...)",positive
"Typical chili's in terms of food. Chili's is consistent with the presentation and taste of food every single time. My wife and I have eaten at thus location a handful of times. The only thing I feel this location could improve on is the serving staff, and to make sure the machines at each table are operable. A few times we have been here, it was slightly busy and the service was just average. We've been to this location when it wasn't busy at all, and the service was just average. This review is based on visiting this location for a period spanning one year.",negative
"Bleh. This is one of the worst Chili's experiences I've had and it was just super bleh. Nothing terrible. Service wasn't awful, food wasn't awful, but just so mediocre. I would definitely drive to a different location, won't go back to this one again.",negative
"Definitely would not recommend this chili's. We started off with chips and queso. The chips were adequate but the queso was horrendous. It was very unappealing and tasted horrible + the plate was chipped. Service was was alright. The service provided was ok. We sat by the open kitchen, big Mistake in which we heard workers making loud noise in the back. My entree was the boneless chicken wings. Might as well have gone to McDonalds, get bbq sauce and save my $12. Overall my experience was unpleasant and am not returning.",negative
"Order was incorrect, took 45 minutes to replace, replacement was incorrect, when we asked if they could do Something they took off five dollars from a 30 dollar bill. Not exactly correcting the problem.",negative
"Have taken my wife here several times for lunch because her work is nearby. Always great service. Love the 2 for $22 menu choices. Chips and salsa are one of our favorite appetizers. She likes the flavored tea here. Good burgers, awesome fajitas among other great choices.",positive
"The only Chilis I'll go back to. We always seem to get the same waiter (still can't remember his name) but he always remembers us as well. He's definitely a hard worker, knows how to get good tips. The food is always on point. Staff knows how to make a mean raspberry sweet tea & best thing.... we're always greeted with a smile & when we leave we're always told to have a great day.",positive
They have great food at this location always well cooked and always comes out hot but I'm giving this location 2 stars which I rather give them 1 star because management is awful and I'm saying that nicely the first bad experience I had was on my birthday and the second bad experience with management was last night . Let's just say this will be my LAST time ever eating at this location and for all my friends and family as well . The manager is RUDE DISRESPECTFUL and UNPROFESSIONAL. She is not a friendly person she honestly looks like she hates her job. I will be calling to get a hold of the district manager and will call cooperate to explain to them my horrible experience. I don't want anything for free for the inconvenience it's nothing like that I just really hope they reconsider who they have as their manager here. This is not someone I would want managing my company. I will not get into detail on here but I'm warning anyone who eats here stay away from the manager . If you look at any of my other reviews I am not one to write bad reviews I'm a very humble and easy going person .,negative
Had a wonderful experience. Fantastic server and if you go ask for server named Bruce. Great personality and amazing service. Have to see to believe...... And the margaritas are fantastic........,positive
"2 stars only because management handled the issue extremely well. 94.5 sanitation grade almost has us walk out but decided to give it a chance. Based on the food alone, I wouldn't have even given it one star. But since the waitress and manager were apologetic and wanted to correct the issue I gave 2. *see pics of burgers",negative
First visit and had the WORST service I have ever experienced at a Chili's. Will never go back to this location. Food was mediocre at best.,negative
"Today was the fifth visit in a row that we have had to send food back. Each time, management comes out and blames the server. New food usually takes 20-30 minutes to come back out, so everyone else has eaten. We had a server drop a knife on our son and swear in front of him. We've had cold food, raw food, burnt food, etc. We kept going back because it used to be so well run and the food was great. Not anymore. Don't waste your time. There are too many other great restaurants around.",negative
"After writing my review last November, I did receive a gift certificate and apology from someone with Chili's. However, I never took them up on the offer to make it up to me. I appreciated the customer service effort, but I have no desire to go back.",negative
Eat here with my family often. The service here has dropped off! Horrible servers! Not a happy experience. Felt like I was at McDonalds! Server has no interest in making us feel like we were dining out. Treated us like we were an inconvenience! Not happy and hope management notices and fixes problem soon!,negative
"I walked in and ordered a burger and two kids burger to go. I was told 20 min but after 1 hr I was able to get my food. During the long wait I could witness how dirty and disgusting was the kitchen. The servers were taking orders, manipulating money and then preparing food without any sanitation. One of the servers decided to lick her fingers while preparing a dessert and then touched the food again. I threw my food in the garbage when I got home and will NEVER EVER go back to this location.",negative
"Ordered take out which was scheduled to be ready by 8:20....well 8:50 rolls around and I finally get my take out. The take out is right beside the kitchen and all you see and hear is yelling and cursing. Food was also below average which I expected from the chaos that was happening. Also, my apartment is 2 minutes from the restaurant and by the time I got home, everything felt like it was pulled straight out of the fridge.",negative
"Great Food,Good Service! However I do not recommend you get broccoli from this location, they don't wash it properly and I tasted dirt.",negative
My wife and I have eaten at many Chilis restaurants across the country. We love Chilis and in particular the fajitas. We have tried this restaurant a few times since moving to the area a year ago. Each time the service has been mediocre and the food OK but not to Chilis standard... Very disappointing! Tonight we sat in the bar.. The bar tender was not very friendly. We asked for fajitas with extra crispy onions... The steak was tough... The chicken was barely cooked and it looked like the peppers and onions were thrown on at the last minute! We will not be going back.,negative
"Great food as always had the buffalo boneless chicken salad, very tasty. Chili's is always a good place to come to if you get home sick.",positive
"Food was perfect, waitress was great, everything on time, food was perfect temperature, and their menu has a lot of new options",positive
"We went in, set at the table for 10 min. 4 waitresses and the host walked by us without making any contact. Table was sticky as if a dirty rag was used to clean it. After walking out we find the manager hanging out at the door. He did offer to take care of us but after sitting down for 10 min without any contact we left.",negative
"Decent food, good prices. what you would expect from a large chain. This location stands out due to the staff. We've always had great service. Very attentive and we never run out of drinks or chips. Several of the staff have been around for a while and always take a moment to come say hello to our girls.",positive
"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. I save 5 stars for really amazing experiences, that way I'm not an every-'like'-is-5-stars guy. We went to this location Sunday because the Northlake location has annoyed us - they changed their kitchen line a few months or so ago and so now the grilled chicken for stuff comes out without the 'cooked' lines and it honestly looks / seems like pre-cooked chicken that has just been heated (although not microwaved). So we tried this Huntersville location - and were very happy. The waitress, although very recently hired, was super nice, attentive (brought kids' new drinks without waiting to be called). She talked with the manager to put in my request for vegetarian fajitas as part of the 2-for-20 deal and it came out perfect, it was super good and more than I could have asked for. The chips & salsa are fairly normal - I wish the salsa was more Sonoran style but you can't have everything. The kids food (grilled chicken and various sides) and my wife's food (margarita chicken) was good and cooked properly. The restaurant was not very crowded, which I understand based on location. They are a bit messed up because of the crazy way they re-did that intersection. The bartender forgot the orange wedge on my Blue Moon, but that's not a big deal, I only mention it in case the restaurant people read this.",positive
"Went in to eat on 11-10-12 and ordered the nachos to start. Getting toward the bottom of chips, I grabbed a handful of small chips and dip it in my salsa and start to chew, well guess what I chomped down on, a piece of glass....yes, GLASS. Told the waiter and he took the glass and I guess told a manager but no one came to me. Lucky for me, I didn't get hurt but still. I proceed to eat my ribs that I love and at the end of my last rib I now pull out a long ass hair. Now I tell the waiter again and I say, ""now I want something at least comped"". He says oh yes sir, so sorry. Me personally, If I was the Gm at this restaurant, I would of comped the whole meal. This guy didn't even apologize and all he gave me was 8 dollars off for my ribs. I love the food at chilis but I will never order from this chilis ever again in my life. Piss poor management. I still may call to the corporate offices and explain this situation.",negative
I had the Cajun Pasta and Shrimp. SOOOOO good.. Always love Chilis! The waitress was super nice and friendly. Food was hot and ready pretty quick. Anyone ever had the parmesan sweet potato fries? They are EXCELLANT...,positive
"My boyfriend and i go to this location about once a week. We always sit in the bar area (much better environment, no huge parties or kids running around), and we LOVE it if we get Gary or Nicole as our waiter/waitress. We always get great food and great service!",positive
"Do everything here, but take-out for lunch. See Mary-Beth inside at the bar; she rocks. Dining inside is always a pleasure; also, before 6 there are great ""happy hour"" specials....",positive
"I only gave it 1 star for its convenient location; if you don't want to walk out side in -20 weather, this place is good with almost no wait and accessible throught the +15. However the food is less then adequate, I really wished I had gone to macdonalds instead. Ordered the Korean spicy seafood noodle soup, but what I got was a bowl of rice noodle in hot water, soy sauce and a bit of hot sauce. The seafood was merely a few slices of imitation crab meat and some old squid meat. Veggies were a bunch of overlooked cabbage slices and broccoli. It really looked and tasted like something they threw together and put in the microwave. To be fair, this is a fast food place and their vermicelli didn't look half bad, but I am so disgusted by what I got for the money paid ($10.50, plus tip and tax) In conclusion, avoid this place if you want noodle soup! It's really gross!",negative
"Pretty good spot to come for either take-out or sit-down vietnamese. The service is VERY fast - they'll want to take your order almost as soon as you sit down, and it will be at your table within about 5 minutes usually. The food is pretty decent and consistent - I've never had a bad meal here.",negative
"Located in the Bow Valley building in downtown Calgary. It's easily accessible via the +15s and convienent for the lunch crowds that don't want to venture outside towards Chinatown. Explains why it's especially busy during the winter, although it's usually pretty steady at lunchtime. So if you're craving Vietnamese noodles (pho), korean BBQ or even Chinese stirfrys and don't want to venture outdoors during lunch, make sure to arrive a bit early or late to avoid the rush. My usual is either the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup (pho) with rare beef or the Rice Vermicelli. The flavors here are decent, they're not bad considering it's location. As mention above you can also choose their rice plates, which I haven't tried. They also offer traditional Vietnamese percolated coffee with the condensed milk, which has a nice strong coffee taste, where some places might tend to water down their coffee. It seems to be pretty authentic here. All in all not a bad place for lunch if you don't want to face the cold Calgary weather, but they also lack a lot of dishes that are at typical Vietnamese restaurants so make sure to check out their menu before you get a table. It might be that you'll need to venture out to Chinatown to get what you're craving after all. Oh one more thing though, they are QUICK. So if you're looking for a fast lunch. This would be a good place, if they're not packed and even if they are. There's always take out.",negative
"Came here for pho. It's located upstairs so you have to take the escalator. Paid $8.05 for their beef pho. A lot pricer than other places I've been to. But it turns out their pho comes in a huge bowl with top quality beef. I mean, the beef is really really good, and I've been to a lot of pho places in Toronto. The soup is mild, not as flavourful as I'm used to. Probably not as much msg as other places but I wasn't actually thirsty after the meal. One odd thing I noticed is they give you the usual bean sprouts and lime, but also parsley! No basil? Service was super fast. Took 3 minutes for my order to come. Fairly large space but there's a huge crowd during lunch time. I definitely like this place. and now I am so STUFFED.",negative
"I am in the downtown core frequently, and I love going here for lunch! The food is delicious, the service is lightning quick and the servers and extremely friendly. The only thing I would change, while they are efficient, is the slight lack of organization when picking up your order. Currently, you remember your order by it's number on the menu. If 10 people have # 41 you have 10 people wondering who's #41 is next? It would be much quicker and less confusing if the cashier assigned you a number and that number was called as your order came up. But, as far as beefs go, that's all I got. Otherwise I would eat there every day if I could!",positive
I just headed down to Collegiate Lunch but it's shuttered - green garbage bags carefully cover the window and glass door - looks like it's down for the count on a rapidly gendrifying strip.,negative
"This diner is awful! The ambiance is non-existent; the lights are never on, which adds to the sullen feel of the place. First walking in I noticed the mountains of Minnie Mouse memorabilia piled up in heaps behind the counter. There is a decent dining area, I will give them that, but this place is never packed. The booths and bar stools are nice and uniform and don't look bad at all, but placed in such a sad looking restaurant really brings down their appeal. I commend the owners for welcoming me into the diner so late in the day - I slipped in about 15 minutes before closing - but the good stops there. I ordered the french toast and home fries on the side, but was told that coffee was not served so late. After settling down in a booth, I fiddled around for a while in silence while I waited for my food. The hostess was not at all talkative and I have no idea how anyone was able to get any conversation out of her, maybe it was because it was late in the day? When my plate arrived I looked down to take in the contents, not impressed. The portions were very small, three minuscule pieces of french toast, crusts off, and a tiny portion of home fries which were squished onto the side of the plate. The quality of the food did nothing to change my mind of the place. Everything was soggy, the potatoes were salvaged with some ketchup but the underdone french toast was just a bust. The food was cheap though, coming in at exactly $6.50, but the quality was reflective of this. I was here once before and had ordered the fish and chips. The service wasn't too much better and neither was the food. The fish and chips were clearly frozen, expected of a diner. But the thing I took most offence to was the salad, which was still wet! The one thing this diner has going for it is the location, great family friendly neighbourhood and no other greasy spoons around for a few blocks, but I say just take the few extra minutes to walk to a decent diner.",negative
"I heard about collegiate lunch as being a great breakfast place...three of my buddies meet on a regular basis between the east end and the west end, taking turns to accommodate the distances that each has to travel...When we got there at 8 am, there was a sign that it doesn't open till 8:30 during the week...We patiently waited and waited and waited until 10 to 9 and the place was still closed...We left, thinking that should it open anytime soon, it would be a while before the coffee was brewed and the grills heated up...I doesn't seem like this place is a serious breakfast place.",negative
"A local introduced me to Minnie and she remembered my name from then on. She knew how I liked my coffee and eggs after the second. This place was nostalgic in the 80's, now I don't know what to call it. Unassuming for sure, it's down to basics Gerrard St East restaurant. If you enjoy the traditional diner feel, wholesome food served quickly, a great price and caring service with an honest smile then Minnie and her husband will provide it. From bacon and eggs at breakfast or burgers, sandwiches or soup at lunch, Colligate Lunch is a neighbourhood diamond in the rough. I just don't know why the local tradesmen haven't discovered it. This is a perfect place for them to get a quick bite, break or take-out... and avoid that 'M' place down the street that serves less food, lower quality at a higher price. Thank you Minnie. See you soon.",positive
"I am actually quite shocked that there are so many reviews for Collegiate Lunch, given that every time I am in there the only other people look like they probably don't own a computer and, if they do, it's certainly not connected to the internet (i.e., they are old). The food here is fine, but really cheap, and the service is good. You can get a full breakfast for under $5. It's 100% diner style with the classic counter and booths. I don't make it here as often as I would like because my girlfriend likes a bit of a higher class/three times the price brunch. In the rare situation where I am going it alone and out for breakfast this is where I go. I'll be the loser sitting by himself reading the paper.",positive
"Met my usual ""colleagues"" for our weekly Monday breakfast this Tuesday, and we were all taken by this neighborhood 'spoon. Minnie, the current proprietress, tells us that this establishment is ~70 years old, and she's been here for the past 10. She's friendly and efficient. The breakfast was a deal! 4.75 for 3 (small) eggs, choice of the standard 3 meats, home fries, toast and coffee. 'Twas all good...the bacon was ironed flat, and the coffee was above average. Minnie tells us she pays a lot for it, and she grinds it for every pot. Go for the good breakfast, linger for the collection of Minnie Mouse toys!",positive
"This place is truly a gem. I used to go to the high school in the the area and I've always thought this place was a lame bar that tried to lure students to come by calling it ""collegiate lunch"" after the school name. Then I went to try it because I was tired of all the fried chicken I had been eating at the places in the area, and let me tell you it was fantastic! It's not a bar, but just a simple lunch place. The server, Minnie was very memorable and was super friendly to us. As a teen that's dining out at a place with service, I found that that was rare. For around $5 plus taxes, we got coffee/tea, and a whole big breakfast meal with bacon, eggs, toast, home fries, sausages. After high school, I've been back and everything is the exact same, even the price. I swear this place is operating at a loss. I did notice that they don't serve coffee/tea anymore after 11am, but it's still a stellar deal. Don't judge the restaurant by what it looks like on the outside!",positive
"The place had the look and feel of a family-owned eatery in Fez! The hot tea was great to start, the pea soup was tasty with a slight kick, and the chicken tajine was good and plenty! Excellent service. I would object to the name ""Express"", because, although the food was timely, the owner was in no rush for us to turn over the table- We ended up losing track of time and was late for my next appointment!",positive
"There is no shortage of excellent reviews about the owner, Abdullah. He is as warm, gracious and kind as each review says. I had the pleasure of visiting morocco several times and the meal is only as good as the experience. That being said the meal and the experience were phenomenal. I find myself in that part of Phoenix often and usually resign myself to mediocre Mexican food. Now, I found my new favorite eatery. Thank you, habibi for bringing your cooking and hospitality to us. In the end it was us that won the lottery.",positive
This place is amazing. The food is delicious and the portions are large too. Been here several times and never been disappointed. The restaurant is run by one man who is very nice and happy to help with your order if you're not sure what to get. Very cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend!,positive
"Very easy 5 star rating! The food was fantastic and the owner took time to explain all of the food and spices and was even kind enough to share a couple recipes as he realized that I have a passion for good food. I had never met this man and left feeling like we had been friends for years. We started with a mint green tea that was unbelievable. Considering that I am not a fan of tea, I was shocked. Next was a split pea soup with loads of flavors. Main dish was a chicken stew that was the best stew I have ever tasted. Will return and highly suggest this place for Moroccan authentic food. Loved it!",positive
"My wife and I received a warm, friendly welcome by Abdul. The food was delicious and everything was fairly priced. We had the chicken and hummus plus the basil tea with a variety of desserts. All of it was delicious! Thank you, Abdul, for the wonderful food experience and great conversation! If we are back in the Phoenix, we will definitely visit again.",positive
"I have only eaten Moroccan food once or twice before. But after dining at Moroccan Paradise across from ASU, I liked it so much that I decided to try another Moroccan restaurant the following day. That's when I discovered Couscous Express, which I read is famous for their couscous and date shakes. When I entered Couscous Express, I was personally greeted by owner-chef Abdul who hails from Tangier, Morocco. Even before shown the menu, he had dropped off a few complimentary starters - a warm cup of bitter gunpowder tea, a bowl of mildly spiced hisara soup that was lentil based, and a microwaved piece of harsha that's like a thick disc shaped pan fried bread. Abdul told me to take my time, he would take my order after I finished the appetizers. I have eaten at Arabic restaurants where a hearty lentil soup is the first item served, and the hisara soup tasted very similar to that. It's like the ""miso soup"" of Middle Eastern meals. The menu was very simplistic, permutations of either kabobs or tagine, with the choice of vegetable, chicken, beef, fish, or lamb. For that reason, there was no paper menu passed out. Just tell Abdul what you want. I chose the lamb tagine, after having had chicken the previous night. The tagine was essentially an individual serving potted stew, very soupy, containing a melange of boiled vegetables, raisins (instead of dates), and meat. I ate it with steamed couscous which was prepared reasonably well - very moist and soft, somewhat fragrant, a hint of raisin-like sweetness. The couscous was not as spongy as rice that I eat more frequently, but it did taste good with the hearty low-sodium broth. I especially liked the broth because it had natural sweetness from the boiled vegetables. The broth was light but still relatively savory, it tasted great even on its own. Unfortunately, I was extremely let down by one aspect. I ordered lamb but I'm convinced that I received beef, although one of the servers assured me it was lamb. I don't think it was goat meat either. The lamb tasted really similar to the boiled beef stock that I add to my Chinese soup. No gamey flavor, tough resilient texture, very lean meat. It was my least favorite aspect of the tagine. In my opinion, using lamb or goat shanks (bone-in) would make the tagine taste infinitely better. Nonetheless, I had a positive experience at Couscous Express. Hospitality was the most memorable aspect of the meal. Chef Abdul treats customers like family, and dining in felt like being a guest in his house. It's a one man show in the kitchen but he somehow finds time to bus tables. Chef Abdul even refilled my broth and bowl of couscous without asking. It's impossible to leave hungry from this place. Between Couscous Express and Moroccan Paradise, I would pick Couscous Express if I wanted a more soupy and stew-like tagine, and choose Moroccan Paradise if I were craving for a more of a purely steamed bowl where a gravy is served on the side.",positive
Amazing food that taste like my homemade grandma's food! The service is the best. The tea smell and taste like flower! Amazing experience!!!,positive
"Very friendly owner serving generous portions of great Moroccan food. Be adventurous and try the fish head, it was delicious! Our favorite restaurant while in Phoenix.",positive
"Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised with how well our evening turned out. My wife and I gang out with some ""foodies,"" and they invited us here for a dinner out. After driving by twice, we finally found it. We walked in and found our group in the corner booth area. It was the only area that could handle our party of six. We didn't really order any food, which I found fun. I just said, ""Bring us whatever tastes good."" It could have been taken as me being a rude S.O.B., but we got what we ordered!! :) We had the lamb, beef, and chicken dishes. All were served with couscous and stewed vegetables. Everything was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. Thank you for a great meal and pleasant experience.",positive
This place is great! Very friendly and welcoming employees and authentic food. I was surprised that we were the only customers for dinner on a Saturday. I will be telling my friends to come here!,positive
"I have been in Morocco and my origin is from France. So I know couscous, tagine and all the good stuff from Morocco. After 18 years in the US I am glad that Abdul opened a restaurant here in Phoenix. I went today for Christmas day and we got his couscous. Thank you so much to the owner, Abdul. Not only we have been welcomed with tea, humus and bread when we went to pick up our order but once at home we had an excellent surprise to eat one of the best meal we could only dream about. Abdul you made our day. Thank you again.",positive
"I've been told my reviews are full of emotion. but I just cant separate it. Going to Couscous Express is not just great food it is an experience. You sit down and get this amazing hot tea (so good I got a to go cup just to have while working at my desk at work) and then the food. We had no idea what to get because even though the menu is small everythign sounds so good. So our waiter came by and he chose for us. We got the hummus first, it had an amazing spice level, the bread was great.. and then I was starting to get full.... The main dishes came out and I hated my self for not pacing myself. Its liek Thanksgiving dinner all over again. After taking a breather.... I started and WOW. just WOW. it was simply amazing. I preferred the vegetarian dish because you can taste the spices more but this doesnt mean the meat one wasnt good. Definitely going again. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. 5+ STARS!.",positive
"WOW!!! Saw this local restaurant advertised in New Times and was so pleased to have stopped in. I am a sucker for traditional Moroccan recipes for the herbs and spices and stewing. Home-welcoming service, authentic herbal and mint teas, fall-off-the-bone seasoned lamb, juicy and delicious chicken kabobs, and beautiful fluffy couscous. Everything was so appetizing that we over-ordered. But that seemed to be okay because we nearly cleared the plates and the food is surprisingly light that we didn't leave feeling bloated ;) I am happy to have found this authentic style Moroccan gem in our own backyard. Thanks Couscous Express, we will be back.",positive
"This place was amazing. I wanted to try something different for my birthday lunch so decided to come here. The service is excellent. They are very friendly and attentive. Be prepared to spend some time here, we had about 7 different ""courses"" and the atmosphere is relaxed. The sweet tea and hummus were great and the couscous was light and fluffy. I also loved the date shake, though it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. I can'twait to go back and highly recommend this place.",positive
"This could get to five stars once I have a go at the b'stillah, which the limited menu suggests is only available on Saturdays. Fair enough. The chicken tagine and lamb kebabs the other evening were perfect and honored guest/brother in from out of town with the sophisticated palate was pretty amazed Phoenix had excellent Moroccan on offer. Abdul, the proprietor, is a fun conversationalist and was happy to play DJ for us and honor our requests for Algerian rai, gnawa and Moroccan trad. Enjoyed the intimacy, simplicity and furnishings. Definitely coming back.",positive
"Abdul was a great host; we came in with a group of 6, and he brought us several small plates with bread and hummus (SO. GOOD.), as well as individual couscous dishes (including a vegetarian one for myself). Date shakes followed for dessert, and Moroccan iced tea was plentiful. Their customer service was great, and the food was very flavorful. He charged us $12.95/person, which was a great deal considering the large amount of food! Nice ambiance and decor for a small seating area, felt cozy. Definitely recommend, and hope to go back soon!",positive
"The seating is comfortable and the service was very attentive. They had a large party arriving when i arrived so i was pleasantly surprised to receive such good service as it is a small location (which can often be overwhelmed by large parties). The spicy Tangier hummus was delicious, and it came with a very soft flat bread. It was a great starter. I had the chicken Tanjine. It was very savory and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It came with couscous (of course) which was perfect for soaking up all the juices. There were small bones in the dish, which wasn't a problem, but something to be aware of. The portion was generous, such that I could barely drink the date shake that arrived at the end of the meal. In the past I have found date shakes to be overwhelmingly sweet - but not this one. It's made with peanut butter and cinnamon and was really good. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",positive
"Wow! We had a horrible day of travel returning to AZ from a week in Ohio finishing with a final flight that was more wild than some of the roller coasters we had ridden at Cedar Point. Before that flight we were planning on a big meal upon arriving in PHX to celebrate our return - but the flight left us all green and thinking a quick snack may be better. Then we pulled up Yelp and found this place ;) It was a bit sketchy looking from the outside and we had to drive past once to find the parking lot, but we've never let that stuff scare us off from trying a new restaurant as we learned a long time ago that some of the best food is hidden in the roughest looking places! I didn't think to double check their hours and we pulled in right a few minutes after closing. The owner was very apologetic and offered us food to go since it was their closing time. We explained that we had just landed and still had an almost four hour drive to Yuma ahead of us so to-go wasn't going to work ""but thanks, we'll be sure to stop in next time we're in Phoenix"". But upon hearing that he said ""I used to have a date shake place in Yuma, I know the drive you've got ahead of you - Sit, we'll stay and feed you for your drive"". So we sat :D Our daughter loved getting to sit on the couch and pillows at their largest table and before we even had our chairs under us there was wonderful iced mint tea in front of us and a small date shake for our daughter. Then before we could blink we had some great mildly spicy hummus and amazing fresh pita bread, followed quickly by a second non-spicy hummus that was served as whole beans rather than pureed. We could have left at that point and been super happy and satisfied! The owner then apologized to us in advance that since it was closing time he wasn't able to offer the full menu - but the lamb couscous and the chicken were available. We were already thinking the lamb sounded good so we went with it. The serving was plenty for the two of us and he brought us date shakes as well. I'm not normally a fan of date shakes but his were unlike any I've had before - less sweet and more savory with some wonderful spices and a peanut flavor that complimented the sweet dates perfectly. Our young daughter is a picky eater and was acting up a bit. We finally got her to try the couscous only to be embarrassed by her spitting it out and wiping her tongue off. But the owner just smiled and thanked her for trying it then gave her a scarf with plastic jewels and bangles on it which cheered her up greatly. We ended up stuffing ourselves silly and still had to ask for a to-go box :D The cook came out and shared his own Yuma story with us as well and he was just as friendly accommodating as the owner. It really felt more like being at a family meal than a restaurant they were so friendly and inviting. They then gave my daughter a second scarf absolutely delighting her and earning them a little dance show from her in return. When the check came I was wondering if I had read it wrong. There was no way that much great food and service could come with such a low price. Between that and them staying open past closing to feed us I couldn't help but leave a generous tip as I felt I'd be cheating them not to. Then as we were getting in our car the owner came out saying we were too generous and insisting on giving us a few small bottles of the argan oil they sell. Jaw drop. I don't normally give a five star review on one visit - but based on the other reviews I have no reason to believe that the experience we had was exceptional or unusual for this restaurant. I'm already trying to think up some excuses to get back up to Phoenix soon so we can enjoy Abdul's hospitality and food again soon!",positive
"Great Middle Eastern food. Amazing customer service. I ordered the lamb dish to go and while I was waiting Abdul let me try their hummus, ice tea, and date shake. All were great, but I was surprised how good the date shake was. I'm not a huge fan of dates, but the cinnamon and peanut butter mixed with the dates is amazing. Lamb and couscous were great and filled me up with leftovers for later. Definitely coming back with my wife and friends to get the full dine in experience.",positive
"We went with a group of friends last night and had an amazing experience. Abdul was the perfect host and spoiled us with house-made hummus and pita bread, carrot salad, peas soup, delicious chicken and lamb kebabs, the lightest, fluffiest couscous I've ever had, chicken Bastilla, and, of course, date shakes, It was all extremely good and Abdul treated us as if we were guests in his home. You must try this restaurant for a truly unique and delicious experience!",positive
"A recommendation from my pal Norm, always in good taste and never bad form. He always delivers with a solid five stars, so walk here or run or jump in your cars. Couscous Express delivers phenomenal customer service and awesome food! We were seated, greeted, and before I could open the menu, I was chatting with my lady on how I hope they have hummus on the menu. I was jonesing for some of that garbanzo bean delight, I'm sure my hands were shaking from withdrawals; I've not had any in about two days and my home supply was depleted. No sooner then I had finished that thought, the waiter brought out some of the best tasting hummus I've had, and fresh out of the oven pita. Was this guy reading my mind, probably, their service is just that good. We ordered the beef couscous to share, which was a great idea because it was perfect sized for two 'small plate' eaters, but I totally could have killed that entire dish myself, and then some too. Oooh, it was so good! After dining and sampling their house made date shake, I was assured by the waiter they had plenty more delicious food that he would love to serve me, especially their soup. I almost caved under the pressure, but I couldn't eat another bite; they sure do know how to make you feel like you're part of the family. Requesting my check, the waiter asked if we would like more hummus, more date shake, more anything, he is at our service. I'm pretty sure hat I replied with ""OMG, I'm so full and every bite was fantastic, I couldn't possibly take one ore bite!"" I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm not a fan of dates, I've had them on a number of occasions and don't love them; more of a neither here nor there sort of thing for me. I'll probably give the date shake another try if I run into it again, but if you love dates, they've got one here to satisfy that craving. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your enemies too, if you're covering dinner at this spot, they'll change their mind about you. It's time to eat Moroccan food people, see you around and happy Yelping!!",positive
Loved Cous Cous Express. It is a nice hole in the wall place with amazing food and service. The cous cous is served in a platter (unless you order vegetarian) for the table so order a couple of dishes and share. I recommend the lamb. It was very tender and flavorful and the date shakes are the best part. The Chebakia is a very sweet treat at the end and similar to an item served in Indian Restaurants.,positive
This place is amazing. The lamb tastes absolutely amazing and the chicken is delicious. Don't forget to get a date shake and definitely try the mint tea! Service was outstanding. I will be a regular here,positive
"My son and I went and loved the food. We had the lamb couscous, my toddler loved the restaurant and all of the food. Looking forward to bringing my husband!",positive
At the first moment you walk in you feel welcome Start with the minimalistic authentic decorate The atmosphere let you feel for few minutes that you sit at street restaurant in one of the alleys in Marrakech market in morocco. About the food The couscous taste like a dreamy cloud. I start smiling on my first bite and that smile just getting bigger every time All the couscous dishes are amazing Vegetables/chicken/ beef/ lamb However my favorite is the lamb That cooked for hours and the fat melt in the sauce Also they serve Dailey home made dish/ salad With pita bread. Hot and fresh. They make there a home made ARISA. It's a mix spices a bit spicy but not like hot sauce that's the real deal. Every dish serve with mint tea And if you lucky you gonna have the honor to enjoy the one and only dates shake. Enjoy your next meal...,positive
"This is indeed a hidden Gem; I was waiting for one of these to arrive in Phx ever since I went to Marrakech, Morocco. It just felt like Morocco!!!! My partner told me about this little hidden place, so I took her for lunch and were we delighted! The food and the date shakes are to die for. To the owner Abdul, who treated us with much respect and hospitality we say: muchas gracias por su hospitalidad!! Merci pour voter hospitalité ! We will come back soon, but next time with four more people!! :) Amazing place...",positive
"A all inclusive meal, great hospitality and good food and decent prices. What more could you want? Sit down and you will be greeted by bread, carrot and cabbage dip like salads, great olives, and an aromatic tea. You did not order this, but it comes with the meal. They are all well prepared and delicious. You meal choices are simple. Couscous with your choice of meat (chicken, lamb, beef) or vegetarian(stewed veggies in spice). Price for this all inclusive deal are about $10 +- $3 And by all inclusive it includes the mentioned dip and bread. small plate of a couscous veggie garbanzo bean salad, tea and even a desert bite. The service was great too, imagine visiting a family members house and their soul goal is to make sure you eat and eat and enjoy yourself.",positive
"This place is really good! I took my meal to go and it was pleasant. Next time I will dine in just to experience good hospitality. The man behind the counter was super friendly and hospitable. By the way, get the lamb cous cous, it was amazing. I can't wait to return.",positive
"Wonderful delicious and savory food. Owners are really nice and treat you really special. Come here for a healthy lunch that will have you groaning in savory delight. Come here and try this you cant regret it. As a person who almost only eats vitamin and nutrient rich foods, couscous express offers a delicious option for diets such as mine. Go here if you're hungry looking for a value or if you are looking for the most quality for you dollar; this place delivers both.",positive
"ALL ABOARD! THE MARRAKECH Express has arrived in Phoenix! HIDDEN GEM ALERT! This is a tiny but exotic Moraccon Restaurant with only four inside tables and four big bench tables outside. Much of the food they serve are slow braised meats that mostly come with couscous. It's like what your grandmother would prepare for you if she was Moroccan. The male owner was just like my grandmother. I kept telling him I was full but he kept bringing us more food. Pricing is very low and portions are very large. (currently they offer a $5.99 lunch special) We entered not knowing what we'd order and then the owner introduces himself and makes light conversation with us. He tells us to sit down and he said he'd just bring food to us to try. We started with Date Shakes, Moroccan Mint Tea, House made Lemon Cured Olives, Fresh Baked Bread and Moroccan Carrots. It was all good and it was all fresh! Next came a soup. It was thickened with Garbanzo Beans and had noodles. This was a goat based soup. A BIG generous dishes of slow braised fall off the bone tender, beef ribs, and lamb arrive, a dish of stewed potatoes followed by a plate of tender flavorful dark quarters of chicken on a platter with more couscous and an assortment of vegetables. We also tried tasting style chicken bastilla. That's a puff pastry stuffed with their really good and tasty chicken, cinnamon and powdered sugar. What a FEAST! And it ended with house made Moroccan Desserts! Pricing was very low and potions were very large. A current grade ""A"" Maricopa inspection is posted. The Restaurant Front is Rough but it's a Gem inside. Parking might be difficult. (I parked next door) Get your Couscous on at Couscous Express! call them for their hours of operation Hours at this time are M-F 10:30-5 and Saturday 11:00-4",positive
Service was great - really friendly server. Food was good. Enjoyed lunch and will be back again. Thanks for a nice meal!,positive
"The food was really good but I'd like to mention the awesome waiter I had today. Kevin was really kind and fun! He was on top of things and was very friendly. As a rising star waiter, I think he deserves to move on to the next level! Great service. Great food.",positive
Loved the melt in your mouth meatloaf. Not as homie as Mommas but you know what left a taste of goodnesss in my heart. Love the cute setup and store. First time here for lunch not dissapointed one bit. It was my first time down in Phoenix yummm thank you server. Ice tea to die for. Unlimited tea. Taste like home.,positive
"I honestly only come for breakfast but if you've got a group looking for a southern style meal then head over to the C.B. As it's a family style restaurant. The wait use to be the issue for me but now you can go online to put your name on the waitlist so when u show up you aren't caught up in store buying a bunch of stuff (or trying not to break stuff) Overall food is good and comes out pretty quick. The congestion of people in the store or just the tables when eating can be a bit overwhelming. I'm a bit of a germ sensitive person so I gotta wipe down that Peg game (addictive game) and do wish they could do more to clean the tables and floors, but so much traffic it's hard to do without having a bucket out mopping or cleaning. I can never figure out the rules for bread (maybe for dinner request, but we always ask for it. Cornbread, biscuits, butter and jam... Additional Bottles of syrup available on request and I have to admit the staff seems to work together to support each other. Cleanliness is a priority for me so would like to see more done to improve overall restaurant & restrooms... I want it to feel more like s restaurant and not a truck stop country store.",negative
Great experience and food all around. The two hostesses were pleasant and quickly got us a table. Rachel was our server and was amazing. She had a fun vibe to her and she recommended the fried chicken special which most of us took. It was delicious just as she promised it would be. Constantly kept checking on our table and seeing if we needed anything or refills. Food: it was nice they were still offering breakfast menu at dinner as my Son was dying for some breakfast items. The young lady (Elizabeth?) who checked us out (food bill and a few store items we purchased) greeted us with a smile and treated us in a way that made you want to come back. Overall great experience end-2-end.,positive
One of my favourite old style American restaurant. I visit at least once a month. Price is cheap and food is good. Highly recommended.,positive
"Menu changed! No more delicious single patty 1/2 lb. bacon cheeseburger on a toasted large bun. Now it's a double patty on a small bun leaving a greasy splotch on your plate and in your mouth. Tasted blah as the meat vendor must have changed. Not the same. Whomever made this change must not of sampled the product. This was a corporate change going the wrong way. Normally my wife and I can always count on CB to have consistent quality, but not in this case. Yuck. Don't waste your $10 on this item.",negative
"Great Spot For Home Cooking Food! Great sweet tea! Great country fried steak or chicken meals! Great prices! Great sides, especially the yummy okra! Cool atmosphere. Friendly Service too!",positive
"Cracker Barrel USE to be our favorite place to eat - especially for breakfast, not so now. Why, you ask? Let me tell you. The food is WAY less than stellar! The biscuits, which use to be light, golden brown, and fluffy, are now HARD, over-done, and inedible (not to mention they're extremely stingy with the jam). The scrambled eggs (which I have) are hard, over-cooked, and cold. We ask for crispy bacon and it comes out limp (and once again, cold). My biggest gripe is the Diet Coke! The Diet Coke at Cracker Barrel is ALWAYS FLAT! Not sometimes, A L W A Y S!!!!! I think the warm liquid is poured over the ice, which makes it flat - just a guess. In short, my favorite place has turned into the worst. We won't take friends there any more, and we certainly won't be going back.",negative
"Great food and large selection. Nice comfy, homey feeling. Great lunch specials for $5.95. Amazing fried chicken on Sundays. Have been going their for years and its always good.",positive
"Since there is no possible way to say this lightly, I will be straight up and let you know what I thought of this place. If you are coming here and you're claustrophobic and you have to wait for a table, this is not a place for you to be. The staff is friendly, but some of the staff is not so friendly. Here's the reason I'm giving this such a low rating, we came here on a Monday morning looking to have breakfast before our flight. We made sure to give plenty of time so we were here by 10 in the morning which our flight wasn't until two in the afternoon plenty of time to make sure we have our meal without rushing. We have to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Monday morning, the lobby which there is none so we waited outside until our names were called. We were sat at our table, along with three other tables that were sat around us at the exact same time. It took our waiter 15 minutes just to come and say hi and ask if we want to drinks. By the time our drinks came back which was another 10 minutes, we were ready to place our order which we did. If you minutes went by, and then we started to notice the tables that sat down after us Headstart to receive their meals. We asked the waiter which we finally got his attention after 15 minutes of trying to flag somebody down. He said he would return, of course he did not. I then asked to speak to a manager which promptly a manager did show up. He checked on our meals which we discovered at that time where never placed, at that time it was realize we have been there for almost an hour with no food one drink and a lot of frustration. I have always wanted to come to a Cracker Barrel, but now no I will never return to one due to the lack of service I received at this location. I am sure other locations are much better and you give better service, but I will not take that opportunity to find out due to the lack of service from the staff here at this location. On a sidenote yes the manager was willing to give us a free meal which I was not willing to take because I do not want to wait anymore time for a meal to arrive.",negative
Ive ate here a few times. Its always good. I usually have breakfast but today i had country fried steak it was delicious!,positive
Just lunch to go. Once we got home and opened the roast beef plate to find two very small pieces of meat most of which was fat. Very Disappointed. .. My wife got the chicken dumplings which was a large portion and great taste.,negative
I would say this place is just okay. Service was fast but was a little over priced for just me and my son. He got french toast I got pancakes and we spent over thirty bucks. kind of wish we would have kept lookin.,negative
Food was just ok. It felt like a down home Denny's if that makes sense. If not oh well...lol. Service was great but the quality of food was lacking for the price. Probably won't be back anytime soon.,negative
This is my husbands favorite place to eat when we visit a city that has them. He loved his meal he always gets the chicken and dumplings. Unfortunately I ordered a grilled chicken salad and my chicken was raw. The waitress really didn't seem to think it was an issue. No manager came over or anything. Raw chicken is serious.,negative
"I love this place! My favorite thing to order is their yogurt and biscuits/gravy. It always smells amazing in there and the gift shop is cute. I don't like the crowded feel, but everything else is nice and I've always been seated within 10-15 minutes upon my arrival. Bathrooms are clean and the music is lively.",positive
I'm not a breakfast person it's usually my least favorite meal and I don't usually mind skipping it......but this place makes me LOVE breakfast. Great food great service and not over priced and I love the atmosphere!,positive
"We love coming here. We don't get to very often but when we do it's always nice. We've only had breakfast here 4 or 5 times, but we would go back any time. The food is always good and the service is always above and beyond expectations. Love the atmosphere and although it's always slammed and packed is worth it. The portion sizes are large, and you will never leave hungry. Love the little gift shop with all the neat things to look at. We always talk about buying little things but seen to forget after we are so full.",positive
"I Cracker Barrel! The Buttermilk Oven fried chicken is so good! Sometimes they run out of it though which is a bummer. The catfish is awesome too. Cracker Barrel is one of the best places for fried okra. It's hard to find elsewhere. I can't finish this review without mentioning or favorite waiter, Cody. He is so attentive, super nice and friendly. He also remembers what we like to order. Thx for a great dinner tonight !",positive
"We went on valentine day for breakfast. It was a party of 16, we were told that there was a wait of 20 minutes. ....30 minutes passed so we asked if our table or tables were ready.... the host told us that we had to to wait an additional 30 minutes... I asked to speak to a manager. When speaking to the manger there was no apologies all he said that he can not ""magically"" make room for us..... My response was WOW! I know this is not Disneyland! Unfortunately, we didn't get to experience great service, all we got is BAD service, sarcasm and unprofessional ways to treat a paying customer. I didn't even want to leave a STAR but I have NO CHOICE but to rate this restaurant for their horrible service in order for me to share my experience. I don't and won't recommend ANYONE with a large family to come to this place since they can't do MIRACLES (according to the Manager) to accommodate a paying customer, party of 16",negative
"This review is probably more a review of the location than Cracker Barrel in general. I'm from the South and appreciate good Southern food. CB is consistently good. It's not top-shelf food, but it's inexpensive so I feel like it meets my expectations. I've had consistently good service here and the employees are usually really friendly. I go every few months and usually end up here on Saturday or Sunday morning, so I've been very happy with the service and food, especially considering how busy it is at these times.",positive
"I love this place. I'm from California and we don't have Cracker Barrel. Every time I'm in Arizona, this is always my first stop. The service and food are great. My children love to play checkers while they wait for their meal and then we always enjoy shopping in the country store afterwards.",positive
"After being ignored down the street by Arribas Mexican grill, we enjoyed the spicy grilled catfish and the chicken fried steak, it was delicious!",positive
"Pros: Good food, good price. I love that they offer healthy alternatives like egg whites, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, non fat yogurt with fruit and more. Fun to look around the random store but why would you buy anything there? Cons: The wait is always forever to get in, tables are crammed together in 2 small rooms. No flavored creamer and drinks and food normally come out at the same time.",negative
"I have no Clue why people this this place was good. It was bearable at best. The food was not awful, but not anything to jump up and brag about either.. The Store is interesting and I suggest you look through and browse.",negative
Worst breakfast I have ever had. Ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage. Gravy not hot and had to ask for more and still not enough to cover biscuits and sausage. Was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick. Never again.,negative
I've gone there several times just for breakfast and have never been disappointed. I love the service. They are very friendly and thoughtful. I love the hash browns and the grits. Seems like a old fashion combo. The food is always warm to hot when I get it. The coffee is always full and I don't have to hunt down the wait staff to get my coffee filled. My mom came down from Montana and she loved the wall decorations (she could relate) and the over all experience.,positive
"First and foremost, I LOVE Cracker Barrel, so it pains me to write this review... I suppose I am just spoiled by the amazing Cracker Barrel chains in the South that I've experienced, but this place doesn't hold a candle. I ordered breakfast, which was just alright. I ordered Cheesy Grits and they were terrible - under cooked, no flavor whatsoever, and just had cheese on top. Gross. The pancakes I ordered were no better. They were covered in oil... to the point where I could squeeze the pancake and have it drip oil. I abandoned them after a couple of bites. The staff was super friendly, so plus one for that, but this is by far the worst experience I've had at this chain... ever. I don't think I will come back.",negative
"Yes...I admit it...I've a soft spot for southern food. CBs were reminiscent of the food I grew up with in childhood. Although not authentic in all flavors (to my memory), it certainly hit close to home anytime I was on the road. I was saddened to learn that there was nothing closer than AZ or Sacramento.... On a day of a craving, I hopped in the car, drove to this location and ordered my tradition: country fried steak, fried okra, biscuits, steak fries, mashed potatoes, and crumble for dessert. Service was good (consistent with the fellow CBs I've been to across the country) and food hit the spot.",positive
"Super bomb ! I give it 5 stars you have to try the veggie pizza,! It's to die for if your wanting vegan or organic they have it all!",positive
"Horrible customer service. Screwed up My order, initially refused to offer a refund or discount. And the owner lied to me On the phone. My correct order came almost 2 hours after I ordered and the owner felt it was fair to charge me Full price! Was eventually able to get a refund through eat24... If I could post zero star I would. Actually being lied to by the owner should be negative 5 stars",negative
Only one person working literally taking orders and cooking. Waited over 45 min and still didn't get only the JUICE I ordered . Asked for my money back after the people that ordered after us got their food before never again ! Horrible customer service,negative
This place is a hidden gem! I had the caprese salad. It was fresh and delicious. Service was really fast and friendly. Can't wait to try more menu items. Picked up an order on 7/25/16. Noticed the Heath inspection grade has been downgraded to C and the store smelled like sewage. Thought people should know before they order and pay online.,negative
"I ordered from this restaurant today at 2:30 through an app called Eat24. After receiving my food, which was on time:), I started to eat it and I ordered the soy noodles. It was dripping with olive oil as I tried to eat it and I quickly got disgusted. Being that I was hungry I dabbed the oil and tried to stay happy lol. Then I also ordered the quinoa salmon dish. So I opened that and it was like a soup. I'm not too sure why but I was only able to take about three bites before I was done with that. The last thing I ordered was a salmon wrap. Which was okay. The wrap was very slimy, but it was probably because I had it delivered and I understood that. After this I was going to come straight here because I was mad that it tasted like that after spending $40! But I thought that would be bad if I didn't give them the chance to fix it and make me like the food first you know. So I gave them a call and spoke to Isabel and explained everything that I just typed. After putting me on a 5-6 min hold, she told me that there is nothing they can do because to issue a full refund they need to be able to take the food back. But I threw the wrap and noodles away already. After that I was mad because I am a business owner and if there is something that my client is unhappy about, I will do everything in my power to fix it and make them happy. Even if it means I take a his or loss with their sale. It's not about the sale not but the 24 other sales later that you need to worry about. I will post a pic of the quinoa that I still have and I hope this review helps you when deciding if you should eat at this place or not. Thank you",negative
"It's hard to find a place that does delivery orders and doesn't require a nap after eating all the greasy food. They have A LOT of items (smoothies, juices, salads, wraps) I ordered a burger here the other day and even that tasted pretty healthy lol. The smoothies are real fruit & not the packaged frozen stuff some places give you and the juice is pretty tasty for being mostly veggies.",positive
"The fried mushrooms were not seasoned, but okay and I would order again. The real crime was with the caesar salad. Who & why would someone substitute real cheese for powdered cheese?? Not only did they use the powdered cheese, they liberally coated it all over effectively making the lettuce inedible lint. It felt like someone mixed my salad up with a 5yr old's spaghetti dish.",negative
"This place used to be my go to place for quick health conscious food. Unfortunately due to an experience with poor customer service, a 45 minute wait without notice or apology and an incredibly rude hostess, they have lost my business. I am a restaurant investor and have a successful business. If I was the owner of this establishment, I would seriously consider terminating this employee. I asked her once about the food and was received with hostile reactions. 4 others witnessed her lack of regard for service. Following that, she then ignored the next customer, blew them off completely. When he asked how long the wait would be for a wrap, he was then rudely quoted 45 min. She stated ""they were busy."" By that point, the room was empty. To add insult, once I was furiously handed my food, I realized that my favorite dish was packed up without avocado and any seasoning. In order to rush me out they just put whatever they had ready in a to go box, highlighting that the problem with this place is not just with the hostess, but with the entire establishment.",negative
"Just had the ribs, baked beans and potato salad. SUPERP. Very choosey about potato salad and this did not disappoint! I ordered extra sauce for the ribs and I was not disappointed. This was a delivered lunch and it came hot and fast. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs. I will order from here again. I have them on speed dial.",positive
We ordered three salads and had them delivered for lunch. They were very good. The ingredients were fresh and the dressings in the side like we asked. Two of the three salads were missing an ingredient listed on the menu though.,positive
"Just discovered this place...Awesome whole in the wall..Excellent menu items for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The healthy options are incredible. I ordered the portabello pesto mushroom quesadilla on a spinach tortilla. I was thrilled when it arrived and it was very little cheese with a huge mound of grilled fresh veggies...Super Fresh, healthy and DELISH! The pesto was excellent, not to salty like most pesto sauces...Wow, it was a huge portion, could have been great for sharing but i was so hungry i made my lunch buddy order his own food. I will definitely return to this spot..Friendly service with a smile and loads of options, no matter what your taste buds are in the mood for, there's something for everyone...Can't wait to go back.....Only thing i would say is, PLEASE DELIVER FORKS WITH THE FOOD, instead of making guests wait to get forks so they can actually eat the food while it's still hot. Or put forks on the tables ahead of time. Thank you! ****WE TRIED THE PIZZA THE OTHER NIGHT FOR OUR 2ND VISIT-OMG, the flavors were unreal, so fresh and delicious-one of the best pizza's i have ever tasted---THANK YOU SO MUCH-KEEP IT UP******",positive
"I ordered a milkshake. It (along with the rest of my order) came very quickly, but turned out to be piss-warm, vanilla-flavored milk. The cheesesteak and fries were so horrifically salty that they wound up in the trash. $20 down the drain. Would not order from there again.",negative
"Their wraps are delicious, filled with fresh organic veggies. If a wrap is what you are looking for, this place doesn't disappoint. Tons of choices. They have spicy salt for their steak fries which I loVe, but often it's forgotten. You can fix that by asking for them to put it in the side.",positive
Always great food! Love the Kabobs! They are really careful with gluten free food and the food is always fresh! Thanks Maggie! Great service too!,positive
"Great! I had a delicious organic greens salad and a roasted eggplant sandwich, really great! I cant believe how inexpensive this place is too!",positive
Yo this service is slow as f*ck... I'm over here waiting for a goddam salad to go for like damn near 30 mins Wtf is taking so long to throw some damn veggies together!?,negative
"Amazing I have been ordering from Daddy's for over a year it was at one time one of my favorite restaurants alas this is no longer the case by using a popular ordering app which describes my delivery time as being 45-60 mins. the last 2 time I have ordered it has taken over an hour and a half. My milkshake arrived as flavored milk, my curly fries rubbery, soggy, and cold, and my chicken Alfredo a brick of glue. I will not be ordering from them ever again. If they would at least call to say that they are running late with my order and give me the option to cancel it this would be a very different review. The disappointment I have experienced with them has now encouraged me to write a bad review. I will now have to tell all of my friends that I have suggested this place to that I am very sorry for even suggesting it. I would not even take food for free from this place now!",negative
Was on vacation in Las Vegas for the North American Hairstyling Awards and was staying at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club behind the flamingo. I was too tired to go out for something so I saw this place on grubhub and ordered a pepperoni pizza. I was impressed by the menu it had EVERYTHING you could possibly want. Delivery was much quicker than estimated and the pizza tasted amazing. Wood oven baked. They delivered right to my hotel with no problems and they called my hotel room phone to let me know it was ready at the front desk. I will remember this next time I'm in town,positive
"I was just here with my dad, we walked in and there was 2 women on a table to the left i assumed customers. Turns out they weren't they were workers but we did not even get a Hello or Welcome. We sat and looked at the menu and in about 10 minutes no one had came to take our order. In those 10 minutes the women got up and went to the back. I made eye contact with another woman who had came from the back and to the register, i expected her to come and take our order. She did not. I peeked my head to the counter and saw her just sitting. I got up to place our order. We asked her if there chicken noodle was from the can she said yes. I had a doubt so i asked her once more, she then said no it was fresh. She did mention she was new. Food was good, shitty customer service",negative
"Nonexistent guest service. The food was just so-so- the chicken fingers were dry, the pizza kind of dry, but the wings were good. The chef salad was a joke. 1 slice of processed cheese, 1 slice of ham, 1 slice of turkey, quartered on top of a bed of warm iceberg lettuce. Plus, they messed up our order. We had placed it for pickup, so we had to make 2 trips for a mediocre $70 dinner. This will be the one and only time we order from here!",negative
"The first time I called to order I received very poor customer service over the phone. I had to even ask her when I should come to pick it up, and how much it would be, AND give her my name because she didn't ask. I give people the benefit of doubt, so I went back about a month later and used grub hub to have them deliver to my job, (that is 3 miles away) I checked my grub hub order and realized I hit pick up instead of delivering. I called, seemed like I got the same exact woman. ""Daddy delights!"" I asked if I could switch my order to delivery, and she quickly responds, ""I'll tell the driver"" I had to once again, ask the expected time, the amount that may have changed, and if she could repeat my order. When the delivery Guy came, he Called, to let him in. when I got to the front doors the first thing he said was "" next time be sure to have someone let the delivery man in"". I felt awkward and ignored the rude comment. Instead of tipping him what I was going to, I gave him a dollar! NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN, and my food WAS GROSS! The falafel is very poorly made. the second meal I got was pasta with avocado, tofu, and tomato. It was cold when delivered to me. And the vegan cheese was only in one spot. I seriously was scared I would have some type of food poisoning the next day. I don't recommend this, at all. But, I hear their pizza is good. I'm vegan so I'm selected to certain foods. But I now know to avoid this place after giving it a second try.",negative
Fast delivery service. And the staff is nice when ordering. In love with there salads. Adding avacado Yummy Best salads ever,positive
"I don't know about your daddy, but my daddy never got down like this!! Once again I am wishing for that 3.5 star option. As the food is fresh and flavorful. The service however, NEVER FRESH. Or always fresh if you consider a fresh mouth by the staff! I am not sure how long they have been off Western, in the hood. But I do know I have ordered from here (delivery) at least 8 times in the last year, possibly more. They have the classic pizza, wings, and subs. But DO not waste your money on the unhealthy options. Daddy's is here for fresh juices, smoothies, salads, vegan stuff, kabobs, and other Mediterranean health food. I have had the chicken kabob, the chicken and brown rice wrap, and numerous different salads. The only time the food disappointed is when I ordered pizza! They take pride in what they're good at. The pizza and wings are just extras for the customers that come from the strip club across the street. Smart advertising really. I would be willing to give this place 4 or even 5 stars if they treated people a bit better. When rushed, the food lacks quality, or takes forever. At least 3 times I waited over an hour for delivery. I have never been treated with great service. A please and thank you goes a long way. I will be willing to up my review, if they up their game as well.",negative
"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars if I could. a sketchy neighborhood, and slightly difficult to find, but inside is nice. They're friendly and serve many different dishes. We got a quinoa salad and it was above average. Portions are not as large as others said. Overall, a pretty good place.",negative
Today was my first time ordering from Daddys Delights & I have to say the food was actually pretty good! I ordered Chicken Wings with French Fries & the wings we're delicious! I also ordered the Vita C & it was really good! My boss also had some the night before & he said it made him feel so much better because he was getting a cold! They are super fast on their delivery I am very impressed! I found it a little pricey though.,positive
We order from here every Monday since it's so close to our shop. We have been ordering from them since about July and they have only messed up our order ONCE. People are just people like you ! Very yummy though and the menu is HUGE.,positive
"Incredible food! A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth paying for the rare healthy meal in Vegas. One star off for the sketchy location and touchy service...",positive
"This restaurant has delicious and absolutely healthy food! Amazing! I usually get the chicken tzaziki wrap along with a papaya/peach/pine/orange/mango smoothie! The place may be a hole-in-the-wall across from the strip club on an industrial street, but the food is a MUST-TRY! Every time I have gone, the service was exceptional. A family-owned business so you're always going to get a family environment feel.You may have to wait awhile for the food to be ready only because everything is freshly made! This place is amazing!",positive
I don't even want to give this place one star! It took almost double the time they quoted me for them to prepare my order. While I was waiting I heard the cashier on the phone with another customer that was complaining about their order. Got home and started to eat the chicken and rice wrap when what do I find?!?!?!?!?! A really long hair! BARF! Never eating there again!,negative
"This place deserves recognition for doing things a little bit differently. It's a little hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere so you might not expect much walking in. I don't know how many times I have to say this but don't judge a book by its cover. It looks like a family owned and run place --eastern european, russian or something --I don't exactly know but that's not important. What is important is their unique menu and wide variety of choices. I actually found myself a little bit overwhelmed when I looked at all the choices -- many of them healthy some of them not ( this is a pizza place after all). They do all the unhealthy stuff that you're used to eating and craving at a pizza place but if you need to check out something a little lighter you'll be right at home. They offer a wide variety of platters, salads, wraps quesadillas, and of course pizzas. Many things on their menu are vegetarian, vegan, organic or otherwise health friendly but not all of it of course. The first time I went here I tried 1 of their signature dishes-- the chicken chop. It was brown rice, chopped chicken and plenty of fresh vegetables served over some field greens and looked kind of like a salad mixed with a chicken rice bowl. Big old portions and quality ingredients. I couldn't complain cuz it tasted pretty good too. I've also had their mini chicken pizza served with mozzarella cheese, pesto and diced tomatoes on wheat dough. A tasty and surprisingly filling treat well complimented by the side of onion rings I tried that day. Business seems modest for this place and I don't know if they will survive. I think it would be a shame if they went under because they bring something different to the table in a city saturated with greasy and unhealthy vices. I really recommend you give them a shot because they at least deserve an a for effort.",positive
"Pretty good small place, hipsters rave about it . But it's just average . Only like 8 tables inside so always seems busy . Not much around this area so it gets a lot of business that way I think .",negative
"My buddy and I hopped over to this little Kensington hole-in-the-wall after driving to their sister restaurant (Blue Star Diner) and finding renovation signs in the window. I'm glad we came here, though - this was one of the best brunch meals I've had since moving to Calgary. Cheap, it is not - I browsed a few reviews already of patrons complaining about the menu prices and affluence of the neighbourhood - but the food quality was definitely there! We sat on the patio at Dairy Lane and enjoyed prime people watching as we sipped on waters and made small talk before our server arrived to take our orders. As this was back in August, I can't quite remember what exactly I ordered, but it was delicious. The eggs were soft and light, but buttery - read: not oily - while the meat was a tad dry and unseasoned. My friend's Benny order was screwed up, but he decided to take the Omelette that they had made instead and really loved it! The server was very friendly and accommodating, despite the order screw-up, but the service seemed a tad rushed for not even having a line out the door. Perhaps this place could benefit from having an extra server during brunch hours. The café is small and cozy, with a beautiful wood-themed patio, comfy seats and a relaxed, easygoing ambience. The clientele consisted of chatty urbanites and youthful couples. If you're in the neighbourhood, Dairy Lane is certainly worth stopping for!",positive
"Let's talk about the big ""V"". Dairy Lane; a darling little diner tucked into the upscale inner city neighbourhood of West Hillhurst, just north of trendy Kensington Rd. The restaurant is small, cozy and tastefully decorated. The staff are friendly, down to Earth and eager to please; like your best friend's new love interest looking to impress. the menu is not over-done. Perfect choices for those who want a good hearty meal and for those who want something a little more special and creative. Everything down to the lighting is just oozing with ambiance; surely you've found the perfect little spot to bring your next swipe right! She will think you are so sophisticated yet so down to Earth! All is well... until your eyes scroll slightly to the right on the menu and you see the prices... uh oh.. I hope she didn't see my eyes swell... don't want her to know I'm cheap until at least the 5th date! Look, I have no quarrels paying $300 for a dinner that is more experience then meal. I also look forward to my next trip to Opa or MacDonalds where I can pay $8 for a delicious meal with consistently good service. It is all about VALUE. Dairy Lane has so much to offer just down the street. However, I'm sure I am not the first person to walk out of there thinking to themselves ""This must be one of those neighbourhoods where people have more money than they know what to do with."" Now it has to be said that the food is really good! All around conscious efforts to source sustainable, great quality ingredients and plate with just enough flare to dazzle and impress but not make you feel like you should have worn a suit. The burger; outstanding! The eggs benny; spot on! Hey, I'm sure there is more then enough reasons why this place is packed every day. Good for them. I have to imagine though that the prices are what they are simply because they can. The VALUE is not there. I'm sorry but $10 for bacon and eggs.. wait my mistake... it's $10 just for the eggs; it's an extra $5 for the bacon. My personal favourite was on the specials board. Wednesday's are $20 for a burger and beer. Are there really people who consider this a great deal? In this town? For a great burger? Your choices are endless! Kensington and 17th Ave are littered with great restaurants with the same weekday special for half of that cost. At the end of the day Dairy Lane is a great restaurant and I'm sure they will continue to do well. Good on them for having a successful restaurant business in this economy because that is not easy. However, there comes a point in your pricing where you are no longer good VALUE for what you are offering and I think they have crossed that line. Their weekday specials are more then what most good restaurants charge on Saturday night and, I'm sorry to say, the food just isn't 80% better for, on average, 80% more money. Bacon and eggs with coffee for 2 people should not be a $40 meal. I simply cannot justify that. The VALUE isn't there.",negative
"Homemade delicious, yummy local cafe! A can't miss on any visit to Calgary. We loved it so much we ate there twice during our 1 week visit to Canada. We enjoyed both breakfast and lunch menu items. Even our picky 11 year old son was pleased with his hamburger and fries which is always a plus!",positive
Had the chorizo stuffed French toast and it was to die for. My sister had the eggs benny and they were great too. Home fries probably the tastiest I've had. Adorable little place.,positive
"Delicious! I went here for a brunch date with my boyfriend, we definitely chose the right place to try! What a cute little cafe. We went on a Sunday morning, and though seating inside had a 20 minute wait time, there was plenty of seating outside. Good thing it was a warm Chinook day. My boyfriend got the Triple Double and I got the Eggs Benedict with back bacon and grilled tomato. I'm a sucker for eggs benedict and Dairy Lane didn't disappoint! Portion sizes were great and the hash was so good. We were both really happy with our meals. We were so hungry and the food looked so good I totally forgot to take pictures! The cafe had a great atmosphere, service was great, and parking was easy to find. Over all it was a great experience. I'll be coming back here for sure.",positive
We've been going here for 15 years and it never disappoints. Breakfast Sammy and Eggs Benedict are our staples. Go on a Saturday so you can browse for clothes at Tapestry while you wait for a table.,positive
This is a nice spot to enjoy a patio breakfast. The food was decent. Ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. Eggs were farm fresh and nicely orange in colour. I would come here more for the patio experience on a nice morning.,negative
"The novices in north american cuisine we are tried for the first time the famous eggs benedict, and it was absolutely delicious! I prefered the ones with spinach and sautées mushrooms, I think that the smoked salmon hides the taste of the eggs and the hollandaise sauce. The hash browns were well cooked and soft inside, the grapefruit was tasty. The presentation was nice. On Saturday morning-lunch, it seems really busy (they put you on the list and you wait for 30-40 min) until 1 am.",positive
"We found this place on Yelp on our last day in Calgary. We arrived around 10:30 and the wait was only about 20 minutes... which I thought was great for a Saturday morning. I ordered the smoked salmon & avocado benedict. My boyfriend ordered the cheese burger. My benedict was excellent and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal too. The only gripe I had was that our food took awhile, when compared to the tables who ordered before/after us.",positive
"I think I've finally figured out how to enjoy brunch. Over order. Simple but genius right? Well, it was a Sunday so being in Calgary, we obviously had to go for brunch. I still can't get over how much Calgarians adore brunch - it reminds me of Montreal so much. We decided to check out Dairy Lane Café, which apparently has been in the Hillhurst area since 1950! Wow, 65 years and going strong. The place is tiny and packed. DLC is one of those places where you're right in the grill of your table neighbours but the chatter is loud enough that you can carry on a conversation without feeling like others are eavesdropping on you. People were constantly putting their names down on the wait list. Crappy weather meant the patio was closed and inside can fit about 20 people or so. Arriving around noon (way too late), we were told the wait would be about an hour. At least they give you coffee/tea on the house while you wait outside. Or more like death stare the people sitting by the window and will them to hurry up and finish their last piece of toast! - Stuffed French toast ($13.50) - two options to choose from (sweet vs. savoury) - we went with sweet. Cinnamon cream cheese and field berry compote on French bread with a side of local potato hash. We were both a little skeptical about cream cheese in French toast but the dish was well executed. Just enough that you could taste the cream cheese without it being overpowering. The French toast is huge with two slices topped on one another. The hash was good - nicely seasoned. - Eggs benedict ($15.00) - three options to choose from (bacon/grilled tomato, smoked salmon/avocado or spinach/garlic mushrooms). We went with the smoked salmon! Two poached farm fresh eggs, english muffin, house hollandaise with a side of local potato hash. The eggs were perfectly poached. Smoked salmon and avocado is a great combo. Add that with the heavenly hollandaise sauce, you have a killer eggs benny. - Marinated prawn tacos ($15.00) - this was on their featured menu. Three prawn tacos filled with roasted poblano pepper and avocado creama, cabbage, black bean pico di gallo, queso fresco and cilantro. It also is served with a side of BC kennebec potato fries. In hindsight, we should have asked to sub one of the sides for something less carb heavy (so many potatoes!) but all good, we know for next time. The tacos were excellent. The shrimp had a great flavour and the addition of beans gave the tacos additional heartiness. We had to fight over the third one, I won. Another good spot in town to grab brunch. Heck, they're even open for lunch and dinner. Get there early or else be prepared to wait. Tip - you can wait inside if you walk around the back near the washrooms. Hopefully, next time we'll be able to sit out on the patio.",positive
"Tried it today and will now be a regular. Upon entering I was made to feel at home and I was very comfortable. The staff were professional and the service was first rate. I ordered a pork and chorizo burger with a side of black bean and corn soup. The flavours were vibrant and tasty without being overwhelming. As information, the inside of the restaurant seats 25 or so people, and another 20 or so on the sidewalk patio. That said, the tables seem to turn over fairly quickly and those waiting were given coffee by the staff. Nice touch. They serve wine and beer, and seemed to have a nice selection of desserts. I can't wait to go back. Give it a try. ....and back I went for a late afternoon lunch. Note: Kitchen closes at 4 PM for 30 minutes. I had the Dairy Lane burger with bacon and fries. It was terrific. I noticed the list of Alberta suppliers on the wall. The local sourcing of food combined with the care and attention it gets in prep make for great results.",positive
"We came to Dairy Lane solely based on yelp reviews (God I LOVE Yelp!) And as always we were not disappointed! I Enjoyed the Eggs Benedict w back bacon and Tomato, and my companion the breakfast Sammy.. We both loved our meals and the hand cut potatoes are cooked perfectly! The coffee was delicious and the cups never got below 3/4 full when the servers asked if you needed a refill! We will definitely be back!",positive
"I was looking for a new breakfast restaurant to go to and this popped up as one of the top spots in the area. I have to admit, I wasn't disappointed! This cute, little cafe is the perfect spot for your Morning breakfast with friends. So far I have only tried the Bene-which I modified to back bacon and avocado instead of tomato, which I would highly recommend. The service is quick and friendly, and the room, although smaller than your typical restaurant, fits the atmosphere of the place. The only small issue I have is with the line up which could have you waiting nearly half an hour to get a seat, depending on how many people you come with or the time of day, but it's well worth the wait! Will be going back here again in the future!",positive
"Best vegetarian and gluten free burger ever. Hands down. And the fries? Ermagerd. They taste like fresh (not frozen!) Potatoes. I'm a Vancouver food snob and I have to say, nothing in my beloved Vancity has come close. Just freaking check it out.",positive
This cafe is amazing! The service is friendly and efficient. It's very popular so you'll either have to wait or call ahead before you go. I had the chicken club and it was delicious; I loved the baguette it came on because it soft and fresh. The avocado also made the sandwhich. I'd highly recommend this cafe!,positive
"Dairy Lane blows my breakfast loving mind every time! I have a problem with Dairy Lane. WAIT, no, that's not what I mean... I mean I have a Dairy Lane problem! When I'm without their Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Eggs Benedict for too long, I'm pretty sure I start experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Order anything form their menu you want. You won't be disappointed. Personal stand-out items: The aforementioned Back Bacon Grilled Tomato Bennie. It's the perfectly classic concoction. The tomatoes add this wonderfully tangy juiciness to compliment and cut through every bite. I actually get emotional with the way the egg yolk spills over the back bacon and into the english muffin below. Things to know: It's tiny. There WILL be a line. Try go at non-peak hours if you can, but there will still probably be a line. Luckily, they help soothe my eager anxiousness with a coffee advance, and a waiting room (hallway) in the back. Personally, I prefer to check-in and then go for a stroll through the neighbourhood. Just maybe assure them that when you all of a sudden walk off with a coffee mug, that you are indeed coming back. On second thought, maybe just don't do that at all. I'm sorry for the surprise last time, Dairy Lane. You know I love you.",positive
Yep its tiny and yep its busy but it is so good! If I want breakfast I make sure to be there 10 minutes before they open (and there will be a line up) so I get a table right away. This is a well supported local business and lets face it Calgary is a big city. You aren' t the only one who will have the great idea to go for dinner or breakfast at Dairy Lane and you may have to wait. The food is fresh and tasty and perhaps a bit pricey but that could be because it is locally sourced and high quality. This isn't a fast food burger so you will pay the appropriate prices.,positive
It's been a year and a half and after so many failed attempts to grab brunch here we finally decided on dinner after reading it had one of the top 10 burgers in town. Even at 7:55pm (last seating at 8pm) we got the last table in the place. Whew. I got the regular burger with side salad and husband got the bison burger special with fries. The meals were simple but really tasty. You can tell at first bite they are using quality meat which makes such a difference. This was a tasty meal but the room is really small and you could hear everyone's conversation. This bothers me less at breakfast/ brunch - not sure why...at dinner it is slightly annoying. Patio for me next time where the light traffic and neighborhood noises will drown out the next table!,positive
"I love Dairy Lane! My to-go place for brunch. There is no parking lot for the restaurant but lots of parking on the sides of the block and right in front of the restaurant. The place is pretty small, but there is a waiting area in the back if you don't want to stand outside. They also offer free coffee for people who are waiting, I guess to help cope with the wait time. The eggs benedict here is one of the best I have ever had. The english buns are always toasted perfectly and the eggs are poached so well! Although, they never ask you if you want the egg soft, medium or hard - you can always request it though I would think. I have tried many items on the menu including the cold cucumber soup, mandarin orange sesame salad, the burger (topped with everything - even an egg!), the breakfast poutine and french toast. Everything is always amazing, and I never have a single complaint about the food. The service is also really great, they are very attentive but never up in your face while you try to eat. The pricing is fair, I think it is basically standard for most brunch places in Calgary with items ranging from $10~15. My bill for two usually ends up being around $30, including tip. I think it's extremely fair considering the fact that the food is mostly, if not all, local. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone!",positive
"Dairy Lane is a great spot for breakfast and brunch. Actually, they do a really nice lunch as well! But I am going to focus on the breakfast part of their business. My absolute favorite thing here is the Hillhurst Breakfast Sammy. It's two fried eggs with aged cheddar on sourdough toast with tomato, butter leaf lettuce and red pepper mayo. Hash browns on the side. It sounds so simple. And it is. But that's why it's so good! It's just so tasty. It doesn't lie, set false pretenses, set high expectations and then disappoint... it's just straightforward and so delicious. If you like savory breakfast that doesn't involve eggs as the focus, this is for you. Their orange juice is fresh and amazing, and their breakfast cocktails are good too! My sister often gets whatever they have as their breakfast special, which can be found written on the chalkboard on the wall. Normally, their specials have a special little something, like rosemary whipped cream. Sounds odd, tastes amazing. The only drawback is that the place is so small that you inevitably have to wait for a table. But if it's nice out, you can loiter by the railing outside and pour yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. Cream and sugar provided.",positive
"Small, and cute space! Had to wait ~45 mins for a table but the Dairy Lane gang gave us coffee (Fratello coffee, which is so delicious I pounded 8 cups of it in the total of 3 hours that I was there) and a place to sit in their waiting-hallway in the back. The wait was super interesting too 'cause they have pictures and bios of some of their suppliers there. They were getting a shipment of pork that morning and I had to do a double take because the dude lugging the pork in was the same farmer on one of their posters. To know that Dairy Lane Cafe has that kind of close relationship with their suppliers is amazing! The food is amazing too, I ate the ""Triple Double"" which had a little bit of everything: bacon, sausage, ham, eggs, and potatoes. I was stuffed and the prices are super reasonable. Can't wait to go back",positive
"I rolled in here on a fresh sunday morning, a winter day where it gets pleasantly warmer after a long spell of sub zero days. I was a bit late for a *cough* but before I could send an apologetic text, she beats me to the punch with ""I'll be 10 mins late...sorry"", so I naturally played it off like I was there on time all along :P Dairy Lane Cafe is one of those brunch joints you know you're going to have to wait and despite the recommendations I've received from people, they say the wait is always worth it. The waiting itself provided a great experience. You can stand around with a coffee cup in hand and a blanket (to maybe share with) in case its too cold. The dining room is surprisingly small but all the more active and vibrant, encouraging conversation for people who harbour the ""low Sunday energy vibe"". Their staff was very friendly and offered not only great suggestions, but humour and conversation. We shared an elk burger w/ fries, and a pan scrambler with sausages. Everything was delicious but I wasn't as inspired by other brunch cafes. The prices were quite fair. Oddly enough I heard from a friend that this place went wayyyy back to when it was really a diner dive joint and breakfast could be bought with the change in your pocket. Is this true?",positive
"I am glad Kat and I got married in August. I could imagine bringing her here for breakfast on our anniversary, and standing for 45 minutes in a blinding blizzard - not my idea of a fun time. The Sunday we came down here was a typical busy period, with a half hour wait. We were offered refreshments while we waited in the cloudless sunshine, and we played Sudoku while our tummies grumbled back and forth in a noisy competition to determine who was the hungriest. Finally, when we made it into the restaurant and ushered to our quaint little table, we were surprised at its size; tiny. Maybe 500 sq. foot tiny. And the turn-around at tables was impressively quick, a system honed through the generations. The decor was loads of fun, and a blackboard above the kitchen listed the local locations where their fresh ingredients come from. Needless to say, you could tell the difference local makes. My Tex-Mex omelet was fluffy and succulent, and Kat's eggs benedict were perfectly done, runny as she likes them. It was a great breakfast, and I would definitely come back to try their other offerings. Perhaps take up Dan's recommendation of the burgers? 5/30",positive
"Oh man! After hearing so much about Dairy Lane's Burgers, my expectations were pretty high. And I gotta say ... they lived up to the hype. It is exactly what you want (or at least ... what I want!). Super fresh ingredients (mostly, if not all, local I might add) and perfectly seasoned, delicious meat. Well worth the price you pay. The decor is adorable. Such a cute little restaurant. VERY clean. And the place is ALWAYS packed. For good reason. The service is really good too. Friendly, well balanced. Classy. I like Dairy Lane because you are getting really good quality food, very well prepared in a quaint, friendly environment. I will definitely be back.",positive
"was pleasantly surprised by the many vegetarian options available at dairy lane! i ended up getting the carribbean jerk vegan scramble and it was incredible. the restaurant is tiny, so it fills up fast & you might end up waiting for a table, but the food is worth it! service was friendly and the coffee is quite nice.",positive
My husband and I decided to try this place for brunch based on the reviews. It is a small and friendly place. There is a 15-20 min wait usually but I would say it is worth it. Our food was really exciting and we would definitely go back again.,positive
"I love Dairy Lane. The food is consistently great and the service is always good. It is a wonderful local gem that serves organic and local food. I am particularly fond of the breakfast tostada and burrito, but everything that I have had so far has been good. It can be a bit crowded on weekends but it is definitely worth the wait.",positive
"Love this place! So tiny and adorable, but I believe that it's long line ups are a good indication of how delicious it's breakfast is. I will occasionally hop over to Dairy Lane with my Dad, or my coffee loving friend who adores that they actually serve decent coffee here. I find that if you come in groups of two, you get in faster than other larger groups, which is slightly unfortunate, but I'll live with it for delicious eats. The wait generally doesn't last too long, and you're provided with coffee, and blankets if its particularily chilly I used to frequent for the vegan tofu scramble, but it would seem it's changed slightly and is now a little spicier than I can handle for breakfast. However, I now like to go around lunch for the delicious black bean soup, and the super hospitable server informed me the garlic toast was also safe for me to eat. I love this little gem.",positive
"Tried Dairy Lane for the first time with my family - and while we waited outside for a table, we were served yummy hot chocolate to take the edge off the late winter / early spring morning chill. Once inside (it's tiny!) we were spoiled rotten by brisk, attentive, oh-so-friendly service, and the food is to die for. I had eggs benny (medium poached) with smoked salmon + pickled asparagus + hash browns, my wife had an omelette all-in, and my son had the four-cheese grilled multigrain sandwich with tomato basil soup. Best breakfast I've had (and that's comparing with The Palliser, the Danish Canadian Club, and Diner Deluxe). I'm most definitely coming back!",positive

"Picking up a pre called in cake for a life celebration party and decided to have dessert before lunch. We got to the store a little early since we thought opened at 10 am, but it is really 10:30 am. The staff shooed is out for about 15 minutes but I totally understand since we're so early. Besides the cake pick up I had a small strawberry sundae with whip and nuts. My son had a small hot fudge sundae extra fudge. There ice cream always takes me back to my childhood too. The service was great even brought them to our table, such a sweet place to enjoy more now that it's going to break 100 mark.",positive
This place smells so bad. It's like sour milk and raw sewage mixed together! You can even smell it out in the parking lot. You open the door and it hits you like a brick wall in the face.,negative
Don't bother coming here. We ordered 2 simple menu items and waited more than 20 minutes. Finally I went up to the counter and asked where our order was. Turns out they didn't even have it. Waited another 10 minutes and got 2 different items we didn't order. Totally incompetent!,negative
I grew up on orange julius' in Balboa Beach and Whitwood Mall. I do not remember them with so much chunky ice. I couldn't even drink it with a straw. Maybe this location needs a new blender?,negative
"I usually frequent this DQ but won't again. I'm tired of paying extra for extra toppings in a blizzard to get what seems like less than the norm. Tonight was final straw, I won't be back. Seems like they just over charge for you to only get home to realize you can't even taste anything but ice cream. What a waste.",negative
Josh who works there is the best ! 10/10 I'm only coming to this diary queen. It's about 15 mins away from my house and I would rather come here than the one close to my house. Josh thank you for making my experiences great!,positive
"From the greeting to the way the word blizzard just zazzled off his tongue Delvin owned the drive through like the bank owns the car I drove through it. He brought the blizzard to Vegas circa 2007. I thought I was watching David Blain when he flipped that blizzard upside down and all the ice cream cowarded in fear of following the natural laws of gravity. Delvin Lord of Ice, Savior of the drivers through I hope the eyes of management see your true hidden late night glory shining through like my phone receiving a text through a tight pair of jeans. Delvins thorough devotion to the creaming of ice insured my cheese cake chunk mining experience produced adequate rewards even when deep below the depths an inferior Dairy Queen would say no such things dwell. May we meet again Delvin Lord of Ice.",positive
I like this place they had great customer service and the manager was super nice and helpful unfortunately didn't get his name but he had glasses thank you dude,positive
"The drive through lights and all the business signs we're off so the place looked closed when I pulled up at 9:50. It's a good thing the hours in this Yelp page show it should be opened until 11:00 PM. I would be very upset if I were the owner and the manager decided to turn off the exterior business lights an hour early. The drive through was empty when I pulled up and it was 6 deep when I left, I guess anther customers saw me in the drive through and decided it might be open. The service was fast and the ice cream was delightful.",negative
Worst Dairy Queen I have ever gone to. The manager was sour and really disrespectful when taking my order. He seemed annoyed by me even placing an order. I ordered a blizzard and it didn't for at least 10 mins. And when I got it he didn't flip it! I didn't even want to tell him because I knew he wouldn't honor the DQ code. Never go here.,negative
"This is my first Yelp review, and I'm writing it because of marshmallow sauce. Yes, you read that correctly. I have been to this Dairy Queen location several times since moving to Vegas a few months ago (how else is one truly supposed to survive these satanic summer temperatures) and my experience can best be described as consistently inconsistent. When they get my order correct it's great, but they don't get my order right often. Most recently I repeated my order of 2 blizzards to them 4 times over the drive thru, then again once I pulled up to confirm they had heard me correctly. I was assured they were preparing what I ordered. As I pull away from the drive thru window, I bite into my blizzard to taste- vanilla. Now folks, I can assure you I did not move to Las Vegas to live a vanilla lifestyle. I ordered a blizzard with chocolate ice cream. And they forgot other ingredients that I paid extra for on numerous occasions. My tipping point with this location is when I went to order a blizzard with marshmallow sauce and the employee responded they had ""got rid of it"". Well looks like y'all got rid of our business at this location too. Now I'm not some kind of Dairy Queen, but I was a shift manager at DQ back in high school & I have to say, get your drive thru employees' hearing checked or something. If you can't handle me at my 2 ingredient blizzard request you don't deserve me at my peanut buster parfait. I'll be sticking to Yogurtland where I can add my own toppings, because if you want something done right apparently self serve is the only way.",negative
"A rare letdown the other day. I ordered their special, Halibut Puttanesca. The halibut itself was wonderful. It was flavorful, moist, and buttery. But the puttanesca was overly salty. It overpowered the subtle flavors of the fish. After the first bite, I had to scrape it off the remainder of my fish. The fried calamari and bruschetta were delicious, as usual. Service was prompt and friendly, as usual. But to have your main dish be a letdown, especially at that price, took a lot of luster off the meal.",negative
"This is one of our 'go to' places. Lots of restaurants say they have great 'Spots'. I like Spots. So, I've gotten them at a number of places. None come close to the quality of the one's here. Delicious! I usually get them with crabmeat. The wait staff is friendly, and experienced. We loved the Bruschetto, zucchini and crab cake appetizers. Any of the pasta meals are delicious. We brought our future son-in-law's parents here for our meet and greet dinner. They are from out of town. They were so impressed with the food that they arranged for the Rehersal Dinner to be held there. Enough said. DeLallo's does not disappoint.",positive
Stayed at Crown Plaza - this is a must try. Italian hubby loved the lasagna & tender meat balls. Sauce was so good. Homemade Cheese raviol were great! Even the side salad with the balsamic dressing was so tasty. A Sunday night & waiting list was an hour. Glad we found 2 seats at bar & got in & out. A definite re visit on our Chicago DC trips.,positive
"Broiled VA Spots with butter lemon sauce, salad with White French Dressing. Can you ask for anything better than this?? Great service, ambience, and very reasonable.",positive
"One of the best restaurants in the South Hills! I've been eating here for years. This is an ""old school"" type restaurant, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It's family run, clean, semi-formal, and a very nicely laid out, comfortable place to eat. Service is always outstanding, and they have a lot of long time waitresses, which speaks well of the ownership. The food leans toward Italian, which is no surprise, and it's far and away the best Italian food in the South Hills. Ravioli is excellent - try it with their authentic marinara sauce. It's a chunky type sauce with olive oil, tomatoes, and vegetables. Really fresh tasting and different. Goes great with the meat or cheese ravioli's. Also recommended is the seafood ravioli! Try it with the Tomato Basil cram sauce. Outstanding! Seafood dishes are also top notch. Love their Spots. I'm not sure if they're always available, but if they are, order them. Also have a high quality fish sandwich - I do wish they went to regular fries though instead of the thick wedge fries they serve. I've never had anything but an outstanding meal at DeLallo's!",positive
"Old school Italian ""joint"" that does not disappoint. My party primarily stuck with the restaurant's specialities. My husband's red clam sauce was delicious and my spots with crabmeat were delectable. We'll certainly return.",positive
"Yikes. If you're looking for an exciting meal where you are assaulted verbally and physically, I recommend you try this place. Although the food is run of the mill Italian, the attitude of the owner (mimicked of course by at least some of the staff) takes this to a whole other level. He is rude, frightening, and shameful. Be careful. When we used to live in the Burgh we tried this place at the rave reviews of neighbors. Many locals swear by this place. We thought the food was good (not great or stellar) and the service was abrupt but ok. On returning recently for a conference, a group dinner with colleagues was overpriced and turned disgraceful by horrid behavior from the owner. I only wished we still lived in the area so I could warn unsuspecting neighbors.",negative
"This place is soo so good- Old school Italian that never disappoints. I've had their pastas, seafood, and ravioli, which is a specialty of theirs apparently.... and everything is always delish! Their Virginia spots is my mother's favorite, definitely recommended with the lump crabmeat add-on. I especially love that entrees are served with a small side of pasta. The dining room is cozy and quiet, but not weird quiet, and staff is super friendly and welcoming. They also have lots of prepared foods and frozen ravioli available to purchase.",positive
"Another reason I miss living in Scott Township, being able to come here on a whim. It's been around since I was a kid and a South Hills mainstay. Shopping at the mall always means lunch or dinner. Ravioli and wedding soup are authentic and remind me of my Nana's kitchen. If you order the chicken Parmesan I suggest getting it to share with someone else because the meal is huge enough to share and still take some home. Salads are my lunch favorites. Lettuce is crisp and all the veggies are fresh.",negative
"We eat here almost weekly. The food and service is very consistent. My husband says the spots are the best in the city. I think their blackened salmon is the best also! We love the balsamic dressing, I could probably drink it. For light lunch options we often get the trio-salad or the chopped salad. For dinner I always get the Chicken Maremana (gluten-free).",positive
"The service is really underwhelming, unless Dave is working at the desk. The quality of the food has diminished over time and the wait staff work hard to fix problems. If you're planning a special night, find a different place.",negative
"Excellent food, reasonably priced, great atmosphere, great service. Scott waited on us and he was amazing. Expect a long wait on Saturday night. We arrived at 630pm without reservations, and were able to put our name on a list and were told to come back at 8pm. We were back at 740pm and were seated. Well worth the wait, though, but I would recommend reservations.",positive
"Excellent Italian cuisine! Love their red clam sauce with mussels, best I ever had. Pasta Scoglio (seafood) is delish! Excellent attentive service, good portions and reasonable prices. Make a reservation the place is busy!",positive
"This food was so good. I came in for lunch and was so pleased. When I walked in, I didn't know what to expect- the interior, while clean and tidy, was definitely a little dated and the clientele was far from young. This place was amazing- the food was awesome! I had the Italian hot sausage sandwich, which came with a choice of fries, coleslaw, or soup. I went with the wedding soup and loved it so much I picked up a quart of it to go. The sandwich was great- really nice authentic homemade Italian sausage and fresh bread. My grandmother had coleslaw with her sandwich and remarked on how fresh it was as well. I live in the North Hills and will definitely be making a trip back here to eat again! I highly recommend it.",positive
"All I can say is WOW. DeLallo's catered a small outside birthday party for me. They were on vacation but took my emails and when we went to pay they had every detail right. The beef was prime rib, the portions generous and all the details. Included was paper products, coffee and even half and half-I hate powdered creamer. I had so many compliments. I'm from California but came to Pittsburgh for my birthday.",positive
"Wow! Just wow! Who goes to an Italian restaurant and orders prime rib? We do! It was DELISH! Very tender and flavorful! Totally worth coming back for! Okay, now for Italian food. The lasagna was pretty much the BEST that we've ever had. It was definitely a legit homemade recipe and very fresh! Layers and layers of amazing flavor! If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely come here again!",positive
Delallos always seems to get it right. We celebrated several birthdays this evening and everything we ordered was fabulous. Mike our server and his assistants were very attentive and we never had an empty glass. Steak cooked perfectly. Appetizers were all fabulous. Chicken Delallo was divine! And as always the Virginia Spots with crab were Spot On Superb!,positive
A bit expensive but the food was great and the service was even better. The pasta to fish was c enjoyed by everyone and we'll be going back again.,positive
"We don't go out for dinner much...Why? I'm very critical when paying premium prices for mostly sub-par food! Well tonight we had the BEST dinner from start to finish we have had in a very long time! DeLallo's in Bethel Park, Chef Reggie and the wait staff have their game down to a science! One dish was better than the next...I opted for the perfectly prepared prime rib, my partner was a bit more adventurous ordering the Barramundi...they have outstanding Italian Wedding soup, perfectly prepared salads and main courses that are to die for! Even the basket of bread they brought to our table was delicious. We finished the meal with a great cup of coffee and the Chef's house made Tiramisu... I have passed this restaurant a thousand times, never venturing inside until this evening...Wow have we been missing out! We have found our new favorite restaurant...which by the way is only a mile and a half from our home...prices are good, food is outstanding you can't go wrong!",positive
"Another reviewer summed it up perfectly - not a date-night place, but solid, on-point red-sauce-Italian, dated decor (but impeccably clean) waitstaff that's been there forever and knows most of the clientele, the exact place you want to go for spaghetti and meatballs, beans and greens, and homemade cheesecake. You'll have enough food left for lunch the next day and you'll leave feeling cozy.",positive
"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for delicious italian food and our expectations were met at DeLallo's! My boyfriend ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and I had linguine pasta with lump crab meat, plum tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and oil. Both meals were delicious and filling! I ordered a strawberry shortcake to go which was also really yummy :)",positive
Beyond impressed. I've driven by this restaurant countless times and thought it was a deli. The food and service were outstanding. I had the chicken parm and the portion was huge for 18 bux that included soup/salad and a side. This may be my new favorite Italian restaurant in the south hills.,positive
"This is my second time here. But it's my first time eating ravioli. Sharon recommend me to eat cheese and meat. I like meat better. I'll come back for the lobster ravioli. I really like it here the environment is nice.Sharon the bartender/waitress it's very friendly. She make me feel comfortable, and I felt very relaxed when I'm there enjoying my dinner. She's the best waitress.",positive
Customer service at the ownership level is extremely poor. Reservations are ignored in favor of friends who walk in. The food is good -- but do you want to wait an extra 45 minutes after your reservation time? Do you want to watch others without reservations stroll to tables while you dodge the kitchen's swinging doors? Pass on this place...there's plenty of others nearby that deliver delicious food AND quality service.,negative
"DeLallo's is simply THE best Italian restaurant in all of the south hills area. I cannot overstate how amazing their food is..it's fresh, delicious, and the staff is always courteous and attentive. We honestly must eat here at least 3-4 times a month. If you are looking for authentic, flavorful, and high-quality Italian food, then you must give these guys a try. Their fried zucchini appetizer is out-of-this-world amazing! The zucchini is hot, crispy, well-season and never greasy. And it's served with a side of their famous marinara. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little taste of Italy before their meal. For a main course, I'm always torn between my two favorite meals: the Chicken DeLallo and the Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken DeLallo is a chicken breast stuffed with crab, prosciutto and an Italian cheese with a white wine sauce. And the Chicken Parm is always cooked to perfection! It's crispy, yet moist on the inside and their marinara sauce is just absolutely amazing. For dessert: my family always get's the Tiramisu. You must try the Tiramisu, I'm so serious. It's totally the trifecta to a complete meal at DeLallo's. The service staff goes above and beyond their duty. Our waiter, whose name I'm blanking on (and I apologize, because you totally deserve a raise) was amiable and attentive. Overall the best customer service I've seen in years! Recommendation: call ahead for reservations. This restaurant is extremely popular every day of the week, I swear, unless you arrive just as their opening you'll likely have to wait for seating. 10/10 would definitely recommend!",positive
We had dinner there Friday night and it was very good. The walleye special was delicious. My wife had a steak and it was perfect. The lobster crab bisque was also very good. The sever was excellent. He was very attentive and took care of all our needs. I would recommend this restaraunt for anybody. I will be going back.,positive
"Rude, Unprofessional, Pompous, Aloof owner! Two friends and I visited this establishment this evening, never again! Long story short, one of my friends ordered something and after being sent back twice, was still wrong. Our waitress was no where to be found, therefore, we asked for manager who is actually the owner, waste of time. He didn't listen to problem,was very abrupt, argumentative, and asked if she wanted something else. By this time the rest of party was done with meals and would have been the third time our friend would wait for a meal. No apology, no free dessert, nada, just an attitude and abrupt, I suppose in his little kingdom the customer is never right, only he is. Shortly afterwards, he was talking to a table with two of his loyal subjects about us since he was clearly pointing to us and the slick guy at table was talking with hand on face like a baseball coach discussing strategy on the pitching mound, was so obvious, juvenile, and pathetic with imp like behaviors. I've been here before, food is just ok, nothing outstanding, however, will never be back again, and will share this debacle with everyone I know.",negative
"Una sera in DeLallo's DeLallo's is a classy, homestyle Italian restaurant with white shirted, black bottom waiters and a roomy interior. An evening at this fine restaurant begins by entering the doors and you will see the hostess to the left and see a wide expanse of restaurant. You go to the right and you enter the bar. You go straight down the bar, hang a right and that's where we sat on Saturday with quite a few other tables. My dad and I were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and my uncle made us reservations for DeLallo's. I was excited to visit after reading the menu in the car ride up. Th evening continues with your water glass being promply filled and will remain filled throughout your meal. The waitress comes to take orders, and the evenly paced meal begins with the ordering of our appetizers and meals. The menu is varied, but thorough and I had the impression that they would do a good job with anything you order. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the greens and beans for appetizers. The mushrooms were cooked well and stuffed with crab meat and sat in a light lemon butter sauce. The beans in the greens and beans were perfectly cooked and were dressed in a garlic slightly buttery sauce that is also good for dipping bread in. The bread came slightly after and it was fine. It was soft and thick, but it was like a thick sandwich bread (I wasn't too impressed with that). I ordered their ravioli for my entree and I could choose a salad or soup to go with it. I choose the Italian Wedding Soup and it was quite tasty. The pasta and vegetables were cooked well and sat in a flavorful broth with tiny meatballs. I possibly could have had a big bowl of soup as my meal! It was delicious. I ordered the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The ravioli were cooked well, the cheese had a good texture and the meat sauce had a good flavor of spices; extra red pepper never hurt anyone though! Overall, a delightful way to spend a Saturday night. The Evening Breakdown, The Food: Very good. I felt a lot of care went into the food and the soup was really good. Honestly, everything was really good. The Experience: Very good. The waitstaff was attentive, the atmosphere was nice, the bathrooms were clean. The Value: Well, my ravioli was $13 if I recall, the appetizers vary in price depending on what you get. For the classy type of restaurant DeLallo's wants to be, I think the prices are fair and just. Would I return?: If I was in Pittsburgh and my uncle wanted to go again then sure! 5 stars?: I can't think of any reason to give them 4 stars. DeLallo's does a good job and if you are thinking about giving them a try after a visit to South Hills Village, I think you'd be glad you did. Grazie!",positive
"The food here is fresh, homemade, delicious. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Nice ambience. Had the homemade cheese ravioli - very good and husband had eggplant parm - also very good. The seafood chowder ws among the best we've had in the Pittsburgh area. Probably need reservations on weekends. Definitely, we will be going back. Lots of different items on the menu that we'd like to try.",positive
"Great food. I love these neighborhood gems where the wait staff recognize customers, and they have employees who have worked there from the very beginning. A+ on the wedding soup. A+ on the broiled spots with crab meat. Fresh food for a reasonable price. You can't beat that.",positive
C'est une ambiance assez traditionnelle qui ressemble aux grandes chaînes de déjeuners. Rien d'exceptionnel sur le menu et les prix sont quand même assez élevés. La qualité et la quantité des plats est bien. Service un peu long mais les gens sont souriants. Les gaufres étaient très tendres et les fruits assez frais. Le café est à volonté et ils remplissent régulièrement. La terrasse est couverte au plafond et sur 1 côté donc pas de problèmes pour la pluie. C'est familiale donc ne vous gênez pas pour emmener les enfants.,positive
Found this restaurant on yelp and couldn't have been happier with the food and the service. Great selection on coffees and espressos. Almost every dish is served with a beautiful assortment of fruit. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice which was delicious and refreshing. Definitely get a side of toast- totally worth all the carbs!,positive
"Went there on a Saturday. Food made me think of a diner. Decor is old and needs to be renewed. The obodum Omelette is rally good. The potatoes on the other hand were too salty and it looked like the toasts had been drenched in butter. When bitting in the toast, you could feel the butter coming out of the bread. And the fruits are decorations. They are so small that there's not even half a portion of fruit in the plate. The bacon was not cooked enough to my taste but I forgot to ask for it well done. I'm only giving it 2 stars because breakfast is something that is pretty simple and hard to miss. But they managed to miss half of it.",negative
"I have been here 4 or 5 times. I find it worn out and in great need of a refreshed decor. The food is okay, equivalent to a standard dinner. Over priced, not a good value. I will return only if they make sweeping changes.",negative
"Dans le coin, c'est le plus rapide, moins guindé des déjeuner. On y vas pas pour une expérience culinaire mais pour un deux oeuf bacon classique. Service rapide et courtois. Attention: en saison de touriste peut être bondé.",positive
"Simple breakfast place in a cozy environment. I rarely dine at breakfast restaurants and tend to find them all comparable. Great for big portions, bacon, eggs and toast type meal - I don't think I saw pancakes on the menu though which was disappointing. Only thin crepes or waffles. My ham and swiss cheese omelette was tasty, and very generous with the cheese, however the egg was dry. The fresh pressed orange juice was also too sour for my liking. The highlight was the toast, thick, moist buttered bread topped off with my choice of honey and jam. Portion and price wise, most things off the menu are affordable however 5$ for a glass of juice seemed like a little much. I wouldn't come here every weekend, but it's good for a home style breakfast if you're on vacation.",negative
"Le Obodum est un petit restaurant chaleureux et convivial, se situant entre le Cora Déjeuners et le Tutti Frutti. Nous y avons déjeuné lors de notre séjour à Saint-Sauveur. Les plats étaient corrects, mes oeufs étaient bien brouillés, et la grosseur de l'assiette était raisonnable. Cependant, moi qui aime bien les fruits, il n'y en avait que 3 maigres tranches dans mon assiette ; une petite tranche de cantaloup, une petite tranche d'ananas et une petite tranche de melon miel. Les prix étaient un peu élevés pour ce qu'il y avait dans l'assiette. En général, les lieux étaient propres, mais le service était un peu long. Cela nous a permis de discuter un peu en lisant le journal et en attendant la serveuse qui avait, il faut bien l'avouer, un charmant sourire.",negative
"With the political climate the way it is I was almost hesitant to go further north and have to deal with all the french that refuse to speak English. It's a good thing that I've perfected the art of ordering my 2 eggs over easy, bacon well done, with white non buttered bread. When we walked in we were waiting to be served and the hostess overheard my husband and I speaking English so she gave us English menus. We flipped the pages a few times trying to decide what to to eat and I settled on my above mentioned breakfast while the kiddo had a fruit platter and the hubby a breakfast club. The waitress was very sweet and tried her damnest to speak English while we tried to reply in French. She saw my two year old getting a bit antsy so she brought her a coloring book with crayons. The food was very good and the house fries had some really good seasoning. I found the place pricey though for what you are getting. 10.95$ for two eggs, a few strips of bacon, with house fries and ""Fruit"" which consisted of a slice of cantaloupe and pineapple. 7.95$ for a fruit cup. Literally, it wasn't a place of fruit with english cream or anything. It was a tiny bowl that you serve a single scoop of ice cream in... .then again we did go up north to a tourist trap.",negative
"Worst place ever!!!!!!! Both the service and food are terrible. The taro slush tasted like ice water, and the mango crepe cake was all frozen and hard like ice tube. I told the server and and a guy from the kitchen (probably the boss?) that i wished to add a bit more flavor to my drink because it was literally tasteless. Initially, they questioned my word - tasteless, and did not apologize for their bad drink and took it away. I thought they would make me a new one or at least put more taro powder or even sugar in it, but no. They pour the old thing back into the blender and added more ice? Excuse me? because it turned out even worst then before??? I spoke mandarin to them so Im sure that they fully understand what I asked for, but you put more ice in??? UNBELIEVABLE!!! When we had enough and decided to leave, we told them that the drinks is bad (and they are like 3.99 each, not worth the money at all), and they said nothing...wow, I was shocked. And of course, we waited for 5 minutes for the card machine to work, cuz we didn't bring cash. And for the entire waiting time, they were so quiet like they did nothing wrong. I would NEVER go back EVER again!",negative
"This place showed up after having typed ""durian"" as a search term for locations near me, so I was pretty excited of the prospects that this place offered durian desserts/drinks. Tonight, I was highly disappointed when I walked all the way here to find out that it wasn't opened according to its store hours. :/ It was cold and snowing, so yea, I'm a little bitter about it.",negative
"It would be more of a 2.5 stars but decided on a 2 star because I asked myself, would I want to come here again? The answer is probably no. The quality of the desserts were OK, standard desserts. We also ordered the popcorn chicken which was good. The thing is the portions of the desserts were very small!! So the desserts are priced above average and they gave you less. Not worth it in my POV. Maybe the decor and setup of the restaurant have something to do with it too... Throughout the entire night, the staff were cleaning their dishes and utensils at the front with loud clinking noise. This kind of thing is usually done behind the scenes. So they are not professional at all. It really ruins the mood and ambience if you are chatting with friends. The pluses: the staff were friendly and nice. Convenient location. Juicy popcorn chicken.",negative
"I got the durian pancake delivered but I'm quite disappointed just as I was disappointed at most of their other food, the servings are way too small in my opinion. For this pancake the inside is barely filled with barely whipped cream, it's so empty. Along with that I also got pop corn chicken which was okay, their milk teas too watery, cumin beef and green pepper on rice was the most disappointing, there wasn't a single piece of green pepper. Hong Kong style rice roll tasted okay but it wasn't a hk sauce, it actually tasted more japanese. The only thing I was pretty satisfied with was their Taiwanese minced pork on rice.",negative
"Came here because this place closer for me compare to Sugar Marmalade for chinese desserts. This place is the usual asian café but with bad interior design... Like they didn't even bother to make the place look special. But whatever I come here for the food and dessert. I've been here 3 times since it opened last weekend (nov.8th, 2014) I've tried their: - ?????? (house special mango black grass jelly mixed) 6.49 not bad but since mangos are not in season mango cubes were a bit sour. Mango Mixture base was decent. - ???? (popcorn chicken rice) 7.49 I'm pretty sure some of their food is premise and then microwaved but most tea shops are like this to be honest. At least popcorn chicken is freshly fried. It comes with half of a marinated egg and some cooked lettuce, pretty good for a casual meal) - ????????(Taro sago mixed and Pearl delight) 4.49 I really like this one! The pearls are sweet and chewy and taro tastes good with the coconut milk and sago mixture. - ???? (supreme mango pancake w/sundae) 4.99 good portion. I had a bite of this from my friend, yum! Would recommend all of them especially the pearl delight! The coconut milk was creamy, pearl was cooked just right and the sago fitted well with the dessert. I ordered that twice out of the three times I went along with popcorn chicken on rice. I was hungry okay! Overall, I think this place is worth trying due to proximity. No need to come a long way for this though. Compare to other Chinese dessert places like Dessert kitchen and double Ming dessert Dessert guru is just average tasting and priced a little more (like $0.50-$1 more)",negative
Horrible. Had second thoughts when I didn't smell smoked meat outside or even when I first walked in. Should have listened to my instincts.,negative
Tried for the first time last night. Surprisingly not very busy for 7 pm on a Friday night. Might be that it's not the best location. That doesn't matter though they had good food for a good price. Servings were good size. The fried okra was just about as good as the authentic okra one would find back in the southeast states. The staff was friendly and eager to answer any questions. Really cool about the souvenir cups and complimentary ice cream.,positive
the sauce is wayyyy to spicy to much pepper in it burn your mouth type of spicy and for what your paying you figure you would get bigger portions but instead you get these tiny little portions that made me ask the driver if my order was correct thats how small the portions are oh well i guess you live and learn,negative
"I can only sum it up in one word, GROSS!!! The meat was cold and didn't taste like barbecue at all, the beans are canned and the buns were cold and hard, good thing I had a groupon and it was pretty much free but will never go back! Also the ""manager was coughing and hacking away right next to our food, can I say GROSS again?",negative
Well the highly anticipated barbecue rib place was extremely disappointing went through the drive-through on three different occasions they did not have ribs and they tried to push pulled pork on me I said I was interested in the ribs and this is the third time. surprisingly and I don't know why I went back-and-forth time and they did have barbecue spareribs! They were old dry and the flavor had me needing to drink something to take t terrible taste out of my mouth I figured I wasn't going to eat them that I would give them to my dogs and to my surprise they sat there for two days my dogs did not even eat them either,negative
"Six months ago I would have rated this higher. The meat is still tasty, but this will no longer be my ""go-to"" for BBQ. The new menu (no combos, less items, no fried items) is disappointing and the pricing makes a sit-down establishment more inviting. On the hunt for a new favorite...",negative
"Ripoff!! If you like ribs, I hope you are well off. A full slab, sorry two 1/2 slabs 2 sides and a drink. $35 I should have walked out. But I didn't. They were ok but not $35. I shall never return. If you want great ribs go elsewhere.",negative
"This was my first time here. Horrible, horrible Customer Service. I get up to order and she doesnt say hi no eye contact. What do you want?? So i thought to myself ok she is having a bad day It happens.So i order and she was just chopping away and throwing meat on the floor. As Im watching her I told my husband lets go. she take a other order and just leave my food there. so i get up to the cashier and let her know that my order and can i get my sides. My food was cold by the time i sat down to eat. Im sitting there with my husband and daughter. We look around and everyone there is pissed off. My husband ask the cashier to turn some music on maybe it would help the mood in the place. I will not go there again or recommend it to anyone.",negative
"Slowest place to get BBQ food. Hell, I went in at 6:30, 7pm rolled around, and I was still standing in line. 7:10 came around, and I just said forget it and left the place. This place has no urgency to the customers. Did I mention that I wasn't the only one that left? 2 groups of 3 left the place as well. If you want to waste an hour in line, then this is the place, if not, then I would not recommend this place at all.",negative
"The food was great. However I chose Dickies because of a Restaurant.Com gift certificate and the meal packages. However when I called to place the order, the prices and selections available were not the same.",negative
"Growing up in Dallas behind one of the original Dickey's BBQ pits, I was pleasantly surprised to find them here in Mesa! I've gotten to know the staff and owner and it feels like home every time we go in. My husband and I switch up our orders each time. They have a daily special that always hits the spot when we can't make up our minds. The big yellow cups are refillable, the tea is great and the BBQ sauces are scrumptious, especially when you follow it with some free soft serve ice cream! Y'all enjoy!",positive
"I don't know if these are corporate restaurants or franchises, but in either case, this particular location is pretty bad. First of all, we went for dinner at 5 pm and after waiting 20 minutes to get to the ordering counter, they tell us they are out of brisket. WTH? What BBQ joint runs out of brisket at 5 pm? And they don't have a sign in the window or at least a chalk board when you walk in, to tell that there is no brisket???? At least 80% of the 50 or so people behind me want brisket too. OMG!!! Their order taking and prep system was designed by the 3 stooges. 3 people trying to help customers and they are trying their best, but their ""system"" is atrocious. Instead of using a production line system, each person tries to do everything. So let's start at the beginning. You order your plate -- either 1,2, or 3 meats. Let's say you want a 2 meat plate with pulled pork and smoked turkey. So the guy goes to the warmer and takes out a pork butt and a turkey breast, all wrapped in saran wrap. He pulls your portion of pork off and cuts a few slices of turkey breast; wraps the unused portions back up and puts them back into the warmer. Now the next customer wants pulled pork too, so he goes back to the warmer and takes out the newly wrapped pork butt, that he just re-wrapped 15 seconds ago, pulls off the saran wrap, and preps a portion for the next guy --- WTH? Now he does this while wearing those food server gloves, which is a good thing. But then he has to take them off to scoop the sides into little paper cups -- beans, cole slaw, potato salad, etc. etc. Then he pushes your plate to the girl at the cash register so she can ring you up. He then goes back to the meat prep station and has to put on gloves again. Now when the girl at the cash register is done ringing you up, she goes to the meat prep station and puts on gloves to help the next person in line with their order.....like I said, it's like watching the 3 stooges in action. Meats have very little if any smoke flavor. Ribs are very salty and the dry rub in not flavorful. BBQ sauces are thin and have no depth of flavor. Sides are pathetic -- coleslaw is very similar to coleslaw at KFC....I call this kind of coleslaw grass clippings from my lawnmower--chopped up bits of cabbage and lousy dressing. Beans came out of a can. Other sides are meh....but the waffle fries and onion strings are OK. And to top this all off, they have no burnt ends and no rib tips! Prices are higher than average for below average food, IMO. I know this review is critical, but other Yelpers should know that good places from the bad.",negative
"I got the three meat plate, all the meats I got were amazing!!! And the side didn't disappoint!! If your into BBQ then I would hit this place up for sure!!! Quality food and the people working here were super friendly!!! I even met the owner Tom and he was super nice!!! I will defiantly be back to this place to eat with my family and I will also be using them to cater my office party this month. Great experience",positive
"There food was usually good that is why we have returned, but each time I go the service gets worse. The girl but the cashier doesn't seem like she is all there I handed her a coupon and she took my card but never applied the coupon. After getting my card back she just walked away. The older lady is also rude. She just asked what do you want as we were just waiting for someone to hand us our food that was sitting behind the counter. We won't be returning.",negative
"Don't get me wrong now, we enjoy the food at Dickey's. For franchised bbq it really is very good, and Dickey's has a wide selection of both meats and side dishes. But if you are going to eat at Dickey's do your self a favor and choose a different location. We've been to the Power Rd. location several times now and well, the people that work here are simply consistently rude. Today it was the young man preparing the meats. He would not look up at us from behind the counter and when my wife asked if this was where we ordered, he said without looking up, ""I'll be right with you"". (It is a shame his tone can't be heard here.) He was snotty and we were bothering him. I get it, everyone has a bad day. But this location is ALWAYS having a bad day. The food is still good, so if you go be ready for rude.",negative
"I am a Dickey's regular. The food is seriously way good. But every time I come to this location, I'm very disappointed by the poor service. And I have visited this location a number of times. The people behind the counter are inept...They are completely incapable of seeing a need and responding to it appropriately. I brought my wife here for her first Dickey's experience (poor decision on my part - she's not a fan of bbq to begin with). She will probably never come back again with me. Here's a list of annoying things that happened on this visit: 1) We waited in an average sized line for a much longer than average amount of time. 2) The guy behind the counter screwed up my order after I repeated it to him twice, and he repeated it back to me. 3) I ordered a side of jalapeño beans and the girl only filled the cup half-way. 4) The tray that my food was on was filthy and greasy. 5) The restaurant was in a dire need of cleaning and upkeep...the floors were disgusting, the trash needed to be emptied, the drink fountain was gross, the bbq sauce station needed to be wiped down, and tables were not being cleared after people left. 6) The ice cream was out - the only thing my wife was excited about. 7) You might be thinking ""Maybe they were just short-staffed."" Nope. As we were walking out the door, I just happened to notice one of the employees sitting on his duff, taking a break while all of the above stated issues went unattended. This seems to only be a problem at this location. Whoever the Owner is, they seriously need to reconsider their staffing decisions. I will continue to go to Dickey's but will avoid this location whenever possible. UPDATE 4/14/15: I sent a personal message to Dickey's B. per the request in their reply below. It has been 3 weeks and I have not heard back from them. In all fairness, I have not been back to this Dickey's location to see if they have addressed the concerns listed above. But my above review will stand until I either have received a response from them or I go back to this location to see if it's any better.",negative
The service here is the slowest I have seen.. They seem to be more interested in chatting and joking with each other than serving the customers. We waited in in line for over 15 mins while one person helped one guest slowly at a time despite there being at least 4 employees behind the counter.. We walked out and probably won't be choosing this place as a lunch option going forward.,negative
The beans are the bomb! (My picky eater) Okra is my favorite & I love the variety of sauce Melts in your mouth along with ice cold sweet tea,positive
"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the fried okra and the baked potato casserole. The meat was a no go from the minute I saw the guy scraping the bark and the fat off my request for wet (or moist) brisket. The pulled pork was a weird mix of dry and mushy meat. The ribs were super salty and not very good. But before all that was the service that was SO SLOW!! I think I got two new gray hairs just waiting for him to pull out the meat we wanted. Needless to say we won't be going back. If I want good bbq, I apparently need a plane ticket home to the South.",negative
"Be ready for the slowest service in the world. The food is good, but the efficiency of getting people through the line is awful. It was like this 2 weeks ago but we gave them the benefit of the doubt....NOPE....The guy cutting all the meat isn't getting any help and is touching everything around the kitchen then touching the meat again without changing his gloves. Taylor, who seems to be the manager, is watching the huge line without helping and I can see 4 people in back standing in a circle just chatting. I have watched multiple people come and then leave because of the wait. Just got my food and was in line for 22 minutes with only 3 others ordering in front of me. The owner of this store needs to read the book ""raving fans"".",negative
"My son introduced me to this restaurant in Tucson at their Oracle location. And everything was GREAT. So, when I saw this one here in Mesa. I knew I had to stop. I was across the street at Panda Express. I now wish I had stuck with my first choice. OMG!!!! This place was a mess from the minute I walked in. I went on a Saturday around 1pm. There was no crowd or a long line. It was only a group of 3 and they all ordered the special. I waited in line about 15-20 minutes just to place my order. That was totally ridiculous. I ordered the 2 meat plate (beef brisket/spicy sausage) with 2 sides. No, a drink is not included. This was a joke, it was more like 2 pieces of meat. The sausage equaled out to about half of a sausage sliced up. Don't even get me started on what was suppose to be slices of brisket. It was 2-3 small pieces of crispy burnt dry meat. I guess mine skipped the smoker. My side dishes were the only things that were hot. I did get a piece of pecan pie for $2.95. My total meal cost me $16 bucks.This was what I ordered thinking it would be for my lunch and leftovers for dinner, WRONG!!! The portions of meat were so small, I ate it all in one setting. The best part of the meal was the fried okra and pecan pie. Yea, the ice cream is free. It should be for what you pay for the food. In the future when I want BBQ. I will make the drive down to Rudy's. Where I know the food is lip smacking finger licking good. And I will get more big bang for my buck. I will NOT be returning to this location again. Maybe they should try compensating their customers for their wait with a small drink, a cookie or something. It's all part of Customer Service.",negative
The food was okay but the service was terrible and one of the staff members was actually rude to us. My girlfriend asked to order a kids meal and treated her as though she has tried to hold the restaurant up at gun point. The food was pretty decent but the fact that we waited at the front of the line with no one even acknowledging us for 10 minutes was un acceptable. Then when we were acknowledged it was with rudeness. On top of this the the employees were fighting with each other and another patron complained and was refunded. Thank God they have free ice cream because makes even the worst experiences seem a little better.,negative
"The food here was decent, but not great. The wait was so long people were just walking out after waiting 15+ minutes just to order. We waited 20 minutes to order & were even at the front of the line the entire time, while Tommy, one of the most rude & condescending employees I've ever encountered never even acknowledged our presence. My food was cold before the fries even came out. We were pretty disappointed as we'd had high hopes for a BBQ place! The only two redeeming qualities were the ambiance due to the fun themed decor & the free self-serve ice cream.",negative
We went here last night for a date out with the kids. I was very impressed. The food was fast and absolutely delicious. My husband dragged his feet to go... but he commented multiple times how good it was. We had a family pack and had enough for our family of five plus enough for lunches for all left over. It's rare that we can get two meals out of $40 especially when going out. The restaurant was very clean and was kid friendly. I was also really impressed that the owner came out and personally went around to each table checking in on how things were. I love been treated well and enjoying a great dinner!,positive
"I'm from Texas but have lived in Arizona for 19 years. I was eating at Dickey's 30+ years ago in The Lone Star State. This BBQ has a great reputation! I stopped by for an early dinner around 4:30pm tonight. The place was very, very clean for starters. I ordered the 2 meat combo and opted for sliced brisket and the jalapeño cheddar sausage. I got mac and cheese along with fried okra for the sides. The BBQ was great! The sausage had good flavor and the sliced brisket was from the lean end. I got a little of all three of their BBQ sauces (sweet, spicy, and original). The mac and cheese was delicious and they cooked the fried okra to order (great call considering there's nothing worse than soggy fried okra because it's been sitting too long). The dinner comes with a pretty good roll but this is a BBQ place for crying out loud. Throw 2-3 slices of white bread on the side and call it a day as all great Texas BBQ places do. The only real beef that I had with the place (no pun intended) was when I opted for ice water instead of a soda/tea and was given about an 8 ounce plastic Dixie cup. Come on! Don't be that way. I didn't order water to be cheap. I ordered water because I didn't want the additional empty calories. Lose the small water cups and be the restaurant to give out normal size or even large water cups just because it's the right thing to do (the Dickey's plastic soda cups are probably 48 ounces). You can't eat at a BBQ place with 8 ounces of water and who wants to keep getting up for refills? (...and don't reply that it's a cost thing - figure it out) Ok. Enough of the soap box. The free soft serve ice cream at the end was a nice touch! The staff was very friendly. I will return one day soon and hope to give Dickey's BBQ 5 stars provided they've fixed the water cups. This franchised Dickey's BBQ location is owned by a Marine veteran and beats the heck out of Joe's BBQ. Go enjoy Dickey's for lunch or dinner today!",positive
"I tried them out because of a Groupon, I met several family members there we had a total of 3 Groupons. The place was dead, only one other family was there, went on a Saturday afternoon (4 ish). Customer service does not exists here, we were not greeted at all, the cashier was to busy texting to even look at you. We got brisket, chicken and pulled pork. The chicken and brisket were good, the pork dry. I question if they actually cook onsite as all the meat was pulled out of a warmer and was wrapped in plastic. The potato salad is disgusting, more like mashed potatoes they threw some left over stuff into. The waffle fries were pretty good, happened to be fresh which was a plus. Would not be in my top 5 places to go for BBQ.",negative
The people who work here are rude. I requested half brisket and half pulled pork (instead of just 1 meat) and they made faces like it was such a pain in their rear. The workers are just unfriendly in general. Plus this place skimps you on the meat. It's a shame because the meats are really tasty.,negative
"This place has amazing tasting food-specials every day and consistantly delicious. The fried okra is terrific,,everything we have had is great -including the (Free) ice cream-",positive
"I could see why this place has such inconsistent reviews. I can totally agree with some of the low and high reviews on here. For example, I think they really need to work on their customer service. The wait can be horrendous here sometimes especially during lunch hours. And it seems like the employees don't even bother to rush or speed up what they are doing. Everything works on their time here. Plus, the older lady (is she the owner?) is helllaaa stingy with the food. They measure and weigh every single thing here! Am I at a science lab? I mean I get it, you wanna maximize your $$ and keep the food portions consistent. But when restaurants start weighing your food items that really turns me off. As for the upsides of this place. The food is decent (ok) and they got pickles and free soft serve ice cream! YES. So yea. I'm very hesitant to give more than 3 stars.",negative
"Terrible. I was really disappointed with this place. I didn't go in with high expectations since its a franchise in a strip mall, but it was worse than expected. They were out of baked potatoes (which were the daily special), limited side dishes which were already pre-packaged, and the meat was just ""meh"", nothing to write home about. I did like the sauces bust did not like the hard, dry rolls and didn't understand why the meat plate included a raw onion!?! I was excited to have another food option near by but I don't plan on returning. If you want chain bbq nearby, go to famous daves. If you want great local bbq nearby, go to Joe's! If you want overpriced mediocre bbq, eat HERE!",negative
"Went to this food truck for lunch. The pork & shrimp dumplings were alright. Also took the bbq pork buns, almost no filling, bland taste. the food did not look like how it was pictures on the menu. The salad was just a leaf of boston with a very sweet dressing. I would not recommend.",negative
"I always take ""assorted dimsum package"" cuz I can't pick one dimsum here. Literally EVERY DIMSUM is awesome!! When I live near McGill, I used to go there twice a week. Moreover the owner is so kind! I miss this truck so much!",positive
"Juicy, meaty and delicious. The biggest shrimp siu mai I've ever seen and so wonderfully flavourful. The BBQ pork bun was also ridiculously good - very meaty and little fat (a rarity these days). Didn't try the bubble tea but my friend loved hers! Overall, 5-star",positive
"My second time to the Dim Sum truck was very disappointing. I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, steamed pork bun, mango bubble tea and coco perle. The shrimp and pork were alright - large, juicy and served hot, but they are served in the same tray as the salad. The hot salad with sweet dressing was disgusting by the time I got back to the office to eat it. The pork buns were hard and cold. I couldn't eat them. The coco perle that I loved so much the first time I had them were not chewy at all. They were nuked in the micro wave before serving them to me and became hard - very hard, almost crumbly. I couldn't eat it. Total disappointment. The bubble tea was warm - no ice and flavourless. It was the colour of mango bubble tea but was watery and really no flavour. There were about 6 bubbles (tapico pearls) in the drink total. Bummer. Lunch cost me $20. I feel really ripped off.",negative
"Definitely worth the price One of the most Reasonable priced truck with delicious food. Tried their best seller, their shrimp and pork dumplings and it was incredible. Looked more like 2 gigantic meatballs but amazing food for price Highly recommended for next season",positive
"As someone who loves Dim Sum I was excited when I came across the food truck at a random street fair. Paid $4.50 for a couple bites of coleslaw salad and two dumplings. Although I wish it had been a slightly larger serving, I have to say that their dumplings are SPOT ON. Perfect portions and just so darn delicious.",positive
Bad bad bad. first they don't have carne asada. Second they serve blain taco meat with no flavor. They charged me $11.75 for 2 tacos with rice and beans. At the airport gouging prices are to be expected. But an extra $1 for watered down salsa mad the experience worse. I will never eat here again because the food was disgusting.,negative
"HORRIBLE....don't go here...Zero stars was not an option so I had to graciously leave 1 star. The overpriced dried out chicken was the worst food I have ever eaten at a so called Mexican restaurant. No flavor at all..it was like they threw a chicken breast on a grill with onions and pepper cooked it for an hour, cut it up and mixed it with dried out flavorless rice. AVOID and go elsewhere!! The best part was leaving the place...",negative
"I believe it is true when they say flying is safer then driving. With all the advancements in aviation technology, I have even more faith, that statement is true. But is by some strange cosmic roll of the dice, I was to dine at DATG, get on a plane, then impact Terra Firma traveling at 600 knots, I would absolutely, positively not want this to be may last meal. Hell, I would rather take a Chex mix packet over this slop. I take a certain pride in living in Las Vegas. I am actually proud of your ability to get millions of visitors in and out of Sin City to have fun and contribute to our local economy. It is with a heavy heart, I find that we offer those coming to and going away in the unsecured portion of McCarran International Airport this pig slop. If I just arrived from parts unknown and have by passed what the individual terminals have to offer and am met with Don's as a dining alternative, this is a sad, sad, reflection of what our city has to offer. If I am dining with a loved one prior to them punching out somewhere else in the country or world, it is absolutely vulgar this could be our last meal together. Behind the facade of what appears to be a Tex Mex or Mexican style restaurant lays the cafeteria hell. After perusing the menu anything off the Latino menu was out of the question. Wanting to be safe, The GF (who was heading out of town) and I decided to share chicken finger and fries. Water was fluid to wash it down because charging over $3 for a fountain drink is just plain ole price gauging. The chicken fingers took over 15 minutes to be served and when they did show up the fries were barely warm. While waiting for the our ""meal"" I watched as the servers conducted themselves in a manner befitting the federal government. Imagine the attitude one would receive while standing in line at the Social Security office. Better yet.....Imagine if the TSA was serving your food! Rude, condescending, I watched one.. the order taker talked to a non english speaking traveller with ZERO compassion or empathy, while the traveler attempted to understand the establishment's menu. Back to our order, the fingers where surrounded in a breading similar to that of the Carbonate Han Solo was encased in. As previously mentioned, the fries sucked. After watching other patrons plucking who knows what off their meals while making funny faces, I told the GF to stop eating because I did not want her married to a toilet while she made her trip across the country. Dear McCarran International Airport and Clark County Department of Aviation, We can do better this. Don Alejandro's Texan Grill is an embarrassment to our community. The location is prime and surely could do better to represent our town while they are either coming or going. Ditch the small town cafeteria fell for something sparkly and that won't turn your guts inside out. You will probably make even more money with a business who gives a damn about what they serve, including the manner in which they provide it. In the end I earned a ""Maverick"" yelp badge. Though cool, it was my bad for not consorting yelp before entering. The ""Mav"" is earned by going against the grain and going someplace despite it's POOR RATING! Sincerely, Paul W.",negative

"This dining experience happened about 5 years ago so its important to keep that in mind when reading this review. As I read the other reviews it looks like nothing has changed. Here is my story: I had some time to kill so I ordered a steak and eggs. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium well. They brought me out a rare, bleeding steak. I asked the waitress if they could fix the issue. The cook, obviously irritated by my request, cooked my steak until it was black, burnt, and tough. I choked down the steak because I was starving. I paid my bill and walked out, never to return again. The place is at a very busy airport so it will always get enough traffic to stay afloat. My advice to any would-be patron is to try and avoid this place at all costs. You are better off getting some fast food or surviving on the peanuts served during your flight.",negative
"We popped in here between flights a few weeks ago. We had an hour to kill and decided to share a breakfast burrito. It was actually pretty good once we applied a liberal amount of hot sauce. I wasn't a fan of the chips, which were very dry and crispy. Tasted like salted cardboard. My favorite part of the meal was my delicious Bloody Mary. Yes, it was only 7AM, but when you're in an airport, time doesn't matter. Service was very friendly and efficient. A good place to stop in for a bite and a cocktail.",negative
"I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. It would only be worse if I get explosive diarrhea on the airplane, in which case I might reconsider recommending it to my worst enemy.",negative
"We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",negative
"Just as the rating prompt says, 'Meh. I've experienced better.' There isn't a lot of choice for a sit-down meal outside of the terminals at the airport, so I'm guessing that's the only reason why this place gets so much business. The prices were higher than I'd expect too, even if the food were better. If you're flying out, I'd recommend trying one of the restaurants near the gates in the terminals. If you're coming in, wait until you get to the city or your hotel and eat something around there. If you're that hungry, this place is no more than a band-aid on a bullet wound. A small band-aid.",negative
"Being my first trip to Vegas and this being my first food experience... Well it can only get better. Prices are typical 10-13 for a burger and fries, BUT it does not come with a drink. They gouge you $4 for a bottle of water! Bottled juice is cheaper. As for the food itself, not great, typical frozen burger patty, seasoned greasy curly fries and crummy veggies to to your burger. Want a beer? It'll run you 8 bucks for a bottle of Bud!",negative
"THIEVES! Do not pay with a credit card here! My co-worker and I ate here one day, and her husband the day before, and ALL THREE of our credit card numbers were stolen and fraudulently used. This restaurant was the only common denominator between the three of us. Unbelievable.",negative
"I'm trying to find a way to give less than one star. If Gordon Ramsey ever ate at this place, he'd take a blow torch to it after firing everybody. I've had better food in dumpsters....outside Taco Bell. Seriously, I don't expect fast food at an airport to rival something served on the Iron Chef, but do these people have any pride in what they serve at all? The employees taking the orders can't follow simple directions (like no cheese), and they aren't in the greatest mood, perhaps because they have to eat the food there. Next time I'm at McCarran airport I will look anywhere else.",negative
"How can mess up on an omelette and potatoes? This place has awful food. My friends and I were starving and of course turned into the first food place we could find at the airport. What a bust. They completely forgot my friend's order, we waited a good while for our food even though there weren't many people in the place and the food was just gross. I ordered the denver omelette and it came with some potatoes and a biscuit. I'm usually a huge fan of biscuits but not these ones. Everytime I tried to put butter on it, it completely fell apart. The potatoes had a funky taste and smell to it and the omelette (the most decent part of the meal) was meh. Not even the huge amounts of tapatio I poured onto it could save it from mediocrity.",negative
"To the mean middle-aged short-haired brunette ""lady"" who was the cashier. Dont put your anger issues out at me, the Customer. She was rude and at one point said ""Youll need to sign your credit slip, MA'AM (emphasis on MA'AM)."" I hate it when ppl say ""Ma'am"" sarcastically. As for the food, I ordered the fish and chips. It cost a whopping $11.88 total, and the small bits of ""catfish"" were overcoated in tough, overfried breading. The curly fries in contrast were soggy. Talk about yin and yang, or is it cheech and chong?",negative
"Its not quite mexican and not quite Tex Mex. What it is, is cheap quality and ground beef in everything. Terrible lack of flavor, and deep frying galore. Rice and beans are bland, salads are just iceberg chopped lettuce. Vegas airport is yet to add descent food.",negative
"Don Alejandro's used to barely qualify for a 3-star, A-OK type of place to eat in the McCarran Airport when it was a sit-down place with servers to take your orders. Looks like sometime in the past year, they have ditched their slow service in favor of a fast-food style ordering system, with the menu printing above the cash register and a drink fountain for your sodas. On this recent trip there, the food was not good at all, and they also took a long time to figure out how to enter my order at the cash register, after fumbling around with it. When they finally entered it correclty, they charged me for two orders, and then took another 10 minutes or so to sort it all out. People in line behind me were very upset. My recommendation here is to not touch this place with a ten-foot pole. It's gone seriously downhill, from a barely acceptable restaurant. Prices are in the $10 to $12 range for a sandwich, with sub-par fast-food quality. I would rather just eat at a major fastt-food place. Avoid at all costs!",negative
"I suspect anybody who eats here does so because of the limited places to eat outside the security check at the airport. This was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten at. The fish and chips consisted of greasy breading that enclosed very small pieces of fish that were overcooked. Chips were not even French fries much less English chips but potato chips and these were half wet and half stale. I assume all of them were very stale and that somebody with very wet hands put them on the plate. It was all inedible. My wife had a stale tuna croissant. She also received stale potato chips with half of them wet. This is a restaurant that can't even serve stale potato chips without making them worse. Total waste of money and inedible. Deserves a zero, not a one.",negative
"I don't typically post reviews on Yelp however this meal was so bad I decided to go out of my way to post a warning to others out there who may be contemplating this restaurant. I had a 2 enchilada combo, my husband had a burrito and we also ordered chips, salsa & guacamole with 1 soda. Our total was $32.00 for the meal and we both agreed the food did not taste good nor did it sit right in our stomachs on our flight home. While this was a convenient and quick meal spot, I wouldn't recommend eating there if you dont have to.",negative
"This is for breakfast only. The lunch looks good. I got a Denver omlet. A little pricey at almost $12 for the omlet, biscut and McDonald's type deep fried hash browns. So salty I could only eat a little and leave. Won't eat here again for breakfast. Maybe lunch is better.",negative
"Wow! It is worth giving it a try before the flight. I had two hours before my flight departure so I decided to look for a place to have lunch. I have seen Don Alejandro's Texan Grill at the McCarran Airport terminal D, but I always felt the appearance was a bit trashy so I expected the food and the service be the same. I was wrong those ladies work very hard to please their customers. The food is average but acceptable for the price. I have to comment on the hostess though, she looked so lost and out of place that for the moment i gave it a second taught. Very promptly I was asked by a very polity lady what i wanted to drink. I paid attention to all of the servers a group of ladies that do nothing but work hard and please customers. The food was good for the price and the guacamole was outstanding. Beyond my expectations for an airport restaurant.",negative
"The first two times I saw Alejandro's at McCarran Airport, I was in a hurry to catch my flight. I did notice a line for this place both times, and the aroma was good. Later in CA, I check Yelp for reviews and they were not stellar for a place that always seemed packed. Finally, I got enough time to try their food and I have to agree with the lower grade tone of the reviews. It's not as good as it smelled or looked. I was never served chips and salsa during my whole visit. The fajitas was salty like it was cooked in sea water. It's sad to say that places like Chili's, Friday's or Applebee's got better fajitas than this place when every from the waitress's and the cooks were immigrant Hispanic. Only three lousy tortillas came with the order and the steak was tough on the molars. To make matters worse there was a hair in the salsa. The whole experience made me wander why this place even had a line of customers the first two times I seen this place because the food was disappointing. I guess being one of the first restaurants as you entered the airport help create the allure, furthered along by having their open grill aroma seep into the airport walkways. Not many airport establishments can boast of having an open grill that lets their aroma go into the walkways. Generally, mall foodcourt quality comes to mind when considering airport eateries. Skip this place, don't let the aroma or lines of gringo's fool you. Try the Jose Cuervo Taquilera instead. They got more refreshing food than this place. I am deducting another star for having a hair in my salsa, not being served any chips.",negative
"Along the way to the security checkpoints, most travelers to McCarran Airport will almost always pass by this little Mexican gem of a restaurant. Its usually the one with the most people during rush hour and hard to miss with its Texan / Southwest rustic exterior. Service is usually quick to greet and seat, even though there may be a small wait time of 5-10 minutes. Seating is vast but the one to two person tables far outweigh the group sized ones, understandably because its a stop for most travelers on the go. When considering that most airport food is typically bland and overpriced, at least the food here is relatively edible, if not good on a hungry day. A lot of Tex-Mex goodies are here from enchiladas, flautas, various burritos, quesadilla appetizers and a sauced up juevos rancheros. Unfortunately, that's about as deep as the menu goes and variety doesn't seem to be their strong point. Prices can get a little steep when considering a small order of taquitos can run one as much as $9. In the end, when considering the alternative fast food joints that exist in virtually all major airports, this place is not a bad place to settle for the mid-afternoon meal. Tex-Mex snobs should stay away or go with the flow here.",negative
"When you're nursing a hangover and dreading the security lines, this isn't a bad place to go and get mentally prepared for the ensuing chaos. Located right before you get to any of the security checks. I had their meat and carb filled Don's skillet, which was chili beans smothered with peppers, eggs, cheese, and potatoes. It hit the spot and better yet, it killed any temptation to order any of the food on the plane. Service was quick and pleasant.",positive
"Not too bad for airport food. Of course its not no full service restaurant but the Enchiladas I had weren't too bad. The tortillas didn't seem dry and it wasn't drenched with too much sauce. I was able to eat the entire thing off the plate, but I wasn't too sure if it was because I was feeling slightly buzzed from the drinks I had before we took the cab to the airport. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla...Yeah never having that. It looked like all shreded chicken with no cheese....HMMM delicious NOT.",positive
"Been here maybe 4x in total and all I can say is, I love the authentic Korean feeling and food, ambience, etc.. despite the waiters' limited English ability, the pork potato soup is good. Altho I see only a few potatoes on it last time I visited. I always order that with spicy pork stir fry and a side of rice. I heard the chef learned his skill whilst in the army. I like the owners friendliness but as what other yelpers suggested, they should provide side dishes as I only recall a minuscule green salad for a side when I went there. Sketchy place indeed coz it's right by Mac's but it's worth the trip regardless of the hardship in finding a parking space.",positive
"Can a restaurant be good and bad at the same time? This one can. My Korean bbq pork bulgogi was good, lots of tasty meat over veggies. My friends mild heat level squid and pork dish was fluorescent red with chili and inedible. The waitress, who it was difficult to communicate with, would neither comp the dish or ask for it to be remade. She insisted on being paid every penney for it, including the tax which she had not broken out on a handwritten bill. As we left I told her again the chef should have remade the dish. No reaction.",negative
Fast service and I love the food I ordered. Washroom smells clean but looks weird though. I enjoyed my meal and staff is really quick but understand a little English only,positive
"This place is a hole in the wall, but not in a good way :(. First let me say that I have relatively low standards for fanciness of a setting. I am that friend my friends have to slap away food I'm trying to salvage according to the five second rule. But Don Day looked really run down on the inside. Even though I love holes-in-the-wall this place's stools were falling apart and the place was tiny in a cramped way. I had bibimbap as always but it lack lustre. It was the kind of vegetarian bibimbap that is basically just rice + what is normally a side dish + an egg. Speaking of side dishes, there were none, which is another big con for me because what is Korean food without the side dishes?? My friend had the giant ox bone soup which was definitely meant for two people. There wasn't a lot of meat on the bones though so I feel like you're mostly getting broth and bones. I don't know a lot about the value of meat but I'm pretty sure that's not really worth it. If you're downtown and looking for Korean food, I recommend going to one of the several options in Chinatown instead.",negative
"Didn't know what to expect going in, but we were welcomed by friendly staff and I was immediately put to ease. The food was delicious and our server was constantly refilling our tea. The only negative was the very cramped and uncomfortable seating.",positive
"Very very bad service. We went to this Korean restaurant tonight and ordered a large pot, when the lady opened the gas cooker, the gas was explosive burning. The fire is so closed to our face, but nobody hurt luckily. They didn't apologize to us and just ignored us, we waited beside at least 5 mins and they served another new group people came in, it seems they forgot us. This restaurant is so dangerous, the chair is unstable, and the gas cooker is easy to explosive burn, the most important their waiter didn't know how to operate a gas cooker in right way. We won't come in again.",negative
"Food: 5/5 Ambiance: 1/5 Service: 5/5 Pretty bomb-a$$ pork bone soup! This place doesn't win many points for their décor or cleanliness with its wobbly tables, worn-out stools and dirty walls and floors. I can ignore these facts because the pork bone soup is that good. The ""small"" comes with 5 dino-sized bones that you gotta get down and dirty in to get all that juicy meat off. In addition, we ordered the spicy pork and a side of rice. Only thing lacking is that this place doesn't give you the complimentary side dishes which would've been a pretty sweet addition to an epic meal.",positive
"This place is a total dive. Dirty walls, floor and ripped up old greasy stools with poor lighting. If this sounds like were you'd like to enjoy a meal then here it is. Don't get me wrong there are dives with amazing food that will make you overlook the terrible setting. However this is not the place. With the poor ventilation and constant cooking, your clothes will smell like everyones dinner that night. Service was friendly and food came out quick. Maybe if we had another dish it would have been better?",negative
"After traveling in Korea, I am always in search of authentic Korean restaurant. I should highlight the fact that I am looking for both authentic food and ambiance. Don Day hits both targets :D . This joint is a true whole in a wall hidden behind LRT lines. The opening hours is somehow random and you should try your luck if you are in the neighborhood (Officially 5pm to midnight). As soon as you enter the restaurant, you will feel like being in Korea. Almost no English sign and no English speaking customer which is always a good sign for me. Also, it is not the cleanest restaurant in town which again reminds of typical restaurant on Seoul :D. We ordered the spicy pork and squid with rice(30$ enough for 3). The food arrived in a big skillet raw which was placed in front of us on the hot burner to cook. Also to wash the spicy food down we ordered Suju. The food was super spicy but the type of spicy that you like to keep eating. What I recommend to do is at the end of the meal, dump a bowl of rice on the hot skillet to soak up all of the juices. The rice will also create a crust which in my opinion is the most delicous part of the meal. So next time you are in downtown looking for some adventure I highly recommend this place. If you are patent enough to get over the first impressions the food will surprise you in a good way. I will definitely go back there to try other items on the menu.",positive
"I used to be a big fan of Don Day. I always told anyone who wanted to have good authentic Corean in Calgary, to go to Don Day over any of the usual Corean BBQ suspects (Koreana, Seoul BBQ, Bow Bulgogi, Korean Village). Instead of trying to be everything for everyone, Don Day is more of a tavern for folks who want to drink soju, get loud while eating pork intestine and have some stew. You will likely smell of the food when you leave and I dig it like that. Perfect conditions for a cold night in Calgary. They were best known for Gamja Tang - (), which for the uninitiated, is a hearty potato pork bone soup. I say that in the past tense, because in my most recent trip to Don Day it was pretty lacking and downright atrocious. The Gamja Tang lacked the most basic ingredient: potato! For non Coreans, Gamja () means potato. I asked the waitress, where's the potato? She replied, ""sorry, we don't serve with potato anymore."" What? You can't be serious. How can you serve Gamjatang, without the Gamja? She just shrugged and walked to another table acting like I never asked the question. So we proceeded to eat the only thing that was served with the broth: the pork bones. Now if you've had gamjatang, you'll know that the meat should tender to the point that it falls off the bone - otherwise tough meat on bones is extremely difficult to eat. Well guess what? It was tough. So tough that we literally had to leave the meat to simmer in the broth for an extra 15 minutes before we had to pick up each bone and eat with our hands. Even then after sacrificing most of the broth to simmering, the meat was so tough that it wouldn't come off using chopsticks or the spoon. Despite using the messy hands and cheeks technique, so much meat was wasted left on the bone because it was simply unreachable and uneatable. We also noticed while gnawing away that the staff was wheeling in boxes of potatoes. HELLO. NOTHING ELSE ON THE MENU USES POTATO EXCEPT GAMJATANG. WTF. If you've run out of an ingredient, you should at least let your customer know so they can choose to either order something else or at least know what will be missing in the dish they ordered. Don't pretend like you just don't serve Gamja in Gamjatang ""anymore"" and then wheel in a shipment of potato... You're liable to lose a customer and have them write a bad review. Oops, too late. Oh and the bathrooms can be simply described as sticky and wet floors with dust caked ceiling vents. I honestly didn't care about that before but might as well go full disclosure with this review. There's lots of Coreans in Calgary now. Why is it so hard to find decent Corean joints in Calgary?",negative
"The food here is sub-par. For the money the portions you get is very small. We ordered chicken and was given chicken heart meat. Most dishes have more onions than meat. Overall, the price at this place is in line with out restaurants, but you get less food and eat in a poor environment. Save your money and go elsewhere.",negative
"I was a little apprehensive at first, the restaurant looks like some illegal shop. But we decided to be brave and wow - what a find! The prices are excellent and it has real character. Everyone there looks like they are having a great time - just a little place with hotpot and pictures all over the wall. We tried a tofu and pork soup with rice, and a Korean pancake. Tasty stuff!",positive
"Automatic one star for not being stabbed or robbed. This place is right around the corner from the Crack Mac's, and admit it, you knew exactly where I'm talking about. The most I can call this place is ""an experience."" There's at most 10 tables, 8 of them that only seat 2. I came with a group of 4 and they were reluctant to seat us. Upon realizing none of us spoke Korean, service was impossible or near non existant. It felt like they were taking our orders anyway just to get us out asap. I've had my share of eating at hole in the wall places and usually they are really good experiences and I'm sad to say this isn't the case. Food? Was good, admittedly, but quite pricey compared to other places. Portion size was decent, and there is quite a selection. That's about their only positive. The establishment itself is tiny and unventilated. Extremely casual, wood tables with sheet metal tops, flimsy aluminum task chairs that are extremely uncomfortable to be on for more than a meal's session. Air quality just plain sucks, and everything from walls to floor is slick with oil and grease. What would it take for me to come back? Well I'd have to bring a Korean date, a sterile suit and gas mask, and no self respect. Boo urns!",negative
"A real Korean non-bbq experience. This place is geared towards a younger crowd who like spicy food and is willing to try new things. PLEASE DO NOT WEAR NICE CLOTHES HERE. The type of food and the so-so ventilation means that you will be walking around with the aroma of spices after you leave. This is the kind of place that you go eat, go home to change/shower and then head out for a night of partying. I think there might be 10 tables in the entire restaurant. It stays busy, have been there multiple times on both weekdays and weekends and it is always close to capacity, so please book ahead. By far, my favourite item on the menu is the spicy pork bone soup (first item on the soup menu). It is a delicious soup with 3-6 pounds of slow cooked pork on the bone (depends on if your order the 2,3 or 4 person size) in the soup. Warning: this dish is messy and you will have to use your hands to eat it. If this is the first time you have tried eating like this in public it can feel a little awkward but try to get over it. Almost every other table in Don Day will be eating this dish in the same way. Other than that, the spicy calamari is very tasty and well prepared, just cooked to tender without jumping to chewy and comes with a large portion of veggies. All in all, this is a wonderful place to go with some close friends for a great meal, even if the table manners wont impress a date.",positive
The best Mexican food I've had in my entire life. Everything I've had on the menu is absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend that you get down here as soon as possible and order something,positive
"I have been coming here for about 2 years at least 2 to 3 times a week and for the most part I get the same thing, A Redbull and a sandwich. Well today they were extremely busy for lunch and it was a little bit of a wait which was no problem but my unopened Redbull got warm so I swapped it out for a cold one in the cooler, then got my food and Proceeded to leave and the owners wife told me I had to pay for my Redbull (which I already had) and told me I was trying to steal it. I asked her to look at her transactions on her register and she wouldn't do it, and continued to accuse me of stealing l. I would be able to give her a receipt but she never gives anybody receipts for their transactions. I don't appreciate being Accused of stealing especially because I'm a regular, I will never spend another penny here.",negative
"Great food, friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some decent food. Don't be disuaded by the look of the outside, the inside holds great treasures.",positive
"I'm always go to Dora's but what I like the most is how nice they are, I been eating here for 4 years and this year I become a vegetarian they always do my food with out meat of course but they add beans or avocado to it and I feel like they support me even with all my crazy diets and cravings,I'm going to miss them",positive

"Phoenix sort of has this thing going on where everyone says they know the best taco shop. I honestly think Dora's Kitchen is probably One of the most overlooked taco stands in the entire city. I've stopped here a few times I didn't even realize they had a kitchen inside. I have tried everyone's ""best taco shop"" in the city and I have to tell you that this place is the very best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. What's even better is they will customize your order for you without any problems, unlike some places. It's worth the drive for lunch!",positive
I was surprised to find this place was in a corner convenient store. The kitchen was very clean and the food that came out of it was delicious. I got ground beef and shredded beef hard tacos and a chicken enchiladas platter on my second day in town which was a Tuesday. On my way to the airport on Friday I stopped and got the chicken enchiladas platter again.,positive
"Ambiance: Tiny little restaurant inside a liquor store in an industrial section of Phoenix. Has about 6 booth tables. The feel and vibe of the place is definitely rough around the edges...it's restaurant inside a liquor store after all! I'm guessing most people would be intimidated to enter or eat here. Patrons are blue collars. Food: Your typical selection of Mexican food (burritos/tacos/tortas) as well as some Greek dishes (gyros/pita chicken wraps). I had the focacia (chicken pita wrap with chipotle mayo) and it was delicious. As far as beverages you have the liquor/store at your disposal. Price: Not bad, $6.50 for the chicken wrap. Generous portions. Thought it might be cheaper but oh well. Service: Very attentive. You order your food up front, pay at a separate counter, beverages come off the shelf. Summary: I really dig places like these because it's by no means your typical restaurant. Takes a little a courage to walk in if you're not use to a restaurant like this but it's well worth it to the adventurous foodie.",positive
"Its really too bad about this place, its right near my work, quick and easy but then when the cook calls out my order rather than saying 'Sir your order is ready' he looks at me and says 'Cabron order'. Not a nice thing to call someone at all. The food does look good but unfortunately I ended up throwing it out, I dont trust people like this.",negative
"Best bean tostado I ever ate. Not your regular bean and cheese. Love the avacado, lettuce, tomato, and feta cheese. The beans were delicious also. Yummy. They also delivered to my apartment.",positive
"Dora's is a great little spot... inside a liquor store. Want to enjoy a ""40"" with your lunch? Have at it! This place is better than BYOB because you can buy anything your heart desires and it will be cold and priced reasonably. I had the chicken chimi when I went a couple months back. It was delicious and I can't wait to go again!",positive
"I purchased a coupon from restaurant.com the other week. You pay a certain amount depending on the increment and then you have to order a bill twice as much as whatever increment you got, mine was $15 so I was ready to order $30 of food. It took me that long to use it because they aren't open on weekends and they close at 5. I finally got to go today and no one was attending the register. When she saw me she came up, I showed her my coupon and she rolls her eyes and says to wait and leaves, another woman comes up and says that its old and they aren't doing that anymore, the woman tried to hang onto my coupon and I grabbed it from her. If she calls the number on there it will make my coupon invalid and I will lose the $15. my mom who was with me asked when they expire and I showed her where it said it never expires. Yea right! I can't comment on the food because after that visit I wasn't going to buy anything from there.",negative
You wouldnt be able to tell there is a restaurant from the outside but it is there and it is awesome! So glad I took a chance on this place. Every time I have been there the food is great. Love the mexican food and my buddy always gets the Greek Gyro and says it is also amazing. Would love if it was open on the weekend but it will just have to be a place for lunch on weekdays.,positive
Gave it try and super excited!!!! Hole in the wall gem! I got the Carne Asada and Egg Burrito. Huge burrito for only $5.75!!! It taste's so good!!! I will be returning and letting all my co-workers know. I hope they will cater a corporate lunch for us!!,positive
"My new office happens to be within a stone's throw of some of the best little Mexican joints in town. Due to this, I have gained about 4 pounds in the last two months and have eaten an obscene number of breakfast burritos. I like my chorizo burros, but my office mates prefer more Americanized ingredients like bacon and ham - which is why we generally wind up ordering from Dora's - something for everyone! Due to its proximity, speed and reasonable prices, we have recently started ordering lunch from Dora's. The tacos and lunch burritos are some of the best in the area, and my co-worker swears they have the best green chile around - which the owner told me they make fresh in house, and you can buy in a large side to go. Since I have been overindulging in Mexican food of late I decided to try the chicken gyro for lunch on my last visit. They were out of chicken so I went ahead and ordered the lamb, against my better judgment. The gyro was well made, on a super fresh pita, but the lamb just wasn't my thing. They also offer a Greek Salad for $5.95... so as I prepare for a couple upcoming weddings that may be my next order. The 'restaurant' is in the back of a market called ""Minute Liquor"" so you can pick up pretty much any sort of beverage you'd like to go with your meal. Cervesa anyone? It may seem a little strange to find a dining establishment located in the back of a liquor store, but the neighborhood is rife with these little combo shops and the kitchen is clean and the food is good and economical, so I can navigate the aisles of beer and chips in the mini-market to the back of the tiny shop for my lunch.",positive
"Walk in around 830am no customers Inside walk right up the the register older man is there said ""What can I get cha?"" I rambled off my order and said, ""Can I get a LARGE water?""

"I always go to dunkin for my morning brew and the food is always delicious and flavourful. However, a grumpy old man refused to give me green tea and made me change my order. He was also very snarky. Wouldn't recommend to a friend. Teach old man manners and I will come back. In addition, the drive thru takes far too long and I miss my green tea. I always got a medium green tea and I egg and cheese on a croissant. I miss my green tea. The man who took my order missed a couple items, however a nice lady corrected it and gave me what I ordered. Only 2/5 bc I expected better",negative
The First time I was in this store . It's a new store in the area . By 11:45 am there were no donuts left except for a tray of vanilla cream . They had some donut holes but when we asked where were all the donuts? They just laughed .. as if the store was closing any minute or something . There were about 7 young guys working but no one was helpful at all . Sad,negative
"Not sure how involved ownership is with this store but if they are not, they need to be... 8am on a Friday and they were pretty much out of everything. Not one bagel, hardly any donut holes and probably two muffins. How does this happen??? Thankfully there is a Bruegger's across the street. Seems every time we stop here the place is in a state of chaos.",negative
"Nice new DD. Recently opened with a brand new building. Friendly staff with a fast check out. Good DD coffee and your usually selection of donuts, danish, muffins, sandwiches. there is a drive thru and WiFi.",positive
Great customer service and welcoming!. The workers are very down-to-earth and the food is amazing. I ate the calamari for an app and as an entree i ate the blackened chicken broccoli penne pasta alfredo which is to die for! Please visit this restuarant you will not regret it.,positive
"I had been meaning to dine at Enrico's for some time but finally visited recently. The restaurant exterior is beautiful, the interior is simple and charming, and the patio is small but attractive. I dined outside on the patio. The menu has plenty of selections but none that really jumped out me. I wanted mussels but it is served with a red sauce, when asked, the kitchen said they could use a garlic and lemon sauce instead which was appealing. The pizza sizes were too large for a single diner so I opted to forego that. The calzone and stromboli were appealing but I did not like the price point. The shrimp scampi appetizer seemed amazing but the entrée size had different ingredients that did not appeal to me. However, the party seated next to me were served spaghetti that looked good and smelled incredible. Ultimately, I selected the shrimp appetizer but has an entrée size with a Caesar salad and cup of hot water. I had to request silverware and received a black cloth napkin which I liked. However, when I unraveled the napkin, it had hair and crumbs on it. The replacement was utensils wrapped in a paper napkin, which was ok but I preferred a clean fresh smelling black cloth napkin. I received the cup of water, inserted a tea bag but it never steeped. When I checked the water is was lukewarm and lipstick was on the cup. When I was finally able to reach my service I asked for very hot water in a clean cup. I receive the Caesar salad but the dressing had an overwhelming taste of mayo that I did not care for. Also, it did not have croutons and I really wish they were included. I received my entrée while I was still eating the salad. I wish many restaurants did a better job of timing the courses. After finishing the salad, I moved to the entrée of shrimp scampi. When I tell you it was a gorgeous dish, believe me. The fettucine pasta was light, the sauce was plentiful with lots of flavor, the shrimp were big and beautiful; I could not have asked for more. Also, the entrée was served with warm rolls and butter. I was in heaven and savored every bite. Although I loved my entrée, I gave the restaurant 4 out of 5 stars because my server. The server was not attentive, it seemed as though I was a bother to her, at the end of my dinner a different server came to me to say my initial server had an emergency and left which was fine because she wasn't of much help to me. The deduction of one star is also because of the salad dressing, dirty napkin, unclean cup, and lukewarm water. Will return to Enrico's, heck yeah. Do I recommend Enrico's to others, definitely.",positive
I recently moved to the Carolinas. I've been here a few times and I absolutely love it. The owners are fabulous and the food is very good. I would definitely recommend this place. It's good for family and parties.,positive
"I really expected more wirh the reviews....the waiter was awesome and the stars are for his attentive service. ...bravo. The food....well....pasta rule #1 salt the water or its like eating paste....the vodka sauce was fair...the Penne special was bland to the point i used half of the grated cheese from table shaker...and added salt and pepper and red pepper so it was ok..... Tiramisu claimed to be homemade but there was a distinct ""old fridge"" taste that may haunt me for awhile....it was not well put together lacking in the lady fingers soaked in coffee (or coffee liquor) and surely no mascapone either. Steer clear if your palate is beyond chain food fare....",negative
I've been wanting to try this place since they opened. I've heard some many mixed opinions about their food that I had to check them out. My friend and I decided to come for lunch on a Friday. We got there around 12:20pm and the restaurant wasn't too busy. We decided to sit on the outside area that was pretty nice. I chose the gnocchi and my friend the crab dip. Gnocchi is one of my favorites kind of foods so I had to try theirs. The gnocchi was hard and the sauce was acidity was way too much besides there was a hair in my food. The food my friend ordered she liked it and I tried and it was good too. When I was almost done with my meal the waitress came with my bread that she was supposed to bring with my gnocchi. I didn't even wasted my time complaining about the hair in my meal because wasn't worth it. As a matter of fact nothing was worth it in this visit. This is one of the few places I will never go back to.,negative
Caught this place by surprise. Looks brand new decided to give it a try. Very happy I did. Food was awesome service was excellent. I had clams scampi as an appetizer and penne bolognaise. Just terrific. Best of luck.,positive
Absolutely love having a independently owned restaurant (not a chain) right here in Berewick. There isn't anything I have ordered yet that I don't love with leftovers to take home. But let me just say...their garlic knots-best I've ever had. Great little snack to pick up on the way home. Staff is so nice. I hope they succeed!,positive

"I finally decided to try Enrico's tonight, after hearing mixed reviews first-hand from a coworker. I ordered the Sorrento Pasta opting for penne and added chicken. The menu pictured on yelp describes that dish as ""sautéed fresh tomatoes with garlic with our fresh melted mozzarella."" What I got was a pureed tomato sauce over penne and bland chicken that tasted like it was pre-made hours ago. I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for a meal like this in a mall food court or family diner, but to be charged $17 for this and store bought bread is a rip-off. Maybe they focus all their energy on their pizzas.....",negative
"I've gotten take out several times and overall happy to have a local restaurant here. I got the vodka pasta and it was good but they are inconsistent. Tastes different each time and had the pasta not cooked all the way once. The bread was fresh, sauce was tasty and meatballs were good and tender but lacked flavor. The Wedding soup I was not a fan of. Second time we got the Sicilian pizza. It was good my only two complaints are there was not enough sauce and it tasted a little salty. We have gotten the regular pizza and same issue super salty. I've decided won't order the pizza again. Husband had the calazone which large is a full pizza, it's huge! It's good but again nothing outstanding. I will use for last minute dinner ideas but it's an average restaurant. Though their cannolis are bomb!",negative
"We love this place! The marinara sauce is the best in the world! Good enough to eat with a spoon. The service is friendly and prompt and this place has that genuine, fresh food feel. Definitely try Enricos! You won't be disappointed.",positive
Chad and the entire staff is amazing!!! The owner his self is fabulous! So great to have this establishment in our neighborhood!! Love love!!!,positive
"Great food and service, huge portions My wife and I went here for dinner tonight. We like trying new restaurants, and I am so glad we gave this one a shot. The location is convenient and the ambience is great. It is a tad loud in there because of the concrete floors and all of the glass, but it is not a big deal. My family previously owned an Italian restaurant so I am picky when it comes to Italian food. The meal was EXCELLENT!! The fried calamari appears to be double dredged before being cooked and they were excellent. I had the Arrabiata and it had so many flavors going on at once, but they all worked great together. I am not usually even a red sauce fan but theirs was flavorful with just a great hint of spice, and the prosciutto, olives and mushrooms put it over the edge. My wife had the linguini and clam sauce. There had to be 15-20 huge clams in the shell in it still (vs. other restaurants that just used canned clams). It was flavorful and fresh and she can't wait to eat the leftovers because linguini with clam sauce is always better the next day. Speaking of leftovers....the portions are huge. We have a full serving of calamari still left, and over half of each of our dinners (which came with soup or salad). The meal total for the big app, 2 big dinners with soup/salad, 2 beers and a glass of wine was around $60. GREAT value. Can't wait to go back. A diamond in the rough and the best Italian food we have had in Charlotte (and we have been to many Italian restaurants in town).",positive
"Food is as bland as it can be. The sauce they make for their pasta comes directly from a can, same thing with all their vegetables! There is nothing fresh about made here. I gave this place 3 tries and the three times I came I left discussed with the food. It is safe to say that I am not coming here any more. Another thing, I don't know who this guys is, if the manager or owner but he has this angry face thats makes anyone feel uncomfortable and it definitely not welcoming.",negative
Be careful when go in this place they change there menu and there prices like the stock mart .. Food is just average..no effort in being consistent ..I tried to support this place because I leave in the area.. but when you show no love you get none.. they'll be out of business soon with this type of operation..,negative
"This was a nice little Italian place. I'd had a craving for Italian and decided to give this place a try. The menu is pretty extensive, most of your common dishes with some surprises. I started with an order of calamari. They were good. No complaints, but the marinara sauce that comes with it was delicious. It's so good you'll want a bowl of it by itself. They also bring out rolls to start the meal. I wish they would have been warm or another type of bread better for dipping. For dinner I ordered the chicken parm. It was classic. The chicken was nice a crispy and then topped with sauce an cheese. I also added a side of meatballs - the order comes with three and these were definitely the star of the evening. They packed so much flavor! And they tasted even better on the second day. #winning Overall, this is a pretty solid place. I look forward to coming back, there were a few dishes that I saw come out the kitchen that I can't wait to try!",negative
"The Italian foodie food snob is here to say: four stars!! Whoohoo! A good place for Italian food in Charlotte-rare and hard to come by, because the south is not where it's at for Italian food. I came on a Saturday night and it was steady, but not crowded. We were sat and greeted right away. The service was meh...the waiter seemed a little out of it and slow. He got a few things on our order wrong, which was slightly annoying, but tolerable. I ordered eggplant parm and meatballs. It comes with bread and a side salad. Also we tried the calamari for an appetizer. The calamari was good, the marinara for dipping was up to my standards and even had chunks of garlic in it. I really enjoyed the marinara further on my main dish. The flavor is perfect. The eggplant was nice and cheesy, fresh and hot. The pasta was cooked well. I am a big fan of the meatballs, they were delish! The salad and the bread weren't bad. The bread was a little dry. Overall a good experience and I liked the food a lot.",positive
Went middle of day. Had chick parm and veal parm entrees. Excellent flavor. Sauce was very tasty. Big portions. Rolls made in house. Service very nice. Good location. Only other Italian I go to is Mama Ricotta and that's a drive in traffic from Lake Wylie. This will be my new go to. Please keep up the service and food. Don't let it slide. Please. Can't wait to try pizza next. Read Nora Gs review. Sounds to me like it's a promo review for Sammy's.,positive
"I can't get over how nice the staff is. The food and atmosphere are great too! We have been here 4 times already and it's always consistent. I highly recommend this place! It's a welcomed, much needed addition to this area.",positive
"Been here 3 times and actually seems to gets better every visit we make . Great service, fresh food and good drinks can't ask for much more than that and their prices are very reasonable. Definitely in the top 5 best Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area.",positive
"Has potential but needs to step it up a bit. Great to have a sit down restaurant in the area. Inside was loud- could use something to soften the noise. Patio is a nice addition although the small lawn allowed patrons to let their kids run and shout- not conducive to a grown up quiet dinner. Server was friendly and attentive and knew the menu. Bread could have been served with a plate for dipping. Both olive oil and salad dressing were served in cheap plastic tubs- it would be classier and more environmentally friendly to use a nicer reusable bowl. Shrimp pasta special was amazing! Veal Saltimbocca was less so. Prosciutto was more like thick Canadian bacon, and the whole thing was covered in a huge gooey wad of bland mozzarella and spinach. Put on a large bed of spaghetti- the whole dish seemed thrown together, and like a tacky version of what could be a tasty Italian favorite. We will go back for sure, but might stick with local favorites like pizza and pasta. I don't think I would risk disappointment by trying the more traditional Italian trattoria fare. With some work this can be a real gem!",negative
"We went on a whim and were amazed! Spectacular service! We absolutely enjoyed everything about our dining experience including the Chianti recommended by the bartender, calamari, Pasta, balsamic dressing and hot bread! The portions were enough to share and the pricing was affordable- especially when you can share! Great family and or date night with indoor and outdoor seating. We will drive back from Belmont to enjoy this Italian delight!",positive
"so excited to have this place in the neighborhood. We ordered a margherita pie and some salads to go. The pizza is just as good, if not better than my favorite margherita pie from NJ and that's saying a LOT. I never thought I'd see the day where I'd love pizza in Charlotte- this beats all places by far. it's the real deal. They have pasta dishes, calzones, hot and cold sandwiches, etc. Can't wait to eat my way through the menu!",positive
"I can't comment on the service because we have only ever ordered to go (we live 2 mins down the road). However, I am so thankful to have a place close by that is actually worth the money. It's very hard for a lot of southern restaurants to impress me (I'm from NY and I came from a straight off the boat Italian family)- but Enricos really impressed me big time. The sauce is perfect! The bread is fresh and actually quite delicious.",positive
"We arrived about 5 pm Tuesday. Not crowded. We were greeted at the door and shown to a table by the window. Two waters, and bread were delivered fast. Our order of large Calzone and two salads was taken. The salads arrived in a few minutes and it was a plate full. All fresh. The Calzone arrived as big as a large pizza! 1/2 went home as lunch for tomorrow. The sauce and cheese had great flavor. I did not have room for desert. They have a bar and craft beers. So under 35$ and we got 4 meal. Great food and service.",positive
"We have been twice and really liked it... we just stopped for appetizers and a glass of wine both times, so we especially like it now that they have their ABC license and will be stocking a full bar. The first time we sat outside and the patio is very comfy and last night we sat at the bar with Chad and he took extra wonderful care of us. Maria, the manager, also checked on us throughout both meals to make sure we enjoyed everything. The pizza was pretty delicious, especially the cheese, and it was fun to watch the owner and the other chef making pizzas and other goodies. The marinara is yummy for the garlic knots and I realllllly loved the shrimp scampi. I really want that over some angel hair pasta next time! Or the chicken parm, which I was eyeing at the neighboring table and looked deeelish! We don't have kids, but it is family friendly for those who do.",positive
"I was a little hesitant trying this new restaurant in its first week of opening, but we had a very good experience. The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in, and sat us right down. Three different people asked if we needed anything while we waited for our dinner. The food was very tasty. We will definitely go back and try more of their menu",positive
"Came for dinner with my wife and 21 mo old sold, staff was great, food was fantastic, we all LOVED our pasta. Service was great and the food came very quickly. Prices are fantastic for great Italian food, will be coming back again as there where ALOT of other things in the menu that we wanted to try",positive
I am staying at the hotel across the street and didn't feel like driving. The service was fast. The food is really good too which surprised me given the negative reviews.,positive
"Why do I continue to punish my self MAN !!! I These guys stay in business because of dummies like me. I thought they might have changed. Ordered in drive through, I got a #9 and she rushed me saying "" Is that all "" I said no i Want a large Pina She then rushed me again and no I asked for 3 green salsa. Can you believe it she missed all that I had to explain a second time at the window . She gives me the food and shoozz me off. HELLLOOOO !!! I just told you I wanted a Pina !! She charges me for the drink the whole bill was $14 What did I order? I get down the road and booooom My ORDER IS FREAKIN WRONG AAAHHHH !!!! PLEASE BOYCOTT ALL FILBERTOS They are all the same.. What a shame What the Heck is up with the meat ? Is It boiled Disgusting",negative
"The service was rude and the food was poorly prepared, my tostadas literally had a spoonful of beans on the tostadas. The food was smashed together in in one container (4 tostadas per container).",negative
"The enchiladas were ok, portions were good, it looked good, but not much was there taste wise. Honesty my favorite thing about the place was the cute girl that worked in the front today.",negative
"I don't like beans and they put beans on my food when I had said no beans. Meat is low quality and served cold. The guy in the back has a bad temper, bad attitude and doesn't know how to treat customers.",negative
"This is the worst Filibertos Mexican Restaurant ever! Being a guy that just came out of work and was really hungry, i decided to eat here. While at the drive thru i ordered a steak and egg burritto with cheese. A meal that costs 7 dollars. The cashier ran my credit card and me without noticing it, he charged me $83. I was beyond furious about the situation. When i had contacted them if i could talk to a manager, an employee just kept on hanging up on me after saying ""filibertos how may i help you."" I actually had to go to the store and confront them about it and still they couldnt help me. The meals they serve is always cold and the wait time here is also ridiculous. Dont ever come to this restaurant. If i could give them a negative star, i would but one star is the lowest. Hell they dont even deserve a star. I just want my money back that they took!",negative
"Stupid lady at the drive thru... I told her 3 times at drive thru and at window, I wanted BEEF enchiladas number 5... She charged me for BEEF... Then I got my order, went to work... And at work, they were the crappy flat cheese enchiladas. Stupid idiot... Nothing but morons that work here",negative
Decided to give this place another chance and I was beyond disappointed I went through the drive thru. I order my food and I pay with my debit card. As I pay I ask the lady if I could have a horchata. As they where handing my food I ask aging if I could get an horchata and at this point it was a different lady handing me my food and said she needed to see my i.d. I ask her you need to see my i.d. for a horchata she said yes I need your i.d. at this point I was beyond irritated since no i.d. had been required to pay the meals I got with my debit card and it was not sign on the back and it was clear I was going to pay cash for the drink I had ask for. I told her to forget it and I left. Never aging going to this place. Sadly I can't rate them lower if I could I would. Wish I could of talk to a manager but aging I'm sure no one would of done nothing about it. Makes me feel worry now that no i.d. was ask for my card. I would have to keep and eye on my bank account now.,negative
Quality of food has continued to decline. The last item I ordered was chicken tacos (4 of them) and 2 were full of nothing but chicken skin and cheese. No real meat. The other 2 were a combination of meat and skin. Not what I had planned for dinner. Not to mention how rude the cashier was.,negative
"I arrived with my brother and friend, hungry, and ready to order. After waiting for half an hour, we decided to leave due to the fact that the two men working ignored the complete fuck out of us. We addressed them once for help, and realized they ignored us. Maybe at an attempt to avoid working. Nice job guys.",negative
"Fish tacos were actually pretty good. Filibertos is usually pretty below average, but this location seems to have some quality food.",positive
"Honestly, never heard of Filiberto's until I moved here to Phoenix. Filiberto's is a Mexican chain restaurant that serves from rice plates, burritos, quesadillas and the like. It's also open 24 hours. I took advantage of their drive through, since I had a hankering for Carne Asada fries and needed something quick. Carne Asada Fries & Horchata TBH, the Carne Asada fries is indeed large in portion and comes with fast food, thin cut fries. Topped with a large amount of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and a side of sauce (red or green). The fries were okay, the meat was a tad bit tough and you get enough meat to cover the entirety of the fries. The sour creme seems a bit diluted, doesn't have a tang just adds a creaminess to the dish. The red sauce was nothing memorable, just a plain red sauce. Typically, when I've had Carne Asada Fries they come with everything that usually comes in a burrito besides the tortilla. No signature kind of sauce? Guys, you're really making me miss La Victoria and Iguana's in San Jose, California. Horchata, tastes diluted as well, probably came from the fountain and not made fresh- though it was not expected. Slight cinnamon flavor. Tastes more watery than rice- like. Paid about $9 for Carne Asada Fries (that will probably last me as 4 meals) and a drink. Very bare bones kind of fast food Mexican, would only go here as a last resort or because of it's convenience. Other than that, wouldn't consciously choose Fili-B's for Mexican food- hankering and all.",negative
"Let me start by saying that we are regulars here. The girl that normally helps us out is always timely, and she is able to get my (rather complicated) order right. Tonight when we went, the drive thru was being ran by a manager, so I expected even better service than usual. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. I ordered my usual- carne asada fries. But I like them without cheese, and they gave them to me with cheese on them. So, I returned to have them fix my order, and it took about 15 minutes for them to remake the fries, and much to my dismay, the fries were disgustingly soggy, and way undercooked. It's unfortunate one of the young girls is better at running the restaurant than the manager. But, I'm still giving it three stars because even after the many mistakes, I am addicted to their carne asada fries and will probably be back tomorrow. Great food, not always great service.",negative
I love this place!! I come here for breakfast a couple times a week and always get their rolled tacos. The staff is friendly and always make the food pretty fast. One thing that I would probably recommend is that they get a new speaker for the drive thru but other than that everything is great.,positive
"There was a time I would have said that this was the best sports bar in the area, but that time is long gone. The bar started to deteriorate after they lost one of their great cooks and a couple of girls who were great servers (after they graduated and went on to better things) and have not ever gotten back to that previous great level. We use to go their at least one or two times a week but slowly lost interest in the place. Went back a week ago to see if it had improved and I think it's gotten worse. Food was close to bad, service was terrible. Find a better place to spend your money. Still remember the good old days so I'll probably try again in 6 months or so in hopes that the owners find that magic again. Hope they do.",negative
"PERMANENTLY CLOSED 12/2/13 at 12pm. Worst tasting vodka soda ever. And a SUPER light pour. Something is wrong w/their beverage gun. Not friendly bartender either. Also, they have HORRIFIC TVs. And few of them. Small tubes, old school rear projection screens and to make matters worse, some are on cable and some on satellite SO SOME TVs are ahead of others, meaning, half the bar cheers before the other half has seen the play!!! Only 2 small (24"") TVs at bar plus a literal 16"" tube TV. The carbonation in the draft beers is too low and the limes are the thinnest cut/smallest limes I've ever seen!",negative
"I love a good dive bar but this place is disgusting! I was with a group of 7 looking for a bite to eat on a Saturday evening before making the long drive to Glendale for a pre-season Cards game. We walked in and the place was dead...nobody was in the dining area and a few people were sitting around the bar drinking. Inside it was dark, dingy and felt dirty. While waiting for service, I noticed a small stage and a few games to play but nobody was even around this area. We waited a solid 10 minutes and were never greeted nor did anyone come to take our drink/food order. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to leave. One of the people in my party yelled as we were walking out ""You just lost about $300 in business by not even acknowledging us!"". True fact. I won't be back.",negative
"Yuck. Wife and I have been to this place a handful of times over the 19 years we lived nearby. We certainly know it is a dive bar and were in the mood for one drink.....at a dive bar. When we sat down, I said to the wife that it looks like they have not spent one dollar on upgrading or cleaning since we first came in 19 years later. So we ask the bartender lady about the happy hour (Sat night) specials and they are pretty reasonable. I get a a well vodka tonic and the wife a big draft. Drinks served. As soon as I took my first sip, I was hit with the grossest odor from my drink imaginable. The only way to describe it is if you have worked under your sink and removed the p-trap. That was the smell. I asked my wife to check it out and she almost threw up. Trust me, we are not wimps or over reaching yuppies. I called the bartender lady over and told her my drink smells really bad and will take a beer. I also asked her if she would at least smell it as well so she could maybe figure out which of the 3 ingredients might be causing the smell....ice, vodka or tonic water. She said, no I do not need to and dumped the drink out. WTF....you would think she may want to find out the source of the issue. I did not make a big deal of the situation when I spoke to her and kept it friendly but was surprised that she did not care at all. I feel sorry for the next person who ordered the same drink. Had the girl checked out the drink and cared at all as to what may be causing the odor, I would not have written this. Lastly, our seats at the bar had a great view of the sinks and equipment behind the counters and to be quite frank, I cannot believe this place can pass a food inspection. Word to the owner(s)...read these reviews and use it as a lesson on success going forward. It is for your own good.",negative
"Best wings I've had in a LONG time. The hot is more like medium, so order accordingly. Most important - order yours finished on the BBQ. They're really good and crispy, not gooey and drowning in sauce (although you can order them tossed again in sauce after they're grilled). Great wine burgers too. Good casual neighborhood bar atmosphere, friendly wait staff. Recently added pool tables, TVs in booths, and live music.",positive
I went Friday night. It was packed. I'm not sure what the attraction is except you want to be in a crowd? Nothing special but the excellent onion rings.,negative
"Since my last review, I have been to FRD about 20 times (awkwardly became a regular Trivia player) and they 'revamped' their menu. I can't write a more honest review at this point. Out of all the things I have learned (and will highlight soon), the saddest one is that I don't think management ever hears our comments, the server's comments or even our Yelp reviews. I mean, come on- Not a single 4-5 star review on Yelp? Staff, I hope you're listening, cause i'm talking. FRD Menu 'upgrades': - They took out the Grande Burger (double patty), which we ordered. They now have an ""ultimate burger"" which is the EXACT same as the regular cheeseburger, but you pay $1 for an extra slice of a difference cheese (""of your choice!""). - They took out the veggie platter out of their appetizers, so now the only way to get veggies is to order them tempura battered and deep fried. Yuk - They took out the soup/salad combo for $5.43 (tax inc) but the side salad has the same price so now if you want the combo, you have to pay $3 more. Side note: they have never served me hot soup (I ask them to reheat every single time, even with the soggy tortillas in them). They charge you 25c for extra dressing. - They added chicken sliders. The chicken is the same from the chicken fingers (which is 60% breading, 40% ""chicken""). The bread in the sliders has sometimes been tasty and other times stale. All in all, everything in their menu is overpriced by approximately $2. Their HOT DOG, at $8.50 is overpriced by ~$6 as, lets face it people, its a hot dog (its not even $8 at a freaking stadium). On the only positives I can think of are their balsamic salad dressing (claimed house made) and their sweet potato fries (but they need a tasty dipping sauce other than Ranch). I really really hope they realize that the only reason why they have customers is because of Trivia Night. Trust me FRD, we're not there for your food.",negative
"This place had promise but then you enter and you wished you'd have stayed away. You walk in and it's empty. You go to the bar to get a drink and the girl was a bit rude with plenty of attitude to back it up. I peeked at their menu and it was not anything special. As for the drinks, they are pretty cheap. But I am being completely serious when I tell you that the only reason we had a good time was because my boyfriend and I entertained ourselves with the bar game video console. We got so into the games that my boyfriend knocked over the chair he was sitting on! Then the guy across the bar said ""I think that's the first time a sober person knocked over their bar stool!"" LOL I was laughing about that for at least 10 minutes.",negative
"The first round that we ordered was Kilt Lifter. You could tell the moment she set down the beers they weren't carbonated. Few sips later that was confirmed. Although the waitress claimed she wouldn't know because she didn't drink draft beer she didn't charge us for the round and brought the next round: Fat Tire. No carbonation again, and had a faint but distinct soapy aftertaste. For some reason she thought I was weird for not drinking that. Well onto the non draft beers next! The Corona was bubbly and the lime was covered in bubbly goodness! This was fantastic. I had 3. My friend went through 3 non draft beers and ended with a Pabst Blue Ribbon. After noticing the date on the bottom of the can we took to our smart phones like the pro bar detectives we are! If our initial research is correct and the date on the bottom of the can is not a ""Born On"" date they just served a beer that was 2 months past expiration. We also ordered meals. These were good for bar food! The chicken strips with buffalo sauce were hot, yummy, and crisp. My friends quesadilla looked good and he didn't complain. It would have been nice if she would have gotten our food order in while it was still happy hour. A lot of waitresses will let you know and try to do that for you. 2/10 would not drink. I don't understand how a place Famous Sams on Lindsey and Baseline, great food, great location, and great bartenders shuts down and this place could still be in business.",negative
"Wasted 20 minutes of my life in this dive waiting for a waitress to finally stop by and take my order. It wasn't busy, but apparently it takes a while to get the bubble gum off your finger after standing around twirling it behind the bar. I walked out.",negative
"This is a pretty typical bar that offers the standard happy hour specials as well as mediocre bar food. I usually play pool every time I visit if the tables aren't jammed packed. It seems like every time I'm there its a karaoke night (go figure) although on some occasions its poker night. The one incredible deal that this bar offers is 10 cent beers all day long on your birthday. I've had the opportunity to use this amazing deal just once, but I'm seriously considering doing it again. Lets just say it was an amazing birthday experience and I spent more on tips than beer that night. Lol.",negative
"HORRIBLE!!!! Went there to watch the Rose Bowl. Walking into this place I did not have high expectations at first glance. Seemed like a typical hole in the wall cheap sports bar. They have a lot of TVs ... if you dont mind poor quality. They have a relatively big menu for a sports bar ... again, if you don't mind poor quality. The food was very bland and boring, even for a sports bar. And the clientele ... I couldnt watch the fourth quarter of the game because a couple of regulars got into a fist fight, flipped a couple tables, injured a waitress, and ended my visit with the police and paramedics showing up. I do not recommend this bar and will definitely not be going back myself.",negative
"FRD is pretty much an average bar without much to distunguish it aside from being stumbling distance from home. They have poker a couple times a week as well as karaoke along with a band evey once in a while. They've an ok to fair selection of beer (no Guinness shockingly enough) and liquor. The food is tolerable for bar food, but I have had much better at other bars. Service happens to depend who's on duty. Some of their bartenders have been awesome while others...well, not so much. Overall, if you're looking for a place to toss back a few, play some poker or sing some karaoke in an okay but not necessarily stunning place and you're close by, check it out. Not a place I'd suggest if you've got to cross town for or want a higher end / glitzy establishment though.",negative
"Went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed (and disgusted?) in the place. I literally STUCK to the floor. It was gross. Their carpet is nasty. The bathroom wasn't much better. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't expect a lot from a sports bars, but I also don't expect to stick to the floor! The waitress I had was great, and the drinks were cheap and strong - but not enough so to bring me back in the future. 2 thumbs down.",negative
"Pretty much the most average bar you've ever been to in Gilbert. Service is as expected, and the karaoke activities appeared to be non-stop. Nothing in particular is bad, it's just a typical sports bar. Would be great if they had more variety beyond the scope of karaoke. Prices are somewhat expensive considering the size of the establishment, but you won't be broke afterward. But I imagine it's not the fault of the owners that their lease is pricey (they are after all, in Gilbert). Take a friend or few, because there isn't too many people to converse with. Some patrons are obviously regulars, but others are not.",negative
"The best thing this bar has going for it is that it's stumbling distance from my house. I've never seen it packed, and it's usually a somewhat depressing, lackluster ""regular"" crowd. Nothing sets it out from any of the other bars, to the positive or the negative. It could be any lame bar in any lame city. The time I was there for karaoke, I do have to say the karaoke host was quite good natured, as my 2 incredibly drunk friends and I quickly learned, no, we in fact do NOT know all the words to ""Gold Digger"". He was quite encouraging, as we more or less mumbled incoherently through the song, flung the mics at him, and ran back to hide our shame in our beers. (Hmmm, Chris T, were you there that night?) I actually keep forgetting it's there, it's sort of hidden in the parking lot of a non-exciting shopping center. However, if you do go in, give Jamie, the bartender props - she's fun, and probably part of the reason that regulars keep going back. Overall, I'll probably go again in the future, but I would love to see them do something to liven the place up.",negative
"The First Round Draft in Gilbert is AWFUL!!!! I ordered a Ruben..easy right?? NOPE, I asked for the bread slightly toasted and it came looking like someone put it through a shredder (I was told that is how it looks if you order it like that). It had a golf ball-sized amount of meat on it. The waitress never came to see how things were and I finally had to take it to the bar where I was an inconvenience to the bartender. It still took a few minutes for someone to come over and by that time I was finished. So the waitress sad ""OK"" and turned around and walked away. The rest of the staff thought it was amusing. In these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way. There are MANY other places to go. DO NOT EAT HERE. When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad. Terrible service and worse food! The place was empty, I wonder why...",negative
"First Round Draft is of the type of bars i like to go to. Not too flashy or trendy. Just a simple sports bar with lots of regulars and horrible karaoke participants. The food served here is decent. if you want the best on the menu, I would have to recommend the sliders (remember... it's bar food). Overall, the service is good (polite waitresses and bartenders). I believe they even serve breakfast there now! I would love to read a review on their breakfast. 3 stars because it is REALLY nothing special, but its fun and close to my house.",negative
"11h15 : la porte est débarré donc je rentre. La fille me dit que c'est fermé jusqu'à 11h30 en marchant vers moi. Très désagréablement, elle me pousse dehors et sans blague, du fait même me ferme la porte dessus. Pourquoi encourager un commerce qui engage des gens sans savoir-vivre ?",negative
"The short - pretentious, grossly over-priced and disgusting burgers with seriously rude staff to boot. Came here with my family, easily the most disgusting food we've had in Montreal. Ordered a ""Texan"" and a tiny, half-burnt patty arrived soaked in what I can only describe as runny, sweet ketchup. Absolutely inedible and an insult to Texas. The ""sauce"" was pouring out of from between a small, rock-solid bun. Even trying to pick it up, the whole thing was a soggy mess. We told our server and she took it away. They spent the next 5 minutes laughing in the kitchen. When the bill came, they insisted on charging me for it. The server came to explain she couldn't remove it without calling her boss. In the end, after a phone call, they insist on charging for the burger I had one bite of, one bite that required 5 napkins to clean up the mess. The kitchen ""cook"" emerged only to berate me and snicker. Appalling customer service and outrageously rude and arrogant kitchen staff. They would sooner laugh and dismiss what was a helpful critique of their precious haute burgers. Other items on the menu are equally repugnant, unless your idea of a burger includes slices of apple, honey or some deliberately obscure variety of lettuce. The fries were cold and soggy, and really skimpy on servings. For the prices this place charges, you would expect a honkin' good feed. Frite Alors thinks adding an olive on your plate justifies the ludicrously stupid prices. Anyone who's ever seen Ramsay's visit to Amy's Baking Company might enjoy the experience. She serves up ""delicious"" food and anyone that disagrees is a ""hater"" and gets ripped off and yelled at. The one star is for actually getting away with charging that much for this garbage. Never, ever EVER again.",negative
Their poutine and salad were really good! The customer service was amazing as the hostess was very nice and welcoming to us tourists. I would definitely recommend heading here to those interested in eating true Montreal cuisine. I am for sure coming back the next time I visit.,positive
"C'est un très petit frite alors, mais il est cool. Des fois c'est super busy et d'autre c'est super calme. La bouffe est similaire (et même mieux) que d'autre resto similaire. J'adore leur sauce! Moi je viens surtout dire allô à mon ami qui travail. Mais c'est tellement le fun manger. Miam. J'aime Ben le comptoir pour manger et jaser avec le staff (serveur, serveuse, cuisinier et cuisinière) pis boire de la bière. C'est comme chiller dans un pub. Ils font pour emporter aussi. Et ils sont à côté de chez moi. Point bonus!",positive
"Vraiment excellent, à la hauteur de la réputation de Frite Alors. Laitue-Tomates ultra fraîches. Petit pain carré et boulette de buf pur font de leur hamburger classique un délice. Les frites sont excellentes également, les meilleures qu'on trouve à Montreal probablement.",positive
"C'est toujours agréable d'aller commander chez Frites Alors : dans n'importe quel restaurant de la chaîne, les produits sont de qualité, les saveurs sont toujours correctes et le service est excellent. Le Frite Alors dans le quartier Villeray ne déroge pas à la règle. L'équipe est vraiment sympa et vous fait même des suggestions. Pour ma part, je viens principalement pour commander une poutine ou bien le burger Savoyard (un délice, je vous le conseille). Mais il y a quand même quelques inconvénients à relever, comme le temps de préparation assez long (une fois, j'ai dû attendre 10 minutes) ou encore l'endroit assez petit : lorsqu'il y a du monde, il est assez difficile de se frayer un chemin ! Un Frites Alors bien utile et toujours idéal dans un quartier tel que Villeray.",positive
"Leurs frites sont toujours excellentes! J'aime moins la sauce à poutine (trop salée à mon goût) mais si vous prenez la tacos ou celle au porc effiloché vous serez enchantés! Le service est souvent plutôt lent, il faut pas être pressé!",positive
"My experience is limited to a binge order of poutine my friend and I stopped by to eat on the way home. Firstly, parking is easy at least... at the time of the evening I came in. The location is tiny with a dozen seats or more. It looked somewhat of a dive in the garage of someone's home. Sadly, as it is winter, even with the front door drapes for when it opens and closes doesn't do a whole lot of its clientele and I was pretty cold in my seat furthest to the door. Needless to state, I ate with my jacket on. We ordered small poutine called ""L'Eau a la Bouche"" and the ""Cochonne"". The main reason is that we thought the poutine price was a bit exaggerated. Once we received our portions we truly realized that our small poutine, is pretty small. Considering it's close to $10, we didn't think we got a great deal. How did it taste? It was pretty decent but nowhere near the quality you'd get at really popular locations. It wasn't McDonald's quality poutine but it wasn't anywhere close to what you'd get at Poutineville and with that location allowing you to order what you want and their ""small"" being twice as big as what I was served here (and the price tag being somewhat similar), let's just say, I won't be back. Service was decent and amiable.",negative
"It was the final hours of our trip to Montreal, and if we hadn't found poutine before departing, I'm pretty sure I would have had divorce papers waiting at home. Enter Frite Alors, which saved the day! We got off to a bit of a rocky start when we sat, chatted with the friendly waitress, admired the mod interior, perused the graphicutesy menus and then had to leave because we weren't carrying cash. (WE NEVER CARRY CASH. Neither do most savvy travelers. Get with the times, people!) However, once we'd found an ATM, we circled back, because not only does Frite Alors have poutine: in fact, it boasts an entire menu of poutines. Diners choose from close to a dozen variations that include sausage, bacon and / or grilled vegetables in addition to the golden standard of gravy and fresh cheese. I was craving classic French food and swooned over the Croque Monsieur: ham, cheese, and mustard on toasted bread, though this one also came with fresh lettuce and tomato (they were added after the toasting, so it was a nice crispy-melty contrast. But what really tugged at my heartstrings was the option to substitute a small salad for half the fries that came with the sandwich. I'll repeat that in case any American restaurant happens to be listening: Instead of a GIANT PILE of fries, they allow the option of a reasonable number of fries and a small salad -- full of fresh, crunchy vegetables and drizzled with a creamy vinaigrette. I had been dreaming of that perfect healthy-junky equilibrium for years! I was really craving a Belgian beer, but thanks to our shortage of cash (we were trying to use it all up before recrossing the border) it remained a dream. That silly, needless inconvenience is the only reason I can't give five stars for such a fantastic experience!",positive
"I know this is a chain. But it's a very very good chain. They have great burgers (on delicious bread). Great beer. Great service. And AMAZING exotic poutine (not just your regular - although they have that too). The gravy might not be the best of all the plain poutine options in Montreal, but the special ones are truly special. Try the Frite Alors! Poutine (they're own special one) - you will not regret it. This particular restaurant in the chain seems small compared to others.. just, fyi if you need a lot of space. I thought it was intimate and nice, though.",positive
This is probably the best pizza place in town they have amazing pizza for an affordable price!! They had a slip up and forgot to add pepperoni to my slice of pizza and I went back in and they gave me a whole pepperoni pizza for free to make up for it! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat.,positive
"Pizza is not all that, slices are anything but giant and not worth the money. Postmates ordering options are terrible. Did not get the pizza I was expecting. Big bubbles all over the pizza and zio pizza and wings in Mesa on University is so much better. Will not order from this place again.",negative
"I have lived in the area for a while and had been wanting to checkout this place. Good pizza, you get what you pay for. They gave me accurate delivery times and were very pleasant to deal with. I'll be back:)",positive
Ok pizza. We preordered and it didn't seem fresh because it was dry. Not enough sauce and the dough was like cardboard. The wings were good. The garden salad was plain and the lettuce was not cut. Kind of disappointed because the pics looked great. Maybe its better if you eat it there.,negative
The pizza is great but the cheesesteaks are so amazing!!! My son constantly asks to eat at Genos because he loves the cheesesteak! The staff is friendly every time we order.,positive
"We just moved to the area and decided to give Genos a try. Service was quick and the driver was very friendly. The food was amazing.! We ordered an Italian sandwich and a pizza. It was fresh, tasted great, and made the way we ordered it. I wholeheartedly recommend Genos Giant Slice to anyone that wants great food!",positive
"Okay so last night my husband ordered a 24 inch pizza. He asked for half the pizza to have extra cheese and the other half regular. When he got it home, yes one half was extra cheese the other half wad just bread, no sauce no cheese! When my husband called back he was told by the manager well thats what u ordered! No it was not. Mine you we order from Geno a lot and never has the service or this young man's attitude real bad but i do understand how he could honestly think someone would order a pizza that was half bread and i mean bread only! My husband went back today to talk with a manager but of course there wasnt one but in comes the same man from last night that not only was rude as the night before but actually had the nerve to threaten my husband. To think that someone could be that rude and dispectable to a customer and by the way a veteran, i dont think i will be giving my business here again!",negative
"Out of mozzarella sticks? Don't be surprised if you get told the giant slice can't be ordered: its a lunch only item... ""says at the top of the menu"" Um, top of the lunch menu sure. But the main menu is a different board, without that info. #fail",negative
"My second dad works here and i absolutely love it. The food is great, it's big enough to fit an entire birthday party, and the whole staff is extremely kind. Would most definitely recommend this genos location to anyone who loves pizza and awesome service.",positive
"Went in again. Had wings honey hot well done. Ian the manager made sure they were bomb for me. Then had a 18"" philly pizza the best ever. You gotta skip over the 14"" and try the 18"" or 24"". Thats were the quality is. Wings and philly pie hit the spot. Love this place",positive
"Went here today for the first time. I got the spicy steak and cheese. OMG! Delicious. So good. My daughter got the chicken, bacon, ranch sandwich. She loved it. I don't know what cheese they use but it was nails for spring. Shout out to this gem of a restaurant.",positive
This my second time I have came to this establishment and this is worst experience I have dealt with. I came in and the young gentleman took my order and I asked him to not put certain toppings on my steak n cheese and when I got home those same toppings were on there. I asked for a giant slice with my order then the young gentleman told me they don't sell it after 4pm. When there is no advertisements saying so. It got so bad that they was bringing my food out and I had to ask for a bag and when I did they didn't even bag my food for me they gave me the bag and I had to bag it myself. What type of shit is that? What type of customer service is that. Idk if I was a trick customer but I won't come back here or any other one if the service continues to be like this. Save ur money make ur own.,negative
"Pizza was fast and delicious! Their Philly Cheese steaks are a bit on the pricey side, but it's delicious. The pizza crust was a bit thinner than expected, but it was still decent",positive
"Ordered a pizza for take out. The gentleman said it would be out in 10 minutes, and got the pizza in 10 minutes. It was very good and at an excellent price. Very happy and will go there again.",positive
Went to Genos for my lunch and they got me my pizza in about ten minutes. I ordered the buffalo chicken and my boyfriend was skeptical at first but it was fantastic. The crust is my preferred thinness and the pizza itself was like a morph between hot wings and pizza. Definitely going to be my new go to pizza!,positive
Have usually had great experiences with the pizza at this location their $5 Pizza is amazing! I ordered 2 large 24inch New York style pizzas for a birthday party and let me tell you the quality is just not the same. there was barely any cheese on the pizza and they put the same amount of toppings as you would for a regular 14 inch pizza. The value is just not there and especially since I was ordering their premium Pizza Pizza I was expecting a more premium experience and taste as well. I would buy their $5 pizza again but never again will I by there New York style pizza. Customer service at this location is Amazing by the way the staff is always kind and ready to help. So I give this place an average rating based on my overall experience.,negative
"GrubHub completely screwed this up, but Ian made it right when we went there. Ian is a good manager and made a 2 star situation into a 5 star. They paid us back the delivery charge, the tip and gave us free drinks with our meal since GrubHub didn't even give them the order. Thank you for a fantastic meal",positive
"Order was taken quickly and staff was very nice. Order came out in a timly fashion Had the veggy pizza, it was very tasty :) would buy again.",positive
This place has very good pizza the best ive had in a long time and and there wings are good and there cheese steak fries are the bomb and everything is reasonably priced,positive
"Great pizza and friendly service. Family owned small business. They have sandwiches, wings and salads too...great place!",positive
"The food was delicious. Great pizza and sandwiches with a very pleasant staff. Great price also. Overall, nothing negative to say about it. I would recommend to all friends and family.",positive
"Wife and me have been coming here since they open up this new location, and hands down its the best New York style pizza. Either if you order the 18 or 24 inch you can't go wrong! I recommend this pizza to everybody who wants a giant slice of perfection!",positive
"The place looks very run down. In fact I would have never come in if it wasn't for the fact someone else brought me. As a matter of fact I have been by this place 100's of time and never looked twice. Speaking of I bet they loose a lot of business from folks like me who pass by and don't look twice. Once you are in the inside looks just as bad as outside. However, prices are reasonable, service is always friendly and food is fresh. I have been back several times since my first time and I am sure I will be back some more in the future. You might want to check your glass though as mines had lipstick on it once! Ewwww",negative
"Today was my first visit to Gus' SIR Beef. I've always driven by and noticed the awesome smells coming from there but never got the opportunity to drop in. I'm going to start by saying that yes... yes the decor could use a little updating. Ok now that this is out of the way, let me get to the food. Oh man... I had the shrimp, collards, and potato wedges, the shrimp were cooked to perfection, the collards tasted like they were cooked by my mother, and the potato wedges were crispy like i like them. Oh and I loved the biscuits, too. Needless, to say, it was top notch. My waitress was sweet and very helpful. She made sure that our visit was positive. The only reason I am giving a 4 rather than a 5 is the decor. If you can look past this, you're in for a great meal.",positive
"Walked in and did not stay. Very marginal sanitation score and every seat had torn leather. I kept looking for a booth that had seats that were decent and not torn. There were NONE. This place was just too gross to stay. The exterior is run down. The interior is worse. Could have had good food, but based on the appearances of everything else, I was not about to take a chance. This is all too bad because I know this restaurant has been a Charlotte staple for a lot of decades. The simple reality is that if the owners want to keep it open, they need to invest some money in some updates. And they need to get their sanitation score better. Two thumbs DOWN. Yuck.",negative
"It's a dump, no getting around that but I keep coming back because of food and service. Fried chicken is to die for and can't forget squash and banana pudding. Jess is the best and will always take care of you with the most awesome smile. I would give 5 stars if building was fixed up.",positive
Don't let the building fool you. The best fried squash in Charlotte. The fried chicken is made to order and is well worth the wait. The kitchen is as clean or cleaner than most fancy places. I've been going there for over 30 years.,positive
"I'm from Charlotte and know the reason it has been in Charlotte for about 30 years - it's damn good comfort food at very good prices. I enjoyed Gus's! Fantastic meatloaf with Great mac 'n cheese, GB's. My son loved the chicken steak with gravy. Service was good for the single waitress available. She was nice, and the owner was friendly as well. This is going to be my weekly go-to!",positive
Great home cooking. Prices are very reasonable. The interior could use some love but who cares when the food is so great!? Their fried squash is the best ever. The chicken and dumplings on Wednesdays are amazing. Service is friendly and efficient. Love this place!,positive
"A cab driver recommended this place for burgers, I was surprised to see pizza on the menu, but unfortunately they recently discontinued making them. The burger was very homemade, and they cook to temp. It was very good quality, but not enough fat, or char on the outside to make it a favorite. Still it's a great local spot with fast and friendly service.",negative
This place has great food. I love the chicken & dumplings. I get white rice & northern beans with onions. Too bad you can only get this only on Wednesdays.,positive
"I'm a little biased on this one being raised in a southern family who cooks food like this routinely. However, the food was good. I had beef tips which are served with peppers, onions, and rice. Lots of flavor. I got mac and cheese as my side and it was mediocre, typical southern baked mac and cheese. The cornbread was a little dry but the flavor was good. Apparently this place is owned by local farmers and most of the food served here is their produce. I will continue to eat here to support their cause and perhaps increase their number of stars depending on how my next meal goes there.",negative
"Good southern home style cooking with an ""at home"" feel. The service is excellent and this place has been around for a very long time. My favorite is the vegetable plate with a side of corn bread it's very filling and priced very reasonable! The fried squash is an absolute must to try. This place isn't super fancy but worth a lunch visit!!",positive
had the misfortune to eat there last saturday.the restaurant was very dirty.we had to wipe off our own table.there was trash and food all over the floor.the menus were crusted with old food. there were two servers on duty but service was very slow.the servers spent most of their time complaining about the lack of work from other employees.will NOT waste my time going back.,negative
"I'm really surprised at the poor reviews for this place. A few of them are so far off base it makes me question the reviewers motivations. I work in Charlotte and when I'm in the area I always try to grab lunch here. If you like country cooking you'll love this place and the food is consistently good. When I commented to my waitress about the consistency she informed me then owner is the cook. That explains it. I've never been impressed with beef tips and thus rarely order them. With the overall quality of their food being so good I ventured out and tried the tips, the house special. Now it's my favorite! Not sure where reviewer karby is coming from but her cherished ""13, 6 and 11"" is not only on par with but exceeds any other restaurant I've ever eaten at, specifically the tips and the fried squash. Their portions are large and the staff has always been friendly and efficient. On the lighter side the chef salad was very good and almost more than I could finish. Keep in mind I'm a big guy with an equally big appetite. As another reviewer mentioned, the owner comes out of the kitchen and talks to his patrons. I like that he puts forth the effort and found him an interesting and intelligent fellow. This review may sound too good to be legitimate but it is. I rarely review any establishment. My experience has to be extreme, good or bad, for me to put forth the effort. Judging from the number of regulars that frequent this place I know my experience is not the exception but rather the norm.",positive
"Started going here about two months ago and absolutely loved it! Its been good quality southern food, staff is very friendly. The owner even comes out of the kitchen to chat with yah. I hope everyone that left unhappy tries it again.",positive
"I love going here as I know each and every time what it is I like and want. They do not use pork in there vegetables nor lard in the making of the cornbread so that is a big plus for us. We usually get the ground sirloin steak with the pinto beans and collard greens. The steak comes smothered in mushroom gravy and I usually get diced onions in the pintos. They also offer dinner roll's but we always say ""nothing but cornbread"" as we love to crumble the hot fresh cornbread up in our pintos as well as the collard greens. We also like the idea that they have soft butter on the tables so it spreads easily and melts quickly in the cornbread which is also a great treat. The collard greens are fresh and cooked to perfection. I like mine with a little vinegar as well. Hope others will go and try this as well as other items. We like their fish, fried chicken and their Greek stuffed chicken is also a winner.",positive
"I can remember being in Gus's when I was too young to go to the restroom by myself. It was a regular in my life as we lived on Commonwealth, so we'd eat at Gus's all the time and I'd get 13, 6 and 11 as those numbers meant beef tips, mashed potatoes and AMAZING fried squash. I'm now 38 and still live very close by, but Gus's is SO not the same place that it once was. The building is filthy, outside and inside. The servers are sub-par and the food simply isn't worth eating... I ride by twice a day and miss my beloved 13, 6 & 11. HEY! - OWNER OF GUS'S!!! PLEASE CALL GORDON RAMSEY TO COME GET GUS'S BACK ON IT'S FEET!!! even if you don't give a damn about it anymore- we local's out here do still care and want to give you our money! Please ask for the help you so clearly need.",negative
"I personally know the owner's of Gus'... I recently visited after hearing good thing about it. What I realized was that once Gus passed away and stopped growing and serving all of his own vegetables including the famous fried squash, it probably hasn't been the same. VERY SWEET people, genuine, and there is a desire to keep the family thing going. But in all reality the food was just not what it probably once was. If this was a local place in my city I would only go because I know and love the owners. Not for the food. I could see this place being a local legend while Gus was running the show. But for those looking for that legend, they will be pretty disappointed after visiting. Love the people, not so much the food.",negative
"Gus...oh, Gus. I've driven by you for years and always wondered...""what-if""? What-if I had extra time for lunch; what-if I drove by and it was actually open? Well, all these ""ifs"" were answered in a recent visit. Some places, the outside can be deceiving. Hmm...not this place, the outside matches the inside unfortunately. Sticky menu's, dirty tables, salty blah food, EEK! The waitress was REALLY NICE though and looked like a veteran of the place. The food (beef & rice w/potato side) was not worth finishing, and the initial order almost didn't occur.",negative
"at roughly 2:00 feb 9 2018 I called this healthy planet to ask about a product a nutritionist named ""kayla"" -If that was her real name; hung up the phone on me in the middle of me asking about the price of a product. So i called back and she kept hanging up on me. So i kept calling determined to speak with a manager after that rude encounter. when the employee finally picked up she was rude so i asked to speak to a manager. After going back and forth with this rude nutritionist kayla; She finally handed the phone off to a male who i thought was the manager and he proceeded to blame me for them hanging up the phone; That i should be understanding when i asked for the employee's name he refused. I asked him several times for his name but he refused and was very rude about it. Considering i just spent over 100$ at this store. I felt really disrespected. I was going to be a loyal customer but after this i will never go back to a healthy planet again. with the attitude these employees have i hope the owner knows it wont be much longer before they lose all there loyal customers.",negative
"Nice location. Warden is still my favourite but I love that this one is conveniently located on the Danforth right outside of Chester Stn. I didn't buy anything, I just went inside to check it out as I've never seen this location before. It's really close to where I live so I'll be back!",positive
"I actually like this place. Its close to the subway and carries almost all the natural products that I want - organic coconut oil, aloe vera gel. The store helpers are also moderately helpful in helping you make smart shopping decisions. And the service has always been friendly - no complaints!",positive
"I agree with other reviewers that customer service at this store leaves a lot to be desired. They rarely answer the phone, most of the staff are just shelf stockers who look unhappy to be there. You would think if working stock is their primary function the shelves would be well-stocked, but no, more than half the time what I want is not on the shelf. Is it just this location or are they all like this?",negative
"I'm rating this a one for a few reasons, but mostly due to the lack of care in customer service. I have shopped here for a year, and have had too many bad experiences, in person and over the phone, and no longer shop here. The staff are unprofessional and disrespectful, and have zero skills in customer care or professional manner. Their food shelves are often poorly stocked, week after week, untidy, and the aisles are strewn with un-opened boxes on the floor. The cash desk is usually a complete disaster with flyers, supplement bottles, bags and boxes cluttering the small check-out area. On numerous occasions they have over-charged me on discounted items, and rarely is there more than one person on check-out to handle such problems. They don't spend a moment caring about their customer, their stock, or the way the store looks, and I won't spend another penny in this store.",negative
"I don't enjoy shopping at this Healthy Planet because I rarely feel welcome in the store. For me, it's a very transactional, no-frills experience. I walk in, grab my items, and go. With the exception of one woman who usually asks if I need help looking for a product, I find the employees at this store to be apathetic and almost unfriendly as they do not make eye contact or make an effort to greet you. My biggest annoyance about this store, however, is that I always have to check the receipt to see if they've bumbled the price. In the past year of shopping, I have probably had it happen about 3 or4 times. Since there is usually only one cashier present, it means I have to line up all over again to have their mistake corrected. It's usually a small difference, but since it happens at such a usual rate, it all adds up. Everything is on a digital POS, so why is it so hard to get the price right? It's just sketchy when a store advertises one price and doesn't comply with it. Besides their competitive pricing relative to the Big Carrot (my preferred grocery!), their only other saving grace is that they have a loyalty program which allows you to redeem money back on your purchase.",negative
"I'm a regular shopper here. I would say their prices are definitely better than the Big Carrot and Ottway (which used to have the best prices). But I definitely agree that Healthy Planet has trouble keeping things in stock. And when they run out, it seems to take forever to get it back in again. This also seems to be an issue at the Eglinton Town Centre location. I don't think bricks and mortar retailers can complain about people resorting to online shopping if they can't keep things in stock.",positive
"Poor business practices. They do not accept store gift cards after one year, even though they don't have an expiry date. Overpriced. The exact same healthy products or organic product can be found cheaper at other grocery stores.",negative
"Probably the worst store on the Danforth for health products. I live across the street and was thrilled when they opened. I could seriously walk to Carrot Common and back, faster then waiting in their lines. Today was ridiculous, I had a question and checked the aisles for help, nobody. Going to the front cash, seeing 1 employee, on a Saturday afternoon! Terrible, he had a good 10 people deep on his line, turned and left, only to see a help wanted cashier sign, been there for months. Riverdale won't stand for horrible customer service, get it together or you wont survive. Customer service doesn't cost a penny, you need actual employees first. Seriously",negative
"They don't walk their talk, plain and simple. So much potential and so little substance. Better than Ottway but that's no prize. I was excited when I first discovered this place a year ago. No more, this store has proven to be a continuous disappointment. The policies of this store is exactly why I prefer to buy my organic products at a regular super market. Nothing more frustrating than to try a new product, like it, buy it numerous times and then it is always out of stock because they are trying to reduce inventory on a similar product and they want you to buy that instead. This store is continuously out of stock of items I would consider main stay items for this reason. I don't think I am alone when I say people that shop in these types of stores are fussy (that's why we come here) so to continuously let them down will only drive them away. I find regular super markets are becoming more reliable. The customer service people can be frustrating too. You make it clear what you don't want and that's what they will try to sell you. Just because something says organic doesn't meant it is not processed. I expect more from a shop like this otherwise I may as well buy at loblaws, in time they will expand selection with support. I was able to find Allimax Garlic Caps here at an amazing price.",negative
"Standard Healthy Planet store. This location has produce, though it's usually not very good. Most of the grocery stores (incl fruit&veggie stores) on the Danforth have huge selections of organic foods. Also, just go to any of the nearby farmers markets during the summer. This location has the same overpriced products as any other. Healthy Planet is the only place that sells PUR gum, that I know of, and so that's why I've been in there. Unfortunately, Bulk Barn stopped selling it due to low sales. I don't recommend shopping at Healthy Planet unless they stock something you can't find elsewhere. Their business practices are shitty. They call themselves ""Healthy Planet"" yet their cash registers print out ridiculously long receipts on thick paper. A single 89c purchase gets you a foot long receipt. It doesn't really matter if the paper is recycled or not, it's still a huge waste of paper. They often have people in their stores promoting and selling people products that aren't healthy. I'm pretty sure they had people promoting some shitty fad diet. They've had people inside of their stores doing ""tests"" for ""imbalances."" The products they sell are often not healthy and not healthy for the planet. Huge sections of their stores are dedicated to unhealthy items such as granola bars. As any other grocery store, they tend to have a variety of any one type of product--the problem is that they sell products containing ingredients that are bad for the environment (usually due to how they are harvested), or just bad for consumption. They could easily not stock those items while still having products from other brands available. The point is that there is no quality control in what they sell, nor in what they promote. The name of their chain is opposite of what they are pushing. Their practices are generally unhealthy to the planet.",negative
"This place offers bad service, standard products, and normal prices. I find the attitude of the salespeople puzzling to frustrating. One time, I was recommended a product that was specifically what I had asked to avoid. The staff generally act as if they're doing me a favor by helping out. The store layout changes frequently, and most of the merchandise is available elsewhere in the neighbourhood. Why shop here?",negative
"I used to be a very loyal customer to the Big Carrot, just a couple of blocks away from The Healthy Planet. The other day, I went to The Healthy Planet to buy protein powder, and happened to browse the beauty aisle. I was stunned to see the hair colour that I usually buy at the Big Carrot for $5.00 cheaper here. I also noticed a couple of other items a couple of dollars cheaper than that of the Big Carrot. It's nice to see there is an alternative to the Big Carrot, and I will consider the Healthy Planet as my ""go to"" place now, instead. The beauty aisle is not as big the the Big Carrot, but as the another poster said, if you are not picky about the brand, this is a great place to shop. I hope they keep their prices competitive like this, it makes a big difference in this economy and will definitely keep me (and I'm sure many others) a consistent shopper. It's clean, spacious, I have always encountered kind staff. Overall, I highly recommend this place.",positive
"Rotten customer service and increasingly overpriced products! I was a fan of this place right up until my last experience. One of their employees tried to insult my intelligence in an effort to up-sell a different brand of a product I had previously purchased from them containing a lesser quantity at the same price. I spent a good bit of money at Healthy Planet on that visit, left to shop in the area and returned for some more organic produce that I could not find in the other stores. Big mistake, the same employee grabbed the bags of produce that I had selected, swung them up in the air and slammed them back down onto the counter. The staff at this location are not knowledgeable about the products in the store and they are rude.",negative
"Overpriced and cheap. I get emails from this place almost everyday, and the highest discount I've EVER recalled them having was ""10% off your purchase!!!* *purchase must be over $199.99.""",negative
"Yessssss FTR! Can't believe I beat Jen K and Johnny H haha. Healthy Planet is a healthfood grocer that has recently opened on the Danforth. It's very clean and organized and also houses an Organic Vegetarian Bistro/Salad bar and cafe. Fairly good selection of goods at similar pricing to other healthy/organic grocers, my one caveat though is that they do not have a dry baked goods department :( It's still too early to weigh-in too heavily on how good or bad HP is for now, but I'll definitely say the Gluten free treats offered from the Juice/Espresso bar are incredible!!",negative
"VERY expensive ($14 for a single piece of halibut, no chips) and on this visit the fish was overlooked and tough. The fries were also completely without taste.",negative
Very good quality fish and chips. I lived in Brampton for a bit and found this place and got hooked. I get the 2 piece haddock with half chips well done. I've had fish and chips all over the world and I always come back here!,positive
I had an order of haddock and onion rings. The fish was perfectly cooked and the batter is delicious and not too thick. The onion rings were cooked but i like them crispy. Still delicious. If i could give a half star i would have. Eaten here and the other Heritage locations in Brampton many times in the past. Always a good choice.,positive
"Fish and chips is great! Fishermans platter is not worth $17.99!! Felt really ripped off and I think I got more for our $8 fish and chips meal! They give you fish and chips plus 4 calamari pieces - Boourns! Not justifiable!! Cooks are kinda crusty to the cashiers, very comedic place to watch them argue over nothing ! Don't stray away from what they do best. Fish and chippies!!!!",negative
"I had the Pacific Halibut with fries here for dinner last nite. I have no idea why people would rate this a 4-star. I though it was more of a 2-star. I used the game out for my selection & also had a side of coleslaw. I found the coleslaw to be very dry. The chips were undercooked (even though I asked to have them well done-twice). Despite my request the fries were a little soggy. The Halibut was decent but the WAY more batter them fish. The flavour was very bland & even with the addition of generic tartar sauce it was barely passable. The other thing that really bugged me...no name ketchup. If you're gonna call yourself ""authentic fish & chips"" you need to have Heinz Ketchup with the fries!!",negative
"The fish is amazing! Great taste! Well cooked! The halibut was hot and tender! The scallops were perfectly cooked, though the batter tended to fall off. The shrimp was great - they had been trimmed so no hard tails. I also added a side of fried pickles, which were very tasty! I understand from another customer that the fried mars bar was very good! The only drawback to the meal was the chips, which are placed under the fish, was a bit soggy and not especially tasty. Felt they needed a bit more time and more seasoning. Overall, definitely recommend this, and will be back!",positive
"this place serves up great halibut and chips, a fairly large portio, not all batter and teh chips are good to......probably the best in Brampton, with multiple locations....",positive
"Wowza! Fantastic strip steak for $10.00 on Wed. Nights!! Cocktails are a good pour and the atmosphere is clean, warm and cozy! Highly recommended for a casual night out!",positive
"I pick this bar over any other local bar every time. You can't beat the price and atmosphere. Very clean, great bartenders, good food, music, and the game is always on. The owner is sweet as can be, but she has zero tolerance for baby momma drama in her bar. Music is kept at a minimum volume, and you can't swap out your french fires for a different side. Sometime you gotta play by the rules. If you're looking to participate in twerk fest 2017 this isn't your bar. The crowd is older, respectful, and regular Hunt's Bar attendees. One of my favorite bars in the Falls!",positive
Came here for drinks with a few friends when staying at the Sheraton for a wedding. Great local bar and reasonably priced drinks. Clean and warm atmosphere. Service was fantastic.,positive
"I prefer small, local bar/restaurant joints. So this is my kind of place. Small, quiet, friendly service and good food that won't break the bank. Six of us ate there not too long ago and their homemade chips with dip were delicious. We couldn't stop eating them. All of our entrees were good as well. Everything came out quickly and the price was right. The only minus for me was the beer selection. I'm a complete beer snob and there wasn't much in the way of wheat beer.",positive
"Great little place for drinks. Scott makes a great drink. I haven't tried the food there but it looks good and the price is right. I wish this bar were closer to home, I would be here every Friday night!",positive
"First time to IceHouse and we loved it! Brought my nephew and pup, and we had a great experience on the patio. Between the outstanding service from the start (our server brought water out for the dog without having to ask) to the delicious ribs, Mac and cheese, and tomato and basil bisque... we will definitely be coming back in the future!",positive
If I could leave 0 stars I would believe me I ate a quarter of a chicken breast and got charged 6.50 for did not like it at all had to see the worst experience I've ever had and I'm a chef and the quality of work that they put out it wasn't worth the price of the chicken breast sad to say this will be the only time and the last time but they will never get my business oh by the way you do get a free appetizer card though if you don't like your meal maybe I should sell it.,negative
The name is misleading. I was expecting a house made out of ice. Upon arriving I was disappointed to see just a regular bar. I thought I had the wrong address put in but when i asked around for an icehouse they said that was it. Food is good so it gets 3 stars,negative
"We aren't sports bar people, but we really enjoyed this place. Crazy good spicy tuna thingy I had. My 19-yr old son ordered some kind of gi-normous burger that had an egg on it and it was so impressive that a patron walking by had to stop and comment on it. I didn't think too much about their wings...I prefer Wing King in Fort Mill...but they were passable. We stopped in one day, starving, and found the entire place focused on the Carolina-Clemson game. Great atmosphere and we had a fun time, even though we are actually MN Gopher fans!",positive
"The family and I had traveled to Charlotte to check out the Ikea (which was an adventure in itself), and following our visit we searched for a pet friendly restaurant to have a dinner. One of the recommendations that had good reviews was the Icehouse South End. We arrived to find a semi-busy location with an outdoor patio where you could keep pets and enjoy a meal or drink. While the main idea of that statement was true... If you plan to dine on the patio, you need to be a smoker. If you are not, then don't plan to visit unless there is a steady breeze. Our family (including our two small dogs), spent the evening in a constant drift of second hand smoke. If that had been the only issue, I probably would have taken the 'live and learn' mentality and not written this review... but the situation got worse. After waiting about 10 minutes to even be greeted, we were told that it was a good thing we hadn't been taken care of yet because she ( our waitress Kandice) 'was the best'. We were actually excited to have someone with such a positive attitude. That attitude was short lived. While we did get our drinks, the first attempt wasn't correct. Again, maybe just a fluke situation. We continued to review our menus to decide what to eat. The selection is diverse and should offer most at least one or two dishes they would enjoy. We placed our order (probably 15 minutes after being asked the first time). Food came within another 15 minutes. Food was 'good' but nothing Special. Kandice managed to check with us just after the other staff had delivered our meals to the table and finally fixed the first drink issues and refilled the others that had been depleted. We didn't have her stop by again until at least 15 minutes after we had finished eating. In fact my wife and youngest daughter had left the table to keep themselves and our dogs from suffering the smokers overflow any longer. After finally dropping off our bill to the tables, again our waitress disappeared for at least another 10 minutes, and only then to return to serve other customers at the outside bar. I finally walked my bill up to the bar in person to finish the transaction. While I can't state it as confirmed fact, it seemed she only had four tables and then two or three customers at the bar she was tag-teaming service with another staff member. She didn't have a load that most wait staff couldn't easily balance with better intervals of check-in / refresh. So other pet enthusiasts be aware, while this establishment does permit the attendance of your pets on the patio; before you decide to try it out, understand the potential situation you may encounter. Here's to hoping our visit was the exception and not the rule.",negative
"Just went into Icehouse to watch football on a Sunday! Been going there for football on Sundays for close to a year. We spend $100-$150 each week. I'm sitting next to a few Steelers fans on the patio. My Bucs vs Steelers game is on a TV so we sit there. After a few minutes, the game gets changed? No big deal, we ask one of the waitresses to put it back. She rolls her eyes and walks away. 5 minutes later, the manager (he was a fan with a Bucs tattoo) walks over to us and says ""Im not changing any TV's."" No ""Hello"" or ""Can I help you guys""? Very aggressive, short and rude! I say ""The game was on and that's why we sat here."" He says ""Im trying to run a business here!"" Terrible way to treat a customer! I asked the bartender for my check and told her why I was leaving! She was sweet and apologetic! The Steelers group, who were sitting next to me, also asked for their checks to leave! I didn't even know them! One of the ladies said she was in the business (F & B) and said that manager was so unprofessional and out of line! Wr all took our business elsewhere because this manager was an absolute jerk! I will never, ever patronize Icehouse again! There are so many options to watch football uptown! Icehouse is not a place you should go!",negative
It was okay....nothing to write home about. I went on my lunch break and ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich which lacked flavor.,negative
Great patio. Perfect place to watch sports games. Food is good and variety on the menu. During football playoffs they put signs on the tvs of which games will be playing so you can sit accordingly. Busy place and staff does well handling the volume.,positive
"Great Wings/Nachos Now that we are a good ways into football season, I, like everyone else have two things I want to eat when watching these games. Wings and Nachos. I am giving Ice House a good review and rating on these two dishes for a few different reasons. I will start off with the wings. What makes them stand out? Well, they are not the little baby wings that you find at a lot of other places. They are always served right off the grill when you get them,( Yes they are grilled) and since they are not deep fried, you can actually taste the flavor of the chicken.(Not just the sauce) Let's face it, when you can get something so common like wings everywhere it takes something special for them to stand out. As for the Nachos....... I got the pulled pork nachos, which I split with one other person. The portion is large enough to suffice as a meal for two. Well, for must of us it is. The best thing about the portion size is that you are not having to dig through the chips to find all of the good stuff. I know when I get nachos most of the time everything is dumped on top of the chips. So once you eat the salsa,peppers, olives, guac, and whatever else is on there, you wind up with about 2/3 of your chips by themselves. At Ice House this is not the case.",positive
Had a GREAT time sunday watching the game! great atmosphere great service!!! Ask for Tiffany if you go she was terrific!!!!!,positive
"I bought a Living Social coupon to try this place out. The actual structure is very nice. Cool side of town, but the food and beer, which is why we went, was less than stellar. Pretty expensive without the discounts. The beer list was nothing to call home about. I could have gotten every beer at Harris Teeter. My ""CAROLINA BURGER"" was fine, not worth 9.99, that's for sure. Our waitress looked very bored and just did the minimum. I left a nice tip so she could cheer up for the rest of the night. But she definitely didn't earn it. No reason to return to this place, sorry to say. Side note: I know the economy is crap and most people are having a hard time. I want to help support local businesses, so when I go to a local business and see a 10$ hamburger, a 6$ bottle of beer and a staff that could care less if you're there or not. It makes me feel like staying home and not dealing with the aggravation.",negative
"Best steak salad ever!!!! Been searching for this and I found it! Amazing nachos as well! Service is alright, for sure don't go to be wowed by that :)",positive
"I love the patio at Icehouse on a nice night. The beer selection is good. The menu is varied. On my first visit I had the shrimp tacos, served with black beans and saffron rice. On my second visit I split an order of wings - half hot chili garlic and honey bbq. I like smoked wings, and they were a good size, so I was happy. I also got the curry chicken salad in a wrap, which was pretty salty (and I'm a salt lover) so I was a bit disappointed there. The curry flavor was great, as well as the toasted almonds and raisins, it was just oversalted. Living nearby I'm sure we'll be back as the evenings get even more beautiful.",negative
"I use yelp a lot for restaurant/bar recommendations....I have never taken the time to write my own review...but, unfortunately, I'm going to now. I'm in Charlotte from out of town, went to the Icehouse for drinks (did not order any food). THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BAR SERVICE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! The outside bar was NOT busy, but our service was slow, and sooooo rude. Chelsea ( the outside bartender) was clearly wasted. Spent her time at the end of the bar talking to her friend. Dropped, and broke, a whole,.bottle of vodka behind the bar then ran a lap around the parking lot ( not joking, she did). She was so rude to all of the patrons as they asked for their checks ( not just us) .. .....everyone, apparently interrupting her socializing with her friends at the other end of the bar. Sooooooooo.....food might be good here....INSIDE bartender is probably fine, but if you are there and Chelsea is trending bar....good luck to ya.",negative
"I went to Icehouse when they first opened last year and was not impressed. This weekend I decided to give them a second shot, and I am so glad I did. Their Cuban sandwich was absolutely amazing. I'll be going back time and time again for it. The chicken and black bean egg rolls are light on chicken, heavy on the beans and we loved them as well!",positive
"I chose to try out this place through a Groupon special. First impression...nice set up. Modern bar feel (digging the counter height tables); plenty of flat screen Televisions...all tuned in to sports :) There's an upstairs area that looks down upon the scene and also an outdoor sitting area. They had an outdoor space heater and a live band playing outside the night we were there (the lead singer sounded great by the way). We ordered a Spinach Artichoke Dip for starters and it was delicious. Sizzling hot and a little more creamier than other spinach dips that I have had in the past, with chunks of artichoke hearts. I ordered the Bacon Avocado Burger for my entree' and my bf had the pull pork plate (I uploaded some pictures) both were pretty good. The only downside to the entire experience was that our waitress was kinda slow. She bought our drinks and didn't done back for awhile...it was like that through the entire meal actually. All in all I enjoyed myself and will definitely be coming back for seconds.",positive
"Both times I have been there the food is average at best, definitely not great. Basically overpriced bar food. Waitress screwed up our orders this last time. Won't be going back, there are much better places.",negative
Not a bad place but can be slow service when packed. Food when we were there wasn't all that but we were told that they were in the middle of changing their menu so we will have to get back to check it out.,negative
"Icehouse is a great bar with a very strong sports bar look and feel to it. With all of the TV's on for the game, you're going to have a good time tossing back a few brews while the uniformed guys from one city get their butts handed to them by the other uniformed guys from the other city. I can't really vouch for the food (it looks both expensive and good), but the bar is well stocked and the bartenders are fast, friendly and efficient. Good times to be had here!",negative
"This is the happy hour spot of choice for my firm. They have a good beer selection and a lot of TVs to watch the game. Their hot wings are amazing and the tacos are also delicious. A great place to see a game, have a drink, and be with friends.",positive
"Great location and an awesome selection of beers. Plenty of TV's to watch a game, but unfortunately that is where it ends. Food sucks & the service isn't much better. Took my family there for lunch on a Saturday when it wasn't too busy to give it a second try (first time I went was with 15 buddies and since we didn't have a reservation, they didn't even try to accomodate us. Their loss as we just went down the street and dumped a lot of cash at McKoy's) With it not being too busy, I figured service was going to be attentive. Once our food was delivered, our waitress checked on us and then wasn't to be seen again. I was desperate for a drink after trying the fried pickles... or at least that is what I think they were before the cook decided to keep them in the fryer until they were puck-like. The wife got a Salmon BLT, which reminded me of the old Wendy's commercial, but only with salmon instead of beef. The miniscule portion of salmon was quite disappointing. The pulled pork sandwich wasn't much better and actually reminded me of Mac's... which has gone down hill FAST the past couple of years, but that is another review:)",negative
"HELLO BEER! This place was formerly known as the Southend Brewery and it hasn't really changed all that much. It has a HUGE selection of beer, so if you're a beer fan you'll want to step foot in this venue before any other. The people are great, super nice! It has a really cool modern feel to it. The food is pretty decent (they even made me a POUTINE, which is a Canadian delicacy... look it up... you won't be sorry) and overall I left very pleased. I'd definitely go back! Bring a sweater, they keep their AC on pretty high :)",positive
"In a small slice of the old gargantuan South End Brewery is Icehouse. Long gone is the beer making equipment as it was bought by Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. Luckily, Icehouse itself boasts an extensive list of craft and microbrews - so much so that's it difficult to decide. They have about 12 on tap that rotate and the same amount of seasonals. The waitress knew a little bit about beer, or at least acted like she did, so that was helpful. She was a good waitress - paying enough attention to us but also letting us enjoy our meal. The food was decent and reasonably priced. My burger was good, complete with fried pickles, and my side of veggies was nice and crisp. The wife's seared tuna tacos served with sides of beans and rice were also good. Icehouse is a cool little place in South End for a good meal, and if you're a beer snob, it's a must visit.",positive
"I've been here twice and I think it is a neat place. I like the fact that they have hightop and lowtop tables. Sometimes though, it is hard to see many tv's with where you are sitting (we went during NCAA tournament time for our first time), so that's not always the greatest for trying to watch several games at once. As far as the food goes. The first time I went there I had a chicken wrap, and it was pretty good. Last week on my return, my boyfriend and I split wings, bbq quesadillas, and fried pickles. The wings were pretty good, a very smokey taste, which I liked. The bbq quesadillas were excellent!!! I highly recommend those. The fried pickles were just blah, I didn't care for the taste of the batter but they were still okay. Good place and I will return, just not my favorite sports place.",positive
i went here for the first time yesterday and i was not that impressed. i was in the mood for a burger so i ordered there texmex burger. which i thought was gonna be different because of the guacamole but spicy because of the pepper jack cheese. NOT. my burger taste like a plain cheeseburger with wayy too much lettuce. i was kinda disappointed. on the bright side the vodka & redbull was $5 and they have a million flat screens so i was able to watch some basketball. our waitress was also really nice. i just wish there food was better because the location itself is great.,negative
"Good place for some beers (lots to choose from) while watching some sports games. Came on a Saturday night for the first stop of a self organized bar crawl and all the tables were full! So we just bum rushed the bar. Nice, open space with a lot of seating and many, many flat screens. Will have to venture back one of these days to try out the food. For future reference, it's 3 blocks from the East/West Blvd light rail stop, which is a block more than comfortable on a really, really cold night.",negative
"so i went there right when they opened and it left me @ meh.... then my lady friend who lives a block from it took me back there and it was really good, we went back again saturday night and i felt compelled to write a short review about how much i like the place, its bar its great. first time i went there i sat down at a table and got some weird jerk chicken deal...not good. last two times we have sat @ the bar and i have gotten the tune both times, it super super tasty and cooked perfectly, seared blackened crust with cool red/raw center exactly the way i like it. plus they have an absurd beer selection which melikey a lot. i'll probably end up frequenting this place and she likes it so go try it for yourself. i mean they have kronenbourg 1664 my favorite beer on menu, its a random french beer that i FN love",positive
"Pros: Great beer menu. Nice outdoor covered patio area with picnic tables. Cons: But inside lots of TV's and sports bar feel. And the acoustics suck. The food was mediocre. We had BBQ pork sandwich and blackbean & chicken quesadilla. Both were good, just not great",negative
"Arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other table seated (still early). The waitress took our drink order and returned quickly. She could have been friendlier but did her job well. Service was good. We ordered Teriyaki chicken wings ($5 for 6), Thai Beef Spring Rolls ($10 for 4) and a Pulled Pork Quesadilla ($9). The chicken wings were average size, grilled with good flavor but were a bit ""flabby"". We prefer our chicken wings crispy. Came with a few celery and carrot sticks and ranch dressing. Tasty but would not order again. On to the Thai Beef Spring Rolls........crispy, very tasty but small for the money.....1 inch by 3 inches. Menu says comes with spicy peanut sauce but we didn't get a peanut sauce, more like a sweet thai chili sauce. Would order again though. Finally the quesadilla was REALLY good, just the right amount of cheese, pork and onion served with salsa and sour cream. Would order again. The atmosphere is really beautiful inside with the blue lighting and high ceilings. I'm sure it must be packed during football season and they have PLENTY of flat screens. We would definitely return and try other items.",negative
"Oh noes, Icehouse. I was really excited to bring some out of towners to this new restaurant/pub seated in the heart of South End. The building itself is really neat - super tall ceilings, a nice patio facing South Blvd. and tons of super sweet flat screens inside. This would be a great place to watch a game...but not to eat...and here's why. Four of us were seated and ordered all different things off the menu - chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp and spinach quesadillas and I ordered the Thai beef salad. Even as we ordered, we thought that some of the menu items looked a little pricey as depicted. But, as this is a new restaurant we didn't quite know what to expect. The food came out very quickly - quite literally within 5-10 minutes, which was good. But the outcome was not. My mother ordered the shrimp and spinach quesadillas and upon tasting them, she put them down and asked me to try them. The spinach had a metallic, almost chemical taste to it. Within five minutes the waitress came over and she offered to bring her something else, later stating that too much oregano was reason that the quesadillas tasted strange. No offense, but I cook with oregano often, and that wasn't the odd taste. My husband's shrimp tacos were fine, but we took issue with the fact that for $12 - all he received were two small tacos with no sides. And my father's chicken tacos - $9 for the same. Even if these tacos were stellar (which per my dining mates they were just ok), that is a paltry amount of food for the price. The only decent item at the table was my Thai Beef Salad - the seasoning was nice, the mint was a pleasant touch, I just wish it had a little more spice. Portion wise it was more than enough. As a replacement to the spinach quesadillas, my mother ordered the Thai beef spring rolls and they were positively swimming in oil. Now, I don't mind a fried item, but lifting up a spring roll and finding a large pool of oil isn't appetizing to anyone. Needless to say, she didn't eat very much at lunch. On a brighter note, Icehouse has an extensive and affordable beer selection that would please just about anyone. Overall, I like the concept and the feel of Icehouse - plenty of brews and plenty of tvs. The food, however, fell waaaay short. I really hope that this place reevaluates its menu as the location and the concept have a lot of potential.",negative
"My husband and I read some great reviews about this bistro and decided to come over for lunch and we checked their website for the lunch special and opening hours. However when we came over, we realized that the bistro is not open until 5pm. We will definitely come back and try the food but strongly recommend others to call before coming in.",negative
"A genuine place. Wings special today and I tried the bbq and lemon pepper, both are pretty good. Waffle fries are crispy, just awesome. Owner Jake is super nice and gives honest opinions. Definitely one of the local gems",positive
"Service was very good and friendly. Unfortunately, food wise, this was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. It almost seems like their kitchen staff don't even have the basic fundamentals of cooking. Fettuccine Alfredo Fettuccine was over cooked and mushy. Alfredo sauce was watery and bland to the point where it was questionable whether the chef forgot the seasoning... French onion soup Onions were undercooked and crunchy? Monstrosity Burger For a restaurant that talks so much about their burgers and even has a separate section on their menu just for burgers this was the most disappointing. I can't believe a restaurant that does all this and has the audacity to charge $17 for this burger serves rubbery FROZEN patties! They do not even stack the burger properly. They put the lettuce and tomato between the bottom bun and the patty. This takes away from the mouth feel and the juice of the patty hitting your tongue first. It can be argued that they put the lettuce on the bottom to protect the bottom bun from being soggy but you totally fail at this once you put the tomato on the bottom. The bottom bun disintegrated and the whole thing turned into a mushy mess. Onion rings Best thing I tasted on the menu. However they were inconsistent. Some were perfectly thick and juicy yet others were thin and stringy. The onion was not sliced uniformly! Another example of how their food prep doesn't really stack up to ""restaurant"" quality. The onion rings really summed up the overall experience. Eating here was akin to going over to dinner at a friend's house who cooks a few things decently but does not have classic training or experience in a real kitchen. Which is ironic with their claims that their executive chef worked multiple years at the Octagon.",negative
The owner Jake actually served us that night. We didn't even know he was Jake until he introduced himself when we paid. Excellent service from beginning to end. Very personal. Gave samples of their local beer on tap. Good was great too. Overall a very good experience for a local diner. Would support again.,positive
Great service and yummy food! The place was packed on a Wednesday night and the one server handled it very well! Wings and burger tasted very fresh! Will definitely come back!,positive
"BONESHAKER should be advertised on their banner. We had a long conversation with Jake of Jake's about his new, what we call, ""gastro pub."" The kitchen is actually manned by Jake's uncle who's been at another restaurant for 22 years. And Jake, himself, has been in the restaurant business for almost his entire life. Born and raised in Germany with lots of experience in Toronto. Monique (our waitress and bartender) and Jake were so nice and offered us their honesty. We asked about their food and drinks they helped us decide what to get. Drinks: So I mentioned BONESHAKER which is one of my favourite craft beers and Jake has it on tap! They have a large variety of beers and wines and a cider and a raddler. Jake knows his beers and mentioned he wanted to make Jake's a haven for craft beer drinkers which I'm totally in for. Food: They have a great menu that specializes in steaks and seafood. Check out their site. I tried their Chicken Cordon Bleu with garlic bread, grilled veggies and sweet potato fries. The fries with chipotle were on par with most other sweet potato fries. Grilled veggies were good and so was the bread. The chicken was stuffed with a slice of ham and cheese, breaded and smothered with the chef's mushroom - wine gravy/reduction. It was slightly too salty and was on the small side (4oz-6oz). Jake asked me what I thought and I told him 7.75/10. This place is a great new spot in Richmond Hill and it will hopefully open up some mouths to the craft beer scene. Once you taste the complexity craft beer can bring vs. your regulars, I'm sure you'll not want to go back. Grab the yelp deal and try it!",positive
"I have been to Jake's Bistro + Bar a few times and I've never been disappointed.. The food is always outstanding, filling and definitely worth the good price! I would recommend it to anyone living in the area! The service is also excellent! Take a look at some of the food I have eaten there :)",positive
"I ambled in to this bistro for the first time about a week ago. I was in the middle of moving, and I was hungry! Because it was around 2 in the afternoon, there were not a lot of people there. I was eating alone, so I sat at the bar, and chatted with one of the owners and the server. The customer service was outstanding, but the cheeseburger was out of this world, and at a $7 price, very reasonable! Even though I was leaving town, I will be back for another cheeseburger, and I will bring my appetite because this burger is big! I was informed by the owner that all the food is made in-house from scratch, and I could tell by the way he discussed the various menu items that a lot of care goes into the food here!",positive
"2.5 Star $7 lunch Special with a good selection of wings, burger, sandwich and more. Jakes Bistro+Bar is a good place for lunch at this price point. Craft Beer Selectuon includes Amsterdam Boneshaker and Mill Street 100th Meridian. Too bad I need to work after lunch. I ordered a burger to celebrate #Nationalburgerday which maybe a mistake... Cheese Burger ($7) + Onion Rings ($2) I made a mess eating because it was super super greasy. Oil was dripping dripping all over the place even before I bite into the burger. Patties are not made in house, maybe they can try sourcing it somewhere else? or try cooking it on the grill for a little longer? I did have an urge to go into Snap Fitness next door to run 10 miles on their treadmills after ultra greasy food. I will come back for a drink at least beer selection is good. There is daily special including Happy Hour with Appetizer specials everyday.",negative
"Ordered two items, food came out fast and hot. Taste was ok, nothing special. All of the booths were worn and torn. Definitely needs some renovations.",negative
Went to this location today and ordered one of the fill up boxes and got plastic inside my chicken! I am so disgusted and will never return to this location. Small strands of plastic cooked into my meat like the edge of a bag.,negative
This place is a joke. They have gotten their last dollar from me. I had a coupon for 9 piece of MIXED chicken for $12.00. I got home and I had 5 legs and 4 thighs. Why don't you say legs and thighs instead of MIXED. I expected to at least get a wing or breast.,negative
"My order was fast and food was okay. However I wanted to leave right away because of the smell, old fish shop smell. There was no outside sitting so I ate fast as I can and left. Some sittings were tore up too.",negative
"SLOW! Seats are torn, semi clean. They never answer the phones if you want to call in an order or need info. Music is too loud, staff can't hear orders correctly. Staff are not friendly.",negative
"Ok KFC is done in my books. I don't know how they manage to stay open because it has become a joke. So over the last 5 years I say I have went to maybe KFC 8 times. In those 8 times, all 8 times, they did not have any dark meat left. You are a chicken place, YOU SHOULD HAVE FREAKING CHICKEN IN A CHICKEN PLACE! Every time I had to get white meat. I like dark meat because it taste way better to me. Anyways I went to this KFC and the same thing happened. I was just soooooo annoyed. I told them to just shove it. Yea I shouldn't had said that, but it's beyond frustrating when that happens every time you go. So I went to another KFC. Here is the link of that review. I see why they are falling behind other chicken places. https://www.yelp.com/biz/kfc-apache-junction?hrid=tSWhirzevpKosSGvbKg45g",negative
"First, do not believe the sign on the door about their operating hours. It says the dinning room is open until 9:00pm. I arrived at 8:20pm and found the front door locked. This was a Monday night. I should have known something was amiss because I saw 3 employees in the parking lot tossing a football around. The next afternoon I returned around 4:00pm. I order 5 pieces of original, a large slaw and a small box of wedges. I requested 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs and a breast. The drumsticks and thighs had more breading on them than chicken. The breast coating was over cooked and the chicken was very dry. The potato wedges tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp since lunch time. The cole slaw turned out to be the best part of the meal. They are so overpriced for what you get it is laughable. KFC used to mean good quality chicken at a reasonable price. Not anymore. Too many good chicken places around to have to settle for this.",negative
Very rude male cook. I told him my chicken was overdone snd he said that's perfect. No customer service w him at all. Rude.,negative
Super high prices for chicken and non of the food has a fresh taste. Taste like it's been sitting under the heater for a while. The biscuits are hard enough to be used as baseballs. Been here once and they were out of a few things. For as much as it cost i expect more. Do yourself a favor and go to any grocery store and get chicken and sides for half the prices.,negative
Last night was the second time I have come to this place and they have no original recipe chicken. Really?? A Kentucky Fried Chicken with no chicken!? They tried to push the crispy chicken on me but I said no. They said I would have to wait then. I left.,negative
"My husband and I went to this kfc to pick up a quick chicken dinner. The person taking our order was friendly and offered suggestions. The establishment was very clean and we got our food with in minutes of ordering. The chicken dinner dinner and pot pie meals we had were very good. We were pretty surprised that the reviews were so poor. Considering we eat out a lot and seldom at fast foods restaurants, this was a very acceptable dinner.",positive
"The problem here is not really the food. It's KFC, if you like their fare, you're in luck. The problem here is the employees. They hold that delicious chicken hostage! Tonight, I waited 25 minutes to place my order in the drive thru. The girl on the other end of the mic, Jordan, couldn't get the simple order correct to save her life. I pulled forward, or tried to, and in another 20 minutes, made it to the window. That's where the fun began. Jordan was pretty surely. I don't like that. She corrected my order, yelled at the cook to add what she had forgotten, and gave me my food. No apology for waiting 45 minutes. No silverware. No napkins for my finger lickin' fingers. No sauce for the chicken strips. I asked if she had any sauce, she said yes, if I asked for it. That's when I lost it. I went into the restaurant and spoke to the manager, a nice lad, who might be able to shave in a year or so. He told me he would ""discipline"" Jordan. I looked over at her smirking face, and noticed her drive thru stand was full of food crumbs and she had a beverage with a straw. She rolled her eyes some more, and I called her a brat. Mature? No. However, I feel it was justified. After all, I just lost 45 minutes of my life waiting for her to hand me my chicken. Moral of the story...it's a KFC, and the food is fine. However, the agravation of having to deal with snotty teenagers, and wasting my time is not worth it, and I'll never go there again.",negative
They're supposed to open at 10am. I arrived around 11:15 and one of the workers was outside and told me they were closed because a manager never arrived. Unacceptable.,negative
"Went inside to get food for carry out, Got home and ate was pretty good, a little greasy and the buns were hard, Lid had come off of gravy and made a mess. No napkins or sporks, Put left overs in the fridge, ate for lunch the next day and found a black curly hair in the breading of my chicken, WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN NASTY",negative
My Bad- I should know better to peek inside my order before leaving especially when it was processed and put together so fast - that should have been a red flag. I get home to serve dinner for my family and this bucket of chicken was so greasy and looked like it has been sitting under a warming light all afternoon. We won't go back.,negative
Broke a tooth on their product in October 2015- it literally sheared my back tooth in two. To date no one has returned my calls regarding this matter,negative
Not even worth 1 star! This place was awful! Dining area was filthy. Food was cold. Biscuit was rock hard. Restrooms were foul! Food prep areas were a mess. Im hoping a video will post on here soon.,negative
"Ran in to get a side of mashed potato with gravy. Total came to $4.31. I am totally ok with paying more for convenience. Then I saw $4.70 on my receipt. ""We charge more for debit card orders."" Wow, really? I did not see a sign declaring that anywhere in the store. Nor was I told before I hand over my card. I am not happy for being blind-sided with extra charge. 40 cents is not a lot, but it adds up. Plus, you will think they should at least mention it before they put it on the charge. It is for sure I will not go back.",negative
"I would very much rather go to KFC when I want chicken, than to any other chicken place. However them not having biscuits at 630pm is unacceptable. The biscuits are the best part. Highly disappointed, get it together guys!!",negative
"I went thru drive thru tonight and was absolutely disgusted at what I saw. While we were waiting at window to pay and get food, the guy getting our drinks filled up our cups using the ice that was sitting in the catch-all tray under the fountain machine. I could not believe my eyes. When the other guy came to window to collect money I immediately said I am not taking those drinks because he just filled up the cups with ice from the nasty tray under the fountain machine. All he said was ""ok"" with a shit grin on his face. I told him he was gonna give me 3 empty cups and i would go inside to fill myself. He said he would give to me when I came inside. I said you will give them to me now, which he did. Then of course, I got home and realized I paid with cash and he so conveniently forgot to give me my receipt. So here I am signing up for my first yelp review. I will never eat here again!",negative
"Quick service, fresh food, just wish that they had the A&W back. The A&W on tap and cheese curds here were fantastic. Oh well, whats done is done.",negative
"nice atmosphere, nice music, they are very attentive. very nice customer service. the food is not the best though. ***update*** i woke up the next morning at 3 am and threw up those shrimp tacos... i usually don't have any reactions with shrimp, but there is something they are doing that is definitely not good.",positive
"My husband Yelp this place and figure it has good reviews, why not try it out. Well, I order the Meat Molcajete. I know this place is know for sea food, but wanted to try out the Meat Molcajete. My advice to everyone is, DO NOT order the Meat Molcajete. On the menu it stated it comes with chorizo, but it was hot dogs. The menu did not mention anything about intestines (tripas), but my Meat Molcajete came with it. Also, when asked for a plate, I was given a disposable plate. Did not enjoy my meal. On a positive note, their micheladas were good.",negative
"Have always been a fan of this place when visiting from out of town. The food is great, except the customer service does need some help. Perhaps they were just a little short staffed. Agauchiles, oysters, shrimp tacos is what I had :)",positive
The worst. We place our order and it took over an hour .We asked for more drinks since our food was taking so long and they never came we had to ask 3 time for them.. and our food still didn't arrive. It was the worst we came here because it was recommended to us but the service is horrible.,negative
"I must say food is food and is always good... but the service in here is like the worst thing ever... how can you tell the customer ""let me see if i can find tortillas""... Like are you kidding me is a Fu*** restaurant...! Anyways they took like forever to serve me a drink and to take our order... and the excuse of having a full house doesn't work on me... hire more staff to serve...First and last time i come here to eat...! Good luck!",negative
"Food is on point the mango shrimp was amazing. They are not stingy with portions and flavored to perfection The atmosphere was great, real lively definitely recommend this spot if your looking fir good sea food and a fun experience.",positive
I was not a fan of this place. Not many people spoke English and the food was not that great. I ordered enchiladas I wanted to try a few different meats but they told me I would have to have all them the same I was not a fan of that. I feel they should have at least let me pay extra to have my food the way I wanted it. I got steak and it was a little over cooked the meat was very tough. The plate came with rice which was just white rice noting special the beans were the best thing on my plate and they tasted like they came out of the can. I don't recommend this place there are to many better places to eat,negative
"Horrible food, came with a group of ten people and not one plate was edible. Beans were flavorless with an odd smell. Rice was dry, shrimp over cooked. Sampled all plates and wouldn't recommend any.",negative
"Worst service ever! Sat down waited 15 min before walking out no one acknowledged us. Waiters passed by ignoring our group. Another group came in after us, smaller group they were seated and served and we continued to wait. I guess no one wanted to wait on a big group.",negative
"Food is good a bit over priced, service is really bad. They need more staff it took us over 20 minutes to get refills on drinks. If you're a female be ready to be checked out by all the guys there, most are always tipsy. Some will even send you drinks & they don't care if you're with someone.",negative
"My sweet mother wanted Mariachi! My sweet mother got Mariachi! My gorgeous father wanted coffee... damn straight he got coffee! Even if it meant the manager had to run across the street to get him some! This is the restaurant my mama chose to celebrate out here in Vegas! She's been to the other locations but came here because they had the Mariachi and didn't have a crazy 2 hour waiting time! Unbeknownst to my sister she used handy-dandy Yelp to find it(she went through google! I know the horror)! Came to check out the location and made the reservation! We arrived and were seated immediately! Tables were already set up and just had to add a couple more as more family members showed up! Had drink orders and appetizers on the table quickly! Had Mariachi music blaring in my ear! It was great! :) Finally our food arrived! My niece and I both ordered the Seafood Molcajete and the Carne Molcajete! So we could taste each others dish! They were huge! Everything was delicious! Everything we ordered was great! The oysters, Agua Chiles, and an appetizer with avocado and shrimp that was really good! Great service from the waitress! She was very quick with our requests and dishes! The Mariachi was great too! 15 dollars a song! You bet they were singing their hearts out! The FIVE stars? When my dad wanted coffee... The restaurant doesn't serve COFFEE! When the manager found out he took it upon himself to go get some across the street just for my pops! No complaints! We had a great night!",positive
"My family and I usually come here because it's the only place we can all agree with the food choices here. Been coming here for a couple of years and not had changed. The food is decent nice proportions ok priced. We normally get shrimp ceviche, shrimp coctel, and oysters. This time around my mom got some fish tacos which looked really good. The shrimp empanadas are also pretty good. The only thing I hate about this place is when they have music. They got a jukebox and most of the time 2 or so groups playing music. If you're sitting in the middle you can hear the jukebox and the bands playing. All that makes it so loud you have to talk very loud for the people to hear you.",positive
We are casino workers. .party of 6. Happy Hour. Horrible service! Bland food! We payed our bill with out question. My drink came after my meal! ! Server was horrible! Don't waste your money! Great LOUD music.,negative
"Mixed reviews for this place since it depends on the kind of seafood you're used to eating and who you ask... I ordered a Tostada De Camaron (cosido) and Tostada De Ceviche (de camaron) However, I didn't eat the ceviche since it was straight raw shrimp! Don't get me wrong, I love a good shrimp ceviche but it has to be marinated in lime juice (aka ""cooked"" in the citrus) But if you're ok with the raw shrimp, you'll probably love it. The presentation of it was perfect, with red onions & avocado... The actual cooked camaron tostada was horrible!! No flavor whatsoever!! No salt, no lime, no salsa, nothing!! It simply taste like they just boiled the shrimp in water and threw it on the tostada with chopped cucumbers and tomatoes... I must've added at least 4 lemon slices with half a tsp of salt and still did nothing to give that tostada any flavor... Huge Disappointment!!",negative
Terrible service! Over an hour wait to get our food. The waiter had an attitude. The food was poor quality. Beverages are served in plastic cups. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Not coming back!,negative
"Its a good place to eat but very loud, but the food is amazing. The parking is ok. They cook the fish great, the cocktails are made beautifully with just the right amount of lemon and salt.",negative
The pasta bravo is absolutely delicious and empanadas are uhhhhhhhhhhh so bomb. If you're not used to the culture you might say it's loud. But I say it stays popping.,positive
"Well I've beeb wanting to try here for a while me and my 3 friends got off work early and went . Im glad I did!! Michelada delicious :). Oysters wonderful, shrimp cocktail yummy! & aquachiles first time trying definitely would get it again and my friend let me try her shrimp tostadas definitely spicy but want more. Only thing that kept it from 5 stars the band was nice just to loud our great waitress could hardly hear us. Overall I'll be back . Way more i want to try.",positive
"Oysters were not fresh. Between two, we ordered a dozen and my partner and I only had 2 each. I was afraid to get food poisoning . The Camarones con aguacate are delicious but beware...they cost $28!!! Definitely not worth the price.",negative
"I have heard about this place for years but never made it here until this year finally!!!! This place feels and looks like you've just gone to Mexico. I order a molcajetes it came out still cooking, it was so good. They have the best micheladas I have ever had!!!!! This place is definite worth the stop but next time I would stop there on the way to Vegas rather than on the way home.",positive
"The live music would be nice if it wasn't played over a speaker system that leaves your head pounding and your ears hurting. I sat down and ordered my drink, the waitress could barely hear what I was saying due to the music being so loud so I had to tell her 3x times I wanted a coke. She ended up bringing me a modelo. I ordered my food, the food came out wrong. I ordered a glass of water that I never got. The waitress never came back to our table until we had to run her down to pay our bill. This place is way over priced and the food is not all that great. The customer service was probably the worst I have had in awhile. Definitely won't be back!",negative
"This place is garbage.. my sister in law had a shrimp cocktail that was not cooked correctly. And she got food poisoning. .and had to be take to the ER.. They did not take any responsibility to help or call the ambulance and they did not even want to give us water.. that's to show how guilty they are.. the food was garbage. . We paid for the food and we told them and they refused to take the shrimp cocktail off the bill. . Their agua chile was even worse. Wads just a bunch of lemon with no seasoning. . I'm not posting out of hate, I've eaten here before but the class and responsibility they showed today showed us how guilty they are...",negative
This place is delicioso! Their Ceviche de Cameron is bliss. Their Oysters prepadoras are even better. Home made Salsa with tostada shells and Micheladas! Yum. Don't forget to try their cheese empanadas!,positive
Good food but not worth the price.... customer service was horrible. Never asked if we needed anything. .. definitely won't go back,negative
"Have had their carne asada plate, their quesadillas, camarones a la diabla & their breaded shrimp & I have to say its probably one of the best Mexican seafood restaurants in town(not to mention I can walk there from where I live). It's also across the street from Freedom Park so you can always take a walk after you're done eating.",positive
"Very dirty, noisy, the ac unit on the side of the bar area was leaking on me they did not serve my drinks first after all that 20 minutes of waiting I got up and left maybe it was just that one in a million but no I will never return.",negative
"First time and last time! Service was terrible, the food was terrible, and the prices were way too high. Shrimp was not cooked all the way and fajitas had no flavor... We had a group of 8 people and only two of the 8 got what they ordered. The waiter kept blaming the cook, but I think the waiter wrote the order all wrong...he wrote the order on a napkin and in a rush!?!?",negative
"Crazy how much their menu prices have increased throughout the years but even with that said, I continue to come back. In the north side of town, sketchy corner of Pecos and Washinton but this place is worth every penny! This place has earned bragging rights I must say. Their shrimp ceviche is BOMB-BAY! Fish Tacos-BOMB, Fried Fish Fillet-BOMB, Everything-BOMB! Need to say more?..... Atmosphere: Here's the kicker....the live band/mariachi guys are ANNOYING! It is SO flipping loud to the point where you cannot hear the person sitting next to you. These guys are part of a soliciting army that goes in there while you are looking through the menu and waiting on food. You have the custom made jewelry lady, the deaf/blind guy asking for donations, the bootleg CD guy, the charity chocolate kid, and the flower girl all at the same time trying to sell you goods...it's like waiting to cross the border into San Diego. Then you have the Paisas who want to eat you/undress you with one look. Very uncomfortable. But I promise the meal will be all worth it! ;-)",positive
"*The seafood here is really good. I know I've had better though. I did not like the fish civiche tostada... so stay clear of that. But everything else is awesome. *Almost always busy, the wait time to be seated could be a while but people still wait. You can tell the employees want to get their customers seated as quickly as possible. *There's live mariachi playing so this is no place to have an extensive conversation with someone... it is however, great for charades and miming. More like a big happy family eatery. *The waitress we had would take a bit, but that just may be because of how busy it was when we went (Sunday). They did take our drink and food order quickly. *Food presentation is fantastic, they use different kinds of platters, bowls and even a big Mexican mortar is used to serve some dishes.",negative
Seafood/Fish is a food I'm trying to eat more of. I recently had family in town and a cousin of mine that lives here recommended this place to my brother-in-law. So we drove to the Mariscos Las Islitas on North Pecos. It is located in the Town Square shopping plaza. I wasn't sure what to expect but since I was trying to discover seafood I figured what the heck. I was blown away not only by the portions but by how delicious the fish was. I had the grilled salmon. The menu confused me a bit. I thought I had ordered something else but was so glad I got what I did. The fish was tender and the grilled parts of the fish added that fresh grilled taste from a bbq grill. It was accompanied with rice with veggies mixed in (sooo good) and with steamed vegetables. I couldn't eat it all so I brought the rest home. I have been craving more fish since then. The only thing I didn't care for was the guys (musicians) looking to perform while you ate. Once you tell them no thank you they leave you alone. Not a deal breaker to have them there I just don't care for it. The prices may be a little intimidating. I paid $15.00 for my grilled salmon. While a bit on the pricey side for my range I was ok with it since I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back.,positive
"Went a Thursday night with a friend, was the last night for our groupon coupon. I don't even know where to start. The restaurant seems to be very confused what tapas. Being server raw veggies and some sort of sour cream dip IS NOT a tapas!! Something so amateurish to serve. That last dish some potato cake that I guess is suppose to be a spin on a Spanish torta, was cold, mushy and left the worst after taste. My friend left with such a bad case of heartburn, they use canned tomatoes for all their dishes and out of the 11 tapas there must have been 7!! However the service was great! Our waitress was amazing, super attentive.",negative
Went in May with a Groupon coupon and it was pretty good and friendly. Fod was Ok for most part.... Stopped by a few weeks ago (in the middle of Summer..) and they were closed for vacation .... As I had another Groupon coupon I called (cell phone..) to reserve last week. The mailbox is full and they don't respo9nd to msg either ... Not sure how long the place is going to last.,negative
"Le Roy pendu, vive le Roy! Petit restaurant de quartier (quoique...) hyper charmant, on nous reçois ici dans une déco rustique un peu kitch mais qui fontionne très bien. Le menu se compose de plusieurs plat en format tapas et de quelques plats en portion plus généreuse. On offre une carte ecclectique passant du carpaccio de betterave, au risotto en passant par les calmars frits... Mais ça marche. La formulaire simple et complexe à la fois (en gros on peut tout prendre, ou faire différente combinaison, ou y aller avec des formules déjà faite) vous sera expliqué par la très charmante et gentille hotesse. Elle est d'une gentillesse et tout simplement super sympa. Bon, retournons à la nourriture, les plats sont tous (et je crois les avoir effectivement tous essayer) très réussi. Le boeuf autant en tartare qu'en plat principale y est excellent. Il faut y retourner régulièrment et encourager ce type d'établissement.",positive
"Me and a friend ended up here for brunch after the restaurant we had originally chosen was too full and we were too hungry to wait. Let me first start off by saying that the bar tables, were spring loaded. What does that mean? It means that for some bizarre reason, the designer of the restaurant decided to build tables that are on springs....that move when you press on them. This isn't really awesome for eating and drinking. I was spilling and splashing my drink all over the place and It was essentially impossible to rest my elbows or hands on the table without everything moving. I really just am having a hard time understanding the reasoning behind this decision. It seems there are some regular tables in other areas of the restaurant so at least you aren't forced to endure this strange experience. The food was also a bit disappointing. I ordered a standard poached eggs with hash browns, sausage and fruit. The eggs were a bit soupy and there weren't very many potatoes that came with the meal. I asked for hot sauce and all they had was Tabasco. I love my eggs with proper good hot-sauce and in my opinion any good breakfast/brunch spot should ensure that have it. The saving grace were the toasted baguettes that came with the meal, perfectly toasted and buttered and the nice assortment of fruit as well. But those items were secondary to what I ordered. Maybe I just caught this place on a bad-day in terms of the food and I suppose I could have asked to change tables but this experience overall wasn't great and I doubt I will be back.",negative
"I had brunch here the other day, it was great! The serving was humongous, yet reasonably priced. The omelet was tasty and healthy. The fruit was super fresh. The ambiance and staff were nice, I'll be back!",positive
"This was Italian heaven and I am an Italian food snob. I have to say if you can, just walk here. Was a pain to park in the garage but they do validate your ticket. We have a baby so we would have preferred to just walk. Anyway! Gorgeous quaint little restaurant. We had a reservation but were seated right away and we chose outside because of the wonderful weather. Definitely had the prosecco. The beans served with the bread basket was right up my ally. We started with the buratta which was sooooo creamy on top of country bread with pomodoro. We also had the roasted asparagus with Parmesan and prosciutto. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and paired with the prosciutto it was a perfect combination. For dinner, i had the Mare. It was housemade linguini served with pretty much every fish imaginable. Lobster, clams, muscles, scallop, calamari etc. I couldn't stop eating. My boyfriend had the Buttera. A tubular pasta similar to rigatoni with sausage and peas in a creamy tomato sauce. It was so delicious I really can't put to words. Their pasta is all made their. You can taste the quality. It is cooked to a perfect al dente. For dessert we had a panna cotta that was sublime with the perfect bounce and creaminess. Served with fresh berries. We got cannolis to go. Please go here. I'm 100% Italian and it took me right back to my time spent there.",positive
What a perfect evening! The service is friendly without being intrusive at all and professional without being stuffy. Wonderful ambience for a special dinner. Food is prepared perfectly and absolutely delicioso. Pasta is delicate and al dente as is the lobster risotto. Ricotta cheese cake... Yum. Don't miss this special gem of Italian dinning!,positive
Tasty Italian food and great formal restaurant for a business lunch or date night. Chef was nice to accommodate my low carb request and I enjoyed the seafood linguini but switched pasta out and in were vegetables. Service was great as well!,positive
"Best restaurant in Charlotte. Manuela was the waiter. I think he is the owner but not sure. I had pasta that was spiced up (I like spicy food), salad, and chocolate mousse. Usually, I have Italian red wine but I could not pass up a pinot noir especially from Oregon. Service was outstanding. Everything was great. It was calm and relaxing.",positive
"Fresh, fantastic penne with porcini and veal. Great pre-show experience, tucked in a corner near Hearst tower. I also had a Manhattan (well done) and an arugula side salad, very nicely dressed in lemon and herbs. Wine bottles were reasonable, though the list seems out of date. Service was great, they gave us a complimentary semifreddo for dessert. Can't wait to go back!",positive
Excellent! Went for a team dinner from work and everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the Mare and it was very good. Good wines as well.,positive
The service started out a little slow. Once we got our beverages the service picked up. The food was delicious. Their antipasto special was heavenly and the pasta I had was delicious too. We also ordered Bruschetta and it was good but not something I will order again. Yes we will go back!,positive
"Went here for restaurant week- I had the garganella pasta as my main meal which was delicious. My crudo and cannoli- so-so. The thing that turned me off from this restaurant was the service. It's not that they weren't attentive, but when asked to tell me about the menu, they were almost condescending... ""what do you want to know about it."" Most places I've been that have restaurant week go over their menu, tell you their favorites or recommendations, etc. Not this place. I won't be back again, the food wasn't good enough to entice me.",negative
"The architecture of the building is stunning, the high ceilings make you feel as if you can breath and then the food was superb!! Artful and simple at the same time. I had a delicious pasta starter of homemade linguini and crab and meyer lemon just exquisite!!! I had the lamb as my main entree, again another winner. The pasta was the standout and I would have it as my main dish next time. Lunch was an outstanding value.",positive
Food was good but service was very slow. We had a reservation but still had to wait 30 mins.for a table. Went to the bar for a drink in the mean time and had to wait much longer than normal to get our drinks. This was a business dinner with out of town associates so a little embarrassing. I Assume The Restaurant Was understaffed for a full house on a Wednesday,negative
"By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. While the price point limits how often we can visit, the service is excellent and the food is amazing.",positive
"The lasagna was TO DIE FOR! We went before dinner rush on a Saturday and were seated right away, the place quickly filled up with what seemed to be regulars, which is odd since it seems to be in a business area. Lasagna and a glass of wine! Sit on the patio if it's nice enough outside.",positive
"My wife and I went last night for a ""date night"" and were very pleased. Very romantic, quiet, well-decorated. The bar was comfortable and they had a great selection and service (friendly but not too chatty). The staff was overall what really made this experience so good. Every person was friendly, knowledgable, and fun. The dinner was very good although we didn't care too much for the flash-fried calamari. We would absolutely recommend this wonderful restaurant and will be coming back.",positive
"My husband and I ate here before seeing 'Book of Mormon'. Everything was great - food, service, etc. We don't eat out often at nice places anymore, so it was a relief to have a good experience that was worth the money. We tried the lobster bisque,homemade ravioli (I ordered the plain cheese, old-school version because I knew it would be good), osso buco (my husband always orders this if it's on a menu), and Chilean seabass (this used to be my go-to dish but since it's now overfished and politically incorrect I try to abstain). Accompanying risotto was good. My only complaint was that there were no veggies on the plates (although you could order spinach as a separate side). Maybe restaurants have moved away from this because people don't eat them and they go to waste. I highly recommend Luce for an excellent pre-show dinner.",positive
"My husband and I caught a movie at the epicentre and then walked down to Luce for dinner. (Note- I don't ever suggest anyone eating at Studio Movie Grill, only because the service is so bad. We just go to the bar to get our drinks, it's so much faster than ordering them from the servers). We had never been to Luce but had heard good things- and it lived up to our expectations! This is hands down the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Charlotte. We started with the Prosciutto e Mozzarella, which also had a little arugula salad with it. The mozzarella literally melted in your mouth! We split a bottle of Pinot Noir- I can't remember which one but our server recommended it. For dinner my husband had the Buttera and I had the Mare. Both were excellent, and we had enough leftover to take home for lunch the next day. I would highly recommend Luce!",positive
"The food is pretty good. The beans and bread they serve is pretty tasty. I had the gnocchi which was pretty delicious, though my fiancé wasn't so much of a fan of his seafood pesto pasta dish. We also enjoyed bruschetta as our appetizer, good, although not phenomenal. We also enjoyed great customer service! The next time we are in the mood for Italian, Luce will be on our list.",positive
"Luce is a beautiful restaurant with amazing food and service. It was the perfect choice for our anniversary. The salad with goat cheese and poletna appetizers were amazing! The rigatoni buttera was scrumptious and the tiramisu, my favorite dessert, was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.",positive
"We visited Luce this past Saturday evening for dinner. I thought that Luce had taken over the old Coco Osteria space along Tryon St so when we arrived and it said Malabar, we were confused. I quickly pulled out my phone to check the address. The addresses matched. Knowing that there is a courtyard right there, we decided to explore a bit further back. That's when we noticed Luce tucked way back in the left corner right next to the Hearst Tower. It's certainly not the most visible location for a restaurant. We booked a reservation on OpenTable.com and when we looked inside the windows and saw the crystal chandeliers and other decor, we had our doubts. We thought maybe it was skewed to a much older crowd than us and we didn't want a ""stuffy"" experience, only a great meal. After debating, we finally decided to go ahead with the reservation. I'm so glad we did. Our table wasn't quite ready yet when we checked in, but we were led to the bar area to sit and wait. We were promptly greeted by the bartender at our high-top table and he offered us drinks. I tried a red wine from Sicily I had never heard of before. It was an excellent choice. It wasn't too dry or bitter. It was just right and I really enjoyed the BIG glassful that the bartender poured. We sat and enjoyed our wines until our table was ready. We were seated and promptly greeted by our server, Fabio. Everyone with whom we came into contact was very friendly and seemed authentically Italian, as if English wasn't their first language at all. All of the appetizer options sounded delicious, but we ventured with the imported italian FORMAGGI (cheeses) with marinated olives. We ordered the larger version of the appetizer (they have small and large versions for about half of the items -- appetizers and entrees -- on their menu). We received a cupful of green olives and four triangle slices each of five different cheeses, along with some crisp bread slices. It was definitely more than enough for two to share. The harder cheeses had more flavor than the softer ones. We were also brought fresh slices of bread and a bowl of a whole cannellini beans mixed with olive oil and other flavorful ingredients complimentary for each table. It was so simple, yet so delicious. Next came the entrees. I didn't want anything with red sauce, so I opted for something new: AGNOLOTTI. Agnolotti apparently is ""ravioli."" In each ravioli was roasted veal and swiss chard, and then covered in a brown ""butter, sage, and jus de veau sauce."" It was freakin' AMAZING. And that wasn't just the effect of the delicious red wine. My partner tried the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was very rich and creamy, covered in a white sauce. Unfortunately, after all that bread, beans, cheese, and pasta, we did not have room for dessert. The cannolis were very tempting, though. For a final good, lasting impression, our server brought us complimentary shots of deliciously sweet limoncello. Upon leaving, we were thanked and told goodbye by several of the waitstaff, as if we were family. It was a fantastic, authentically Italian experience, and I look forward to returning soon! p.s. When our reservation was confirmed on OpenTable, it said that if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage, you get two free hours of parking with a validated ticket from Luce during lunchtime hours, or ""free"" with validated ticket on evenings and weekends. We took this to mean that you could park for more than two hours for free, but when we got our validated ticket, it was marked as ""two hours."" Unsure with the conflicting information, we left and found free parking elsewhere to walk around Uptown. So...I really don't know what the correct parking situation is there. But at least two hours is free!",positive
"We came here for restaurant week. Their 3 course meal menu had a wide variety for the occasion. Upon walking in, it wasn't what I thought it would be. It was smaller than what I imagined, but that was expected after looking at where it was located. Under the Hearst Tower. Now, I imagine this place to be a local place to go to for office workers after a day at work and want to go to drink at a bar. For me, I think the only reason why I'm here is because its during restaurant week (and I thought the menu looked tasty, and I felt like eating italian.) On another note, the seats weren't extremely comfortable, but it was doable. For appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. It also had fried vegetables, except it was in a string form. My mother ordered the grilled octopus with capers sprinkled on top which I thought it was well cooked and tasty. My brother ordered a salad as an appetizer as well. For the entree, I ordered the stuffed pork chop. I felt that even though there was sauce, it still tasted a little dry in my mouth. So to counteract I had to vigorously add sauce to my pork chop. Half way in was when I noticed stuffing because I tasted mushrooms and I was wondering where the hell is this from?! I thought it was a nice surprise. My mother ordered the fish of the day which I thought was tasty. What made it was the lemon taste with the fish because of the olives as well as lemons themselves. My father ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the Red Snapper. I thought it was very tasty. My brother thought it was very tender, mixed with the tomatoes it went well at the same time it kept with the Italian flavor. I and also my family enjoyed the hint of garlic on the fish. My brother ordered the ""Osso Bucco"" which is veal. I thought it was delicious. The flavors of the veal as well as the sauce mixed really well. However, the risotto that came with it was mixed with cheese and we agreed that it wasn't cooked all the way through. Lastly for dessert, I had the tiramisu and my mother had the vanilla custard. I felt as mine was tasty, but if I had to choose the dessert I think I would have gone with the custard. Overall, Luce did a wonderful job and it's a wonderful placed to eat for those special occasions. The interior is a little small, but that could mean the experience could feel a little more intimate.",positive
"Oowee. This is some seriously great Italian. If you like your meals to take time, then this place is five stars. The food is five stars. But the slooooow service drops it a notch. Our server didn't have an extensive knowledge of the beer list. This probably shows my naivete with regard to what you're supposed to order at a restaurant like Luce, but still, a good server knows EVERYTHING, or at least acts like it. Thus, Peroni. [sigh] My appetizer was the veal cutlets, just little thin slices of tender baby calf with a dallop of sauce and capers. I'm going to spend a few more months in Purgatory for eating veal, but MAN, it will be worth it! My main course was the cheese rolled in pork, the Fraciti I believe it was called (I can't seem to pull up the menu online) with gnocchi. Seriously great stuff. I ended with the custard and berries, which was okay. I wouldn't send it away, but perhaps I was expecting something more after the faaaaaantastic appetizer and entree. Whew. Again, the only drawback was the 2.5 hour meal. An entire tenth of my day was spent at this restaurant. In some sense it was worth it, just be prepared. Go GO GO!",positive
We went here as a business dinner of 5 folks. I found this restaurant totally amazing! The staff was extra special helpful and the food choices were good for everyone. I would highly recommend to come here for business or pleasure!,positive
"We searched for availability late on a Saturday afternoon for reservations prime time Saturday night and settled on Dolce. Great reviews on food and service. We ended up loving it...mostly. The seafood linguine dish was out of this world -- loaded with shrimp, scallops, lobster, mussels, calamari, clams, excellent sauce and pasta. Salads were very good. Buttera was excellent with rally good italian sausage and crisp pancetta. The only disappointing dish was the piccata which was so overwhelmingly lemon flavored that both te meat and the spinach were hard to taste. Semi freddo was to die for. Service was slower than anticipated based on other reviews. I would call it average. Overall a very good meal and evening.",positive
We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food,positive
"Man I had really high hopes for Luce. I don't know maybe I had my expectations set to high or maybe it was just another restaurant week mishap. Well here is the good the service was great - the atmosphere was great - the dessert (tirimisu) pretty delicious, but everything else just fell short. I ordered a dirty martini (received a straight-up martini with a twist of lemon) the boyfriend ordered a long island iced tea (we all tried to figure out what kind of drink they actually made him tasted like bourbon) but I could live with the drink mishap I'm happy I had my vodka. Now for the food... I started with the panzanella salad there wasn't much taste in the dish it was under seasoned just plain. I ordered the manicotti for my dinner - I wish I would have known before I took a bite how hot this dish was I could barely feel my tongue after that. The manicotti was ok but not memorable. The dish that not only looked really disappointing but as I was told by my guests I brought along with me it was tasteless too. I'm not going to lie their chicken dishes looked like a lean cuisine you know those teeny tiny chicken breasts that come in lean cuisine meals well folks that is exactly what they got. Although that was a sad dish the pork chop my boyfriend ordered was delicious and the veal shank was quite tasty as well. Will I be back ...hmm not sure yet.",negative
"Very nice upscale resturant with great location. Went out with girlfriend of 6 years on new years eve and although we had to wait intially, we were offered free champagne by the bartender (great customer service), shortly after seating, offered three course option (antipasta, entree and dessert) discluding any alochol purchases. I had the Filet which was cooked perfectly, Luce also has a great wine selection in its cellar, you can actually see the quality of wines. Also, the Maitre'D was continously checking on us and making sure the night was enjoyable. Overall a great experience and will reuturn for special occasions.",positive
"PHENOMENAL!!! My wife and I came here for dinner on Saturday night for combo anniversary/birthday dinner. I have the opportunity to eat out alot due to my work schedule including in NY and DC quite a bit and this place was top notch. I was a little nervous that it was going to be too quiet and old folks after some of the reviews here but I thought that atmosphere was a nice mix between lively and romantic. The maitre'd was extremely cordial and checked on us several times. They were out of the initial wine we ordered so they gave us a better wine for the same price. Nice touch and start! Then the food - they have this amazing white bean/olive oil dip for the bread....I know...doesn't sound that good but so tasty - i even tried to replicate it at home the following night. We had the grilled octopus, branzino with artichokes and thinly sliced potato, and veal ravioli. All were superb. Then we were planning on going to Crave Desert Lounge nearby but they said the wanted to bring some sweets over....they brought two whole deserts and the semi-freddo with the honey was too die for. Top notch. Highly recommended.",positive
"Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-) I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less. The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy! Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!",positive
"We came in last night for a friends birthday and they went out of they're way to make it even more special, not only was the food great but they sent out a champagne toast to start and also a birthday dessert!! We started off with the Beef Carpaccio that was so delicious it's now one of my top three in Charlotte!! We also had a Cheese and Meat plate with some Olives also very good the olives were really tasty!! For my Entree I had the Rack of Lamb that was served with Artichokes and Fingerling Potatoes it was DELISH!! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned great!! I believe everyone enjoyed they're Entrees also, but I was more concerned with my own to care!! The service was great and the manager checked in to see how everything was. We really had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves!! I will be back soon!!",positive
We went there for restaurant week. The place is very cozy. Drinks are at least $8 a pop. The hostess was really accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately the food was far from impressive. They brought bread and bean which is yummy but there were not enough for eight of us. I'm not sure why you would bring 5 slices of bread on a table of 8 (we must look like those Atkins diet people). The crab/salmon patty was overcook. The risotto was good. The dinner (some kind of fish) was salty. To make matter worse... I found a long blond hair in my fish. The waiter comp my meal out. The manager never come out and talk to us (I think he's too busy tasting the wines). In conclusion... yea... we're not coming back.,negative
"Nice, upscale italian restaurant. Beautiful decor, great service and great food. The wait staff is very educated and can help you with selections, wine pairings and anything you need. The food is wonderful. Luce is not inexpensive but is well worth every cent. Located at the base of the Hearst tower so parking there is easy and it's a central uptown location. Worth a visit if you're looking for upscale dining with authentic italian dishes.",positive
OMG these meatballs will make you cry they are so good!! We didn't even order the entree yet and it is sooo delicious! I took my family here for my daughter's 21 bday dinner and from the cocktails to the dessert and coffee everything is delicious! Beautiful atmosphere if you want to dress up or for a casual dinner.. Plenty of style and ambiance. Highly recommended!,positive
The atmosphere and service were really great! It's a very romantic setting with low music that sets a great dining experience. The prices weren't bad either. The menu offered a good amount of options. We had bruschetta as an appetizer and it was very yummy! Unfortunately the entrees were not very good. They were a little bland and my bf's salmon wasn't cooked very well. Kind of a let down since the beginning of the meal started so great.,negative
"In a world where Rex Marvin was one run over by two guys dressed as Martha Steward driving a dump truck at a high rate of speed...very little surprises Rex. Rex has endured ""surprises"" that would kill a man. Rex was surprised when Kathy Bates jumped out his birthday cake wearing nothing but frosting and nipple clamps. Rex was surprised when he was sold into slavery and forced to pick coffee beans in Ethiopia...not because of the slavery, but because the food was much better than he had anticipated. Rex was surprised when he was covered in blood holding a human head high on gas fumes and giddiness from a Paula Poundstone concert...and the police want to lock HIM up. (Misunderstanding of course, anyone in a Paula Poundstone show is there to kill themselves quickly or slowly...the gentleman next Rex picked quickly. Rex still considers a wise and wonderful man. Why was Rex there...to develop mental toughness. Sit through 20 minutes without killing yourself, and torture you will surely endure at the hands of 13 year olds with machete's forcing you to pick coffee beans faster will seem like a joke. Rex has handled these surprises and many others with dignity and class. The one surprise that Rex cannot abide...cannot fathom...cannot think of any other adjectives... is how Lucio Ristorante isn't held up to the world as the shining beacon of Italian food in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is filled with more bad Italian food than a Danish Italian Food Expo Rex once attended in Peoria, Illinois. Those damn Danes will get theirs! Friggin' fish salters! They stole my beloved Italian food and then they stole my less than beloved companion, Cyclops Cindy. Old one eye...sweet girl...giving girl...the things she would let you do to that eye should be illegal...Rex thinks they might be...but nothing is too savage and vulgar for a Dane who cooks Italian food in Peoria...trust Rex on that! Rex has spent many years in institutions on the East Coast...and Rex KNOWS great Italian food. Rex know the wonderful experience those beautiful swarthy bastards can create. Rex also knows the pain of a Dane in a fake mustache...and all things in between. Here in Las Vegas there is as many good Italian places to eat as there hookers without kids...NOT MANY! Lucio's is a find. A city treasure. First...the appetizers. The finest fried Calamari this side of the Atlantic ocean. Brilliantly prepared, perfectly battered and served with a tasty marinara sauce. The Antipasto is also wonderful and the spicy shrimp (Gamberi Fra Diavlo) is simply wonderful. Perfectly seasoned, not too hot and excellent shrimp. The César salad is a triumph of fine ingredients and the way not to over dress greens. The signature salart is good, but Rex can't stand Gorgonzola, so he isn't a fair judge. Second, the main course...so much to say. So little time. The Risotto, their pride and joy, is TRULY the best in the city. It is impeccably done...slight bite, soft but not too soft...velvety and creamy...it is just wonderful. Treat yourself...Rex does...to the Truffle or the Scampi. The Truffle is Rex's favorite. The pasta dishes are all well executed, well seasoned and very generous portions...much like Rex. The Spicy Shrimp (Penne Scampi Fra Diavlo) and the Spaghetti with meatballs (spaghetti con polpettine) are real standouts. The eggplant parmesan (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana). The Pollo Sorrentina is a great dish, chicken with prociutto and mushrooms...delicious. One problem happens at desert. The Tiramisu is severly lacking that great espresso bite...almost none to be found anywhere. The Pastiera Napolentana is so well done Rex barely minded the problem with the Tiramisu. The Cannoli's are also wonderful and very authentic. Special mention to the wait staff. Great servers. Very knowledgeable about the food. They want to make your experience a good one. I couldn't be more thrilled with the staff. Rex has never had a bad plate, let alone a bad meal and he has eaten there 20 times. They often have specially on Groupon or other sites, and the 20 bucks for 40 bucks of food might be one of the best deals Rex has ever had. Get on their email list too! Great deals. In this town of miscreants, low life's, and scumbags...you know...my people...all promising great Italian food...most of the liars or fools...Lucios stands head and shoulders above the rest. Extremely reasonably priced, well cared for dishes by attentive cooks and extremely friendly wait staff...you can't do better in any food genre. Much like an elderly Katherine Hepburn said to a young Rex Marvin ""you almost broke my hip."" Not sure how that fits, Rex just likes to brag.",positive
"I went here for dinner. For the food it was very good. Had the appetizer Calamari Alla Luciana. Very delicious, calamari was not overcooked and the tomato sauce had a little kick to it. For me, I would've liked this over some pasta but instead sopped that sucker up with the bread. Oh, and the bread, crusty on the outside, soft and light on the inside. My friend found it so delicious he wanted to buy a couple of loaves to take home. They didn't have enough but told us who the supplier was. We went straight to the bakery after dinner to purchase the bread. Again, had the Moretti for beverage, very good lager For the main courses, I tried a special, red wine marinara sauce with sausage tossed with spaghetti. It was OK, the sausage tasted good but there was too much marinara sauce that I found it overpowering. Now, on to the Wild Mushroom Risotto. It was delicious, it was fairly loose good texture, and nice mushroom flavor. I needed to try it to see if i was making risotto correctly. Obviously not, oh well, at least I have a very good reference point. I'm giving this place 5 stars but with some reservation. The bathroom, arrgh. Wasn't clean and the toilet was not working. Other than that, the dining area was cozy, food was very good, service was excellent.",positive
"It is only a hail mary throw away from where I am currently holing up, that is always a plus as gas prices are expected to go back up with more recent Mid East unrests. The 65+ crowd seems to really dig it, and I don't think they even have an AARP discount. However, they do seem to have a lot of Groupon and Restaurant dot com promos. Anyway, Groupon Now was how I ended up here for dinner. It was a nice little Italian restaurant tucked away in a strip mall, practically sandwiched between Subway and Outback. And I thought I give them a try. The place was not crowded on a Friday night, so there was no wait. Great for me, probably not so much for the restaurant. After studying the menu, I ordered their Calamari Fritti, a benchmark test I have for Italian restaurants. The portions were larger than I had expected, and it was better than okay. But not the best I have had in LV. I also ordered the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (another tried and true benchmark test), which is thin flat pasta, served with mussels, clams, shrimps, and really tiny scallops in a tomato sauce with crushed red peppers, garlic and wine. It was decent, and not burn your mouth spicy, but with enough heat to make my nose run all night. Since I have an above average appetite, I also tried their Pollo Sorrentina (breast of chicken sauteed with shallots, chicken stock, white wine and topped with prosciutto, fontina cheese and mushrooms. This was another nice entree, that is pleasant but not spectacular. Tiramisu was how I concluded this meal and unintentionally shut down the restaurant for the night. It was again just okay. But overall it was a pleasant dining experience, and I can see why it was popular with the more mature crowd. Ambiance: 4/5 Music playing softly in the background, and the dining room was softly illuminated. Food: 3.5 No complaints. Generous portions on some items. Service: 4/5 Nice waiter, didn't try to oversell, since he was surprised that I even wanted to order a second entree and tried to discourage me from doing so. Location: Not really for out of town tourists staying on the Strip, but a local dining spot on the West side. Parking: 5/5 Plentiful. Giving it 3 stars, as it is better than 3 but not close enough to 4 to get the bump in my personal rating.",negative
"I LOVE Lucio!! This is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!! There's not many great Italian restaurants in Vegas, so my boyfriend and I end up eating here at least once a month!! It's in a business park/strip mall type of thing but don't let the location fool you!! When you walk in, the ambiance is both modern and cozy. It's not super fancy, but it's nice. You get complimentary bread basket with some chimichurri. It's ok. I'm not crazy about it, which works bc I always need to save room for the rest of the meal!! We always get the same appetizers - The bruschetta and the calamari!! Both are delicious!! I always add a tiny bit of balsamic to the bruschetta then it's perfect. The calamari is absolutely delicious!! It's hard for us to ever try anything else because it's just so good!! For my entree, I usually try to order something from the specials but when I can't decide on one, I usually resort to the Pollo Sorrentina, which is on their permanent menu. OMG - it is AMAZING!! It is a sauteed chicken breast in a white wine sauce, topped with prosciutto, fontina cheese, and mushrooms. It comes with a small portion of steamed veggies and roasted potatoes. For $16, it is a GREAT meal! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I never have room for dessert since I always leave here beyond stuffed, but my boyfriend always manages to make room for the tiramisu, which he claims is the best he's ever had in the 20+ years of eating tiramisu!! so I guess it must be good :) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a great italian dinner!!",positive
Fabulous. We eat there a few times a week. Never disappointed. The best meatballs and Veal Parmesano. I am telling everyone about it.,positive
"Small cozy intimate location with bunch of regulars. The food is decent but I would have a hard time paying full price without the $50 Restaurant.com coupon. It's pretty standard Italian IMO, nothing special and nothing i havent seen anywhere else. The bruschetta was very tasty and came with 3 big pieces. The baguette was nice and crisp and the tomatoes was well seasoned. The Cozze e vongole, clams and mussels in in a white wine lemon sauce was a rip off IMO. The sauce was tasty but just doesn't seem like you get much. We really enjoyed the free bread and chimichurri sauce. Very tasty soaking up the bread from the Clam/Mussel white wine lemon sauce and chimichurri. They claim to have the best risotto in town and the mushroom was pretty good - had good texture but I felt it could have a little more flavor to it. We also ordered the breaded veal chop which was topped with arugula and truffle oil. Good service and food but for the money, I would prefer to have something more unique. This is definietly more safe and standard Italian American food IMO. 3 stars maybe a little harsh - probably between 3 and 4. They definitely get their share of regulars though.",negative
"My Wife loves Italian food!!! I, in the other hand not so much until I tasted their sauce on a small bowl of side dish spaghetti along with the main eggplant dish I ordered. I kept making ""mmm....mmmm....mmmm"" yummy noises and batted my eye lashes to my Wife as I devoured the side dish. I pause and try to find the unique flavors in the sauce and only could pronounce ""artichoke...fish?!"" But later, woke up from the high and gave an educated guess: Anchovies! I would not try anchovies on my pizzas...these critters need to be invisible like escargots. Ironic! I in my 37 years finally found an Italian place that almost over tops Filipino, Thai, Indian, KoMex, Kogi BBQ, etc.... Oh, I don't mind the wait much because it's a 5 star.......",positive
"I had hoped for more. The service was OK. Not great. The food was also OK, not great. This got a 28 Zagat rating and I have no idea how. I would try it one more time and my wife would not. So we are not going back. Even the bread was bad. Blah.",negative
"The guy at the dog bakery I go recommended your restaurant and so glad he did. Great food, great prices, great service. Best Italian food in town.",positive
"We were give a gift certificate for this restaurant, and thought we would go for Valentines day. I made reservations a week before at the Sahara location, and called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, ""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you."" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute? About 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, "" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed."" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, ""Sorry, we're too busy."" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same. A week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use. After we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?) The salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead. For the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci. This was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever. I'm glad I had a gift certificate, because I most certainly would not have paid for this experience.",negative
"We came here because of all the great reviews on YELP, it was an early dinner and we were in the neighborhood. We were one of only two tables in the restaurant when we arrived. The door has a Zagat rating on it when we entered, so that made me feel confident we would be getting a great meal- a 28 by Zagat rating is no joke. We sat down to a cute table, and were greeted by a Italian waiter, we could hear Italian being spoken in the kitchen, so my mind was put at ease- thinking if they are Italian they may know how to cook good Italian food. The waiter took our order, and took his time getting us water. He gave me an attitude when I asked regarding if there were anchovies on the Ceasar Salad- which BTW should always have anchovies in the dressing and a chilled plate- but I give most places slack- especially since Caesar Salad is a Mexican dish- NOT Italian. He said he would add the anchovies to the dish- He said I should have just asked for them instead of asking if there were anchovies in the Ceasar salad. The Ceasar salad came with the anchovies (4) placed on top- room temp plate. It was OK, but not amazing. The bread they put on the table was dry, and not very appealing. At this point my husband and I are both asking ourselves how this joint got a 28 ZAGAT rating? and such good YELP reviews? I ordered the gnocchi, which the waiter assured me was home made and amazing. It arrived on a flat plate, white, no decor on the plate, the cheesy sauce was white, the gnocchi was white, the plate was white, it was not appealing to look at- nor was it flavorful. It tasted like what it looked like. Thankfully a waitress came by and offered some Parmesan cheese- with that and added salt made this bland sorry dish edible. My husband ordered a shrimp dish, which was late at arriving to the table as the waiter had ordered him calamari by accident, and then he got his eggplant entrée. Both were OK but not Amazing. By the time our dinner had arrived the waitress came over to explain that there were free Hors d'uvres available- How come our waiter failed to mention these I don't know- maybe trying to get a bigger bill? My husband went over and got some- deep fried artichoke and bruschetta. The artichoke was meh, and the bruschetta was at least tasty but soggy( since it was sitting out for a while I guess). Overall disappointing- would not go back. I am guessing this is a local joint where there is just a desert surrounding it, and no where else to eat nearby. The owners are cordial enough, but really not a reason to go back. The only reason I would go back is that it is NOT a chain and it is a locally owned business, but not for the food.",negative
I found my new favorite Italian spot! After telling a friend I can never find good italian food she suggested Lucios. I am glad she did. When the cooks making the food are italian you know its going to be good. Try anything on the menu its all amazing!,positive
"Everything you want in a mid-priced, authentic cucina.... More than just a red sauce joint, excellent menu and wine list. Service was warm and attentive... We'll be back!",positive
Excellent food! My wife and I came here last night and were impressed with quality of the food. I ordered their homemade cavatelli with sausage and peas and my wife ordered the risotto. You can tell the cavatelli pasta was authentically made in house and the risotto is really one of the best in town. This restaurant is a hidden gem and we will definitely be back!,positive
"Oh. My. God. Hands down the best dinner I had in Vegas. Possibly the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy, definitely the best since leaving Jersey. It's a couple miles off the strip, but soooooooooooo worth the trip. The bruschetta was amazing, the fettuccine bolognase was awesome and the lobster risotto was to. die. for. I cannot talk this place up enough. Go here!!",positive
"Dropped in to the new location on Flamingo because Nora's was closed on Sunday- our lucky find! They claim to have the best Risotto in LV- it being a slow night, our waiter Franco informed us it would have to be made from scratch and take a little longer (i.e. 18 minutes) than we might have expected. Actually, after our salad courses were complete, the entrees came along without delay so no issue there. My wife and I had the house salad Insalata Ortolana- very tasty! Our friends ordered the Insalata Caprese which was just okay (In fairness, it is hard to find an outstanding caprese these days). The risotto was outstanding- perfectly cooked! Our friends ordered the Ravioli d'Aragosta and Pollo Sorrentina and were happy with their meal as well. Of course my wife had to have the Tiramasu. Previous posters have raved about this dish and the praise is well deserved. I wasn't feeling to well so I didn't try the Cannoli but maybe next time... A little more pricey and formal than Nora's but just as good. Well worth the drive from the Strip & a great find for out-of-towners who would like to get a flavor of local Las Vegas.",positive
"Last night, I celebrated the birthday of a good friend at Lucio Ristorante at her suggestion. I had not heard of it and was willing to try. I can tend to be a little ""meh"" about Italian cuisine, but it was her birthday, so.... Driving on Sahara, I wasn't sure where it was, but it was nestled in a shopping area adjacent to an Outback Steakhouse. As I walked in, the lights were dimmed, the decor contemporary, yet warm and inviting, and the staff was welcoming. After sitting down and making my wine choice, everything told me that this place is a hidden gem. I liked that it was patronized by people that seemed to know what they had found, and it was quiet enough to have an intimate conversation. While perusing the menu, I asked a few questions and was told that the chef is authentically Italian. Good sign....My friend and I split a Ceasar salad, which was fresh and delicious. The dressing had that slight peppery tang that sets my taste buds a-dance :) Going traditional, she ordered the lasagna which was a mighty portion with layers upon layers of noodles, cheese and meat sauce which looked both hearty and delicate at the same time. I decided upon the Frutti de Mar.... a generous base of linguine tossed with a slightly spicy, garlicky red sauce acting as a cushion for shrimp, scallops and mussels. It really was wonderful. For dessert, we went all out. Birthday, ya know.... We chose the Tiramisu, which was decadent, light and melted on the tongue, and a chocolate tartuffo al ciccolato, a tempting ball of lightly frozen chocolate mousse surrounding a center of vanilla and amaretto ice cream, then dusted with cocoa powder. The sensation of the dry powder along with the creamy, cold chocolate was phenomenal. Mmmmm. The prices on this menu would fall in the high-medium range (though they are often featured on restaurant.com, so you can make it cheaper that way). I found the selections to be ample enough to give a thorough meander through authentic Italian fare, but not so much that you are overwhelmed by the menu. The staff also have an aire of familiarity and friendliness that makes me think that if you wanted something that you didn't see listed, they might just whip it up for you. I would definitely visit this little place again. A perfect place to impress a date or go with a girlfriend to catch up. I love finds like this one. Check it out, and Buon Appetito !!",positive
"We go to Lucio's frequently after being referred by several friends. The atmosphere is very nice, prices reasonable and the waiters are great - very friendly and efficient. The menu is fairly extensive and we have tried (by sharing) most of the menu. We have never had a bed meal. In fact, this has become our ""go to"" place whenever we can't decide where to eat. Our kids love it, as do the friend we have brought in. We're very picky about our Italian food - and we love Lucio's. Best Italian in Vegas!!",positive
"Excellent, authentic Italian Restaurant. We had a ""Special"" dinner there for a large group (12) and they did a wonderful job for us. Ordered from the menu and each course was delivered at the same time to each person. We found that to be quite a feat. Nice selection of wines, really good food with attentive service at reasonable prices. We'll definitely go back.",positive
"Exceptionally good food in an unremarkable location with excellent service and moderate prices. This is classic Italian dining in a calm, relaxed, almost romantic atmosphere. Try their Arancini (deep fried risotto balls stuffed with Mozzarella cheese) for an appetizer. Their Fillet of Sole, Lamb and Risotto are all excellent. They are located out on the West side of town not too far from the newer Red Rock Casino. We stumbled upon this by accident last year and we like it enough that go here every time we pass through Las Vegas! It is worth the drive from downtown. Jim",positive
Lucio is excellent Italian food and to me has the best Tiramisu in Las Vegas. The food I would give 4.5 stars. It all depends on your preference but they are very accommodating to make you whatever you would like. I love family run places and Lucio is a wonderful place to eat. They have great lunch specials and to go if you are not in the mood to dine in. They have a nice wine selection to accompany your dinner. The tortellini is great. I have them make it with a marinara or arrabiatta sauce which fits my palate better. The service has been very good every time I have been and I have been quite a few times since discovering Lucio. One of the top 5 Italian restaurants in Vegas. I always enjoy coming to Lucio.,positive
"My friend recommended this place, and it was a great choice! It took us 30 min to find it but boy, it was worth it! I loved everything about this small restaurant and consider it to be the best Italian restaurant in Vegas. Definitely coming back! It is a small family owned Italian place with a great decour and excellent food. We got to meet the owner Lucio who was very friendly and the server (I forgot his name but he was from Romania and later we found out that he and his wife are the only one who serve there) was very knowledgeable with the wine and food. Thank you for all recommendations. Definitely 5 stars for the service! When it comes to the decour, it is very tasty. I loved the colors. And as an opposite to the previous reviewer, I found the chairs very cushy and comfortable. The whole place is very romantic and great for a date. When it comes to food, my friend ordered filet mignon and I had sole (recommended by the server). It is not common to find steak in an Italian restaurant, and according to my friend who is a food snob, it was the best steak that he ever had. My sole was great too. Both dishes had some sauces on them which made it even more tasty. We also had ministrone soup and salad, which both were pretty good. To top that we had fruit sorbet in the white chocolate. Yum! Oh and the lighting is great. Not too bright and not too dark. The music is all Italian: not too loud and not too quiet. Apparantly they have live jazz on the weekends and I cannot wait to check that out! Highly recommended.",positive
"We went here with a big group, and i wasn't very impressed. The food was good, but not great - probably about 2-3 stars. My mom ordered a caesar salad with light dressing, and it came out with quite heavy dressing. Not too big of a deal.... but she sent it back and the waiter apologized and said he'd bring another. He did, but it was just as sopping in dressing. 3rd try? not so much. very disappointing. I had the special of the evening, canneloni di carne, which was OK, but nothing worth writing home about (and yet, ironically enough here I am writing about it...). The service was pretty good though, and we had an EXCELLENT mango sorbet covered in a white chocolate shell. Definitely the highlight. conclusion: not bad for a reasonably priced dinner with the family or something, but I wouldn't bring a date here...",negative
"We came here for lunch. The place is cutely decorated though a bit faded around the edges. And the seats are hard on the tush! Three of us all got the same salad so it wasn't a wide sampling of food. But what we got was good, nicely dressed, with a generous portion of chicken. The waitress seemed a little flighty. She originally brought out soup, realized her mistake, mumbled and walked away. Meanwhile due to that mistake, from the time we ordered until the time we got our food took awhile. It would have been better if she had explained. Or maybe even comped us the soup. But the menu was inviting enough that I'd go try it a second time.",negative
"I went here previously with my wife and it was manageable, and we enjoyed it for the most part. We decided to go back with her children hoping for the same experience. To are disappointment it was anything but that. My wife ordered fried onions on her Burger but never received it, so we then asked for it and the lady there gave us an attitude. We didn't think it was a big deal to ask for something that we already initially asked for and never received. And even after all of that we got charged extra for the fried onions that we had already paid for. As for my children, they enjoyed their burgers and I am pleased about that. Mooyah please just make sure that your employees have kindness in their heart, because customer service plays a big role in whether someone comes back or not. Thank you",negative
Always a treat going to Mooyah. Never heard of it until it opened and tried it and just love the burgers. The fries are always hot and done perfect for me. I love the Chocolate Shake for a treat once in a while. Staff is nice. I like the atmosphere of the place. Sometimes the owner comes out and checks on the customers and talk to them.,positive
"So many options to appease even the pickiest eater, that would be me :) GLUTEN FREE, no problem, there is a well built lettuce bun for any burger item, or gluten free buns! Do you realize how happy this made me feel, it is so hard to find burger spots that offer gluten free buns. What we ordered: -Farmers burger: Vegan, black bean burger on a lettuce wrap with a side of sweet potato fries -A1 Burger- name speaks for itself -Kids Grilled cheese with apple sauce ( my 2year old killed this) What we liked: EVERYTHING, from the fast and friendly service, the size of each burger and side, the taste, and the prices. This is my new favorite spot for burgers, non-gmo potato buns for each burger or you can also do wheat ... like I said plenty of options. I wasn't able to try any of the other menu items but I did see chili chees fries, and milk shakes. Mooyah definitely exceeded my expectations, so long five guys... and don't forget to ring the bell before you leave If you received good service, we sure did .",positive
Every time me and my family come here it's a great experience the food is really good quality the bread is homemade I always customize my burger the sweet potato fries are always fresh everything here is really really good,positive
"I've been a ""Five Guys"" fan forever but this place blows it out of the water. The burgers are juicier, the fries are amazing (especially the sweet potato fries) and the shakes are delicious. There are so many more options than you can find at Five Guys as well. Our first visit, I had the ""Crandidate"" (a Turkey burger especially for this election year) and was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. My son got a hot dog and, not only is the dog itself yummy, the bun is fresh and delicious. On our next visit I got a burger (the Well D'Onion to be exact) and was absolutely blown away. Seriously, if you live close enough to have the decision in where you go for your burgers out, check out Mooyah. I'm hooked!",positive
"While the food and service are all excellent, Mooyah doesn't really do or have anything that separates it from places like Five Guys. The menu options, the way the food is prepared, the prices...I really felt like I was in a Five Guys location when I was eating at Mooyah Again, the food is great and I would certainly recommend Mooyah, but they really should do something to differentiate themselves. Maybe offer some unique burger toppings, unique sides, etc.",negative
Burger was good as were the fries. Portion size is more than I usually eat in one sitting. The ice cream / milkshakes are the reason to go. Get in there and enjoy. Save room for dessert....,negative
"Excellent burgers with all the toppings you want (included in one price)! The sweet potato fries are good and I love the option for the lettuce cap ""bun."" It's a little expensive for a burger and fries (and especially if you add a shake), but once you start eating, you forgot that you just paid $10 for a burger and fries. The beef is juicy and delicious. My fav is a burger with sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, and tomato with a lettuce bun. My kids like the chicken fingers, grilled cheese, and the kid's burger.",positive
"Once was enough for this Five Guys knockoff. The order was simple: burger and fries. The fries were ok, but not very hot. The burger was very over cooked, hard and dried out. When I complained to the manager she said, ""We cook them well done just like Five Guys."" She refused to cook a burger any less done than what I was served. I left after two bites and won't return.",negative
"The food here is pretty good plus it's not expensive if your on a budget. Only problem that happens all the time is bad customer service. Every time I eat there the same employee at the register seems to be so rude. Just watch out! Good grub, bad service..",negative
"Where's the beef?! I ordered a double burger and the wife had a regular Mooyah. Imagine my surprise when the food came out and the wife's single patty on her burger was larger than my two patties combined! The reason people order a double is because they want more than a single! Maybe it was an off day, but the cook should have noticed the comparison as he was preparing our order. A 1 star experience, but gave an extra star since the burger did taste good...",negative
"What a surprise to fund this place in the middle of a completely yuppie uptown area. Wait..you aren't overcharging for burger and fries? Wait...you bring it to the table and are actually nice about it? OK, great! These burgers were freshly ground perfectly cooked awesomeness. Juicy, stacked full of flavor and lots of options Their fresh fries were pretty rockin as well!! If you like good burgers and at a reasonable price...PLEASE find this place! You will NOT regret it!!",positive
"Owner has a bad attitude .. He is a very rude person,, Never supporting his business again !! And I think he under pays his employees!!!!!!!",negative
Second visit tonight and we are sad to say not going to return. The prices are high for what you get. They have both times served incorrect items causing one person to sit waiting for food. My children love the shakes so maybe for desert or a treat.,negative
I simply love this place. My daughters and I went there after my youngest spotted it while shopping. Let me start with the meat... It's fresh ground beef and hand shaped on the grill. The quality is superb let's move on too the bread is freshly baked. I love the mooyah sauce and sweet potato fries were the best. I go there after time I want a great burger. Its better then bang bang....,positive
"3 times and all have been Great, I can not wait to try the IceBurger. The Kids Hot Dogs are very large, to large much for my 6 year old but just right for my 11 year. Shakes are also very good and very thick.",positive
I just ate the best burger I've had in recent memory. The husband got a 'MOOYAH' style burger and I got a cheeseburger. My plate was clean within 5 minutes and I wasn't even that hungry... It was THAT good. Hubby said his burger reminded him of a gourmet In and Out burger... He lived in CA for several years and tells me that's a very big compliment. We will absolutely be back!,positive
"Service was friendly, BUT I classify this as a modified fast food restaurant it should not have taken 20 minutes for a burger, fries and drink. Then lets talk about the salt burger. I ordered the Mooyah burger done the Mooyah way which means sauce, tomato, lettuce, pickle, grilled onion and American cheese on a whole wheat bun. My first bite was with everything and it seemed salty so I scrapped off the extras and took off the bread and just tried the burger, turns out it was the burger itself that was overly salty, in fact so salty there was no other taste coming through. Definitely NOT going back.",negative
Went there for lunch. For 12 noon it was too empty. It's a shame because lunch was good. I guess no one knows about the place. We just happened to notice the place while visiting another store.,positive
"Tried this place tonight and was nicely surprised. The burgers are really tasty with a nice burger to bun ratio and just the right quantity of toppings. Fries were hot and fresh and tasted hand cut. Standout chocolate shake, not to much chocolate and very smooth and creamy. We will be back!",positive
"I have to give these guys just an eh.... It was not bad but it was nothing special either. I came in at about 11:45 and just like everyone has said it was empty. A couple of other guests came in while I ate but 3 tables was the max number of guests. I ordered the Mooyah with cheese (and extra seasoning thanks to other reviews) with Cheddar, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and BBQ sauce. The bun is way too small for the burger. The toppings were kinda tossed under the patty, some here and some there. I actually took it apart to spread the toppings out before I ate it. The flavor was....well...BBQ sauce. The little drizzle was the only flavor to the whole thing (even with ""extra seasoning""). The fries were actually really good . They are hand cut and made in-house . This is a huge pluse. They were seasoned well and we're not too limp or overly crisp. I also order a strawberry milkshake . I think they forgot the milk part. It is hand-spun which is nice but without the milk I just got a cup of ice cream with strawberry sauce . Everyone working seemed bored but I guess that is to be expected when you have almost no guests. Overall not horrible but just a mid-range burger place. There are better options for the prices.",negative
"Stopped in for a late lunch this evening and was highly underwhelmed. A dad with 2 children was waiting off to the side while 3 employees were consulting a wall chart. Things didn't seem to be going well for them, as no one acknowledged them whatsoever while I stood there. I went to the restroom, and when I returned, they were still standing there and decided to leave. I was then greater by a man and pointed towards the family now leaving. Another staff member chased them down. I ordered a burger with a few toppings, and an order of sweet potato fries. The bun to burger ration was terrible, and the bun was so greasy that I was unable to finish my burger. The toppings had been stuffed on the underside of the burger, and we're pretty meager....3 pickle ends, half a strip of bacon, and the blue cheese was barely heated. The sweet potatoes fries were redeeming until the 3 men working began to order the lone female worker around much like Cinderella while they all dissapeared",negative
"The best hamburgers ever and the buns were excellent. I had the sweet potato fries and my husband had the regular fries. Both were were so good but my husband ate some of my fries and I have never seen him eat sweet potatoes. The shakes were awesome . I also liked the fact that my food was served on a tray, not in a bag. Mooyah is now my favorite place to get really good, really fresh food, prepared just the way I like it.",positive
"Ew, man! My burger tasted like a hot dog, straight up. Nothing like a beef patty. It was really disgusting and I'm very disappointed. Wasted $12. My soda was good though...The jalapeños are super delicious, but then the fries tasted like they were fried in old ass oil, soo...",negative
"We were doing some shopping in Matthews and stumbled upon Mooyah when we were looking for something small to eat. I was pleased to see that Mooyah let you pick whatever kind of burger you wanted (be it beef, turkey, veggie, or even hot dog) and then pile whatever you wanted onto it without nickel-and-diming you for every item. Forget Burger King, this is truly ""Have it your way."" I opted for something spicy, so I picked the turkey burger with Buffalo sauce, chunky blue cheese, jalapenos, and crispy onions. Instead of a bun, I tried the lettuce wrap version. What I got was something amazing. The burger was very flavorful, and all of my selected toppings complemented one another. The crispy onions gave it some crunch. My lettuce ""wrap"" was several layers of iceberg lettuce on either side of the burger, forming its own ""bun."" Everything about it was perfect. Since we were eating ""light,"" we didn't try any sides, like the French fries, but they looked awesome from what we saw on other tables. They looked fresh cut with the skins on. It was such a nice day that nobody was eating inside the restaurant (although they have a good size dining room). Everyone was enjoying eating outdoors, which they have plenty of seating for. We'll definitely go back when we're shopping in that area. The prices and food were both great. I'm not going to lie, though. I'm probably going to get the exact same thing because it was such a delicious combination.",positive
"This place is amazing!!! The burgers are fresh made-to-order, and you have an ingredient list of at least 15 add one! Fries are perfect, not mushy or over salted. The also provide veggie burger options, and a variety of shakes. The Mooyah burger is a must try!!!",positive
"When a restaurant specializes in two things only - burgers & fries, you would think they would excel. In my opinion, this is not the case. The burger had no flavor and the fries were greasy & limp. Plus this new restaurant is very, very expensive for what you get. The girl at the cash register added 70 cents to my bill for cheese when I didn't even order cheese. The only thing positive was the customer service. I won't be going back.",negative
"First of all I love burgers! My wife went with a friend yesterday and loved it so much she got me to come today! I loved it! The burgers are amazing, the sweet potato fries are delicious, and the Oreo shake is mind blowing... Lastly. The staff. Oh my gosh the staff! Warm, helpful, friendly, go the extra mile for you! The service is unbelievable! I look forward to my next visit:)",positive
Seriously love this place. I came here 2 days in a row! The service is excellent- everyone is friendly and cares about how you are enjoying your experience/meal. The burger was delicious! They have a wheat bun that is so good. I also got an Oreo shake that was so well made. Easily one of the best burgers I've had in the Charlotte area.,positive
"For a restaurant that opened today, one would expect for them to have a few glitches/mishaps on the orders. We ordered 8 different orders today for our office, everything came out perfect and made to order. The staff was friendly and processed everything efficiently. The owner was present and patient with staff members as, again this was their first day, they were still learning. The pricing was a bit high and no daily lunch specials were offered. Everyone agreed that the burgers were juicy, good quality, fresh, and very large. The French fries were cooked to order, seasoned perfectly. Definitely will return, just not frequently due to pricing.",positive
Been coming here for special occasions plus usually once a month for 50 years! Although the food quality and portion sizes have diminished a bit it's still one of my favorite places to eat. I highly recommend the cheese lasagna with meat sauce pizza is also yummy.,positive
Don't go here cause it was recently shut down due to a problem with cockroaches. Although I haven't been here for years knowing the health department shut them down-that's all I need to know.,negative
"Just waited 10 minutes for a table. No line really, unless you count the 2 people who followed us in and subsequently left after 5 minutes. We chose to give them additional time to get it together. After being told twice it would be just a minute and being ignored by multiple employees just peeking around the corner or walking past us, we left. All this while the restaurant was barely half full and half a dozen empty tables remained unbiased. Unacceptable!",negative
The Italian Beef sandwich was very flavorful and melted in your mouth.Yummy. The house salad was crisp and we really liked the sweet house dressing. Quiet place where you could hear !!,positive
"Absolutely horrendous. I decided to chose this place to order off GrubHub instead of Olive Garden. Bad decision. I ordered clam linguine, which comes with a side salad and your choice of bread & calamari. Where do I begin? The calamari was obviously from a frozen package. Super chewy and tasted like a fried peice of rubber. The clam linguine? PSA: Do not expect to find any cans of clams at your local supermarket. All of them have been used in this bowl of linguine. I would have prefered 3 peices of REAL clam instead of those huge portion of salted rubber on my bowl. Ontop of that, it was SMOTHERED in oil. (See pictures above). I ended up scrapping the clams off and using the marina sauce from the calamari in the pasta. The salad was the only edible part of this meal, and even then, I used my own ranch dressing instead of the oil grease that came with it. As I began eating the salad, I noticed this dried up black speck. Ended up being a fly...................................................................................................... DISGUSTING ! $30 down the drain! I hope I do not end up with food poising in the morning! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!",negative
"My coworkers/friends I had eaten their 1x before and it was wonderful, food was good and service was mediocre but wasn't terrible. We decided to go again. Time #2 didn't go nearly as well. Salad dressing was runny, and by runny I mean, water with some flavoring. Service was again mediocre at best. My friends Alfredo was so dry she only ate like 2 bites. Nothing worse than having to take a whole meal home to doctor it in order to make it edible. It wasn't until ""we"" (as in all of us)were sick within hours of getting home from dinner, we began thinking less than the proverbial 5 stars were warranted. The next day my friend made a call to the restaurant and spoke to the owner Mary. The conversation with Mary didn't go as expected. What started as nice courtesy call turned into Mary making snide comments about if there were problems with her establishment then the Health Department would be there. Instead of being upset with the fact that patrons of her restaurant were ill after there visit she became defensive and offended by the call entirely. I think we would have gone back but after that disturbing interaction it has made us rethink it. Oh and on a different note all together there is NO PARKING and the hours are weird...closing at 8:30pm. To say the least we were terribly disappointed with this visit.",negative
"At 7 pm on a Saturday night, this place was, at best, maybe 1/4 full, not a great sign in itself-we waited about 5 minutes before a staff member came by and said ""someone should be with you soon"". Five minutes later, ""someone"" came by and seated us, not at one of the several available spacious booths, but at a small card table near the kitchen. We had to ask for water, which didn't come until much later. When our soup came, we had to ask for crackers-one package to split between the two of us is all we received. I decided to go all out and ask for my very own package of crackers and one package containing two saltines is exactly what I received. Generally, in an Italian restaurant, garlic bread with olive oil and Parmesan are brought with your appetizer. Nope. Supposedly, you had a choice of either garlic or regular bread with each meal, but when our meals came-no bread. We finally asked for and were given exactly one slice of bread each. Ok, let's talk about the meal. I had been going to this place for decades, and I have always ordered the same thing-half ravioli, half spaghettini. I started to inquire about this, and this random woman cleaning a table behind us chimed in quite loudly and aggressively ""we can't do that! That just isn't possible!"" Um, why would that be, exactly? It was ""possible"" the many other times I've been there, and, as both items are still on the menu, one puzzles over why this would suddenly not be ""possible"". Most business establishments realize that making their customers happy is not only good business, but a nice thing to do. But, ok, message loudly and clearly received. I picked the spaghettini and added meatballs. We placed bets on how many meatballs close to $5 extra would buy you at Manzella's. I bet 2, and I guess you could say I won if 2 meatballs for nearly $5 is winning-not sure I do, actually. Of our meals, mine was the most edible, and it tasted like a $20 bowl of Chef Boyardee spaghetteos. We all drank water, which we did have to ASK for and wasn't brought until our meal. I guess that's a good thing, and I wish we had drank it more slowly because that one glass was all any of us ever got. My pregnant daughter-in-law was trying desperately to get extra drops out of the glasses she was so thirsty, and my son gave up trying to get a refill. They were t exactly busy but, ok, whatever. By this point, we pretty much knew what the answer was going to be to this next question, but what the heck-we were there specifically because my son's birthday was a few days ago, and my daughter-in-law's is a few days away-this was turning out to be quite the birthday celebration! BIG shocker here-No, Manzella's could give a hot damn that you chose their establishment to celebrate your birthday in-no free cake (or even an extra package of saltines or a refill of that water you had to ask for!) So then the bill comes. My daughter-in-law had asked for Alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish. By this point, I'm fully expecting a pretty healthy up charge for that, although we weren't advised of it ahead of time. I mean, this entire thing, from walking in the door to paying the bill and never coming back had been so relentlessly mediocre at best, I really didn't think they could surprise me anymore. Then, I looked at the bill. And yes, there was an up charge of about $3.75 to switch the sauce-AND another $15.00 for a dish we didn't order, written right underneath the dish she DID order-with the up charge listed below it, then, apparently, the dish that would normally have come with the sauce she asked for, we were charged for too, but of course never asked for or received! If the good had been great, or the service out of this world (in a good way), maybe that would have mitigated some of the overall unpleasantness of this entire experience. Not a single one of us had a good meal, and we truly aren't picky or high maintenance. I've been a waitress, my sister is a waitress, I still work in customer service and know what people can put you through. We aren't complainers, we don't send food back if it's not perfect. My daughter-in-law's salad dressing was full of watery substance, my sauce was runny, and my son's ravioli was half cold, and we never sent anything back or asked for better, we just tried to eat as best we could and get out of there, agreeing that we'd never go back nor would we recommend it to anyone we didn't hate. This used to be a pretty good place to get a delicious meal at a decent price from friendly and attentive staff. Sadly, none of that is true now. By 8 pm, as I sat here trying to write this, the parking lot was completely empty on a Saturday night, so I don't really think my review is really much of a surprise to anyone.",negative
"One of the few places you can get really good, non-chain store, food anymore. Everything on the menu is delicious and the service is usually very good. My favorites are the Pizza, Italian Beef, Lasagna, and Spagettini with meatballs. The meatball sandwich is great too.",positive
"Short review- I've been going here since I could drive when this was one of the few games in town that served only Italian. Unfortunately nothing has changed since the good old days and I feel there are some definitely in need. We were greeted with the typical tepid response from mama Manzella once she realized we were there and taken to our table with little more than a word offered. My wife an I ordered our meals, veal parm for me and fettuccini alfredo for her. The salad that came with our entree's were swimming in water (I can assume it wasn't the dressing that was that watery) that they apparently forgot to wring out of the lettuce. There were a few raw onion rings and a roma tomato slice or two scattered on top of of a haphazardly put together bed of iceberg lettuce. The entree's came with little fanfare, my wife reported that her alfredo was on the low end of quality from what she has had in other establishments and my veal was tough and smothered in cheese which pretty much masked any other flavor lying beneath it. The spaghettini that I got as a side seemed to be covered in some sort of jarred sauce (Prego, Ragu?). There was tons of pasta on the side, more than I could ever consider finishing and the veal was borderline too much. I would think with the prices they charge, they could up the quality and cut on the portions and make it a trade off monetarily. All in all I don't know what we will ever go back. I really want to like this place and I would REALLY like to support a local town staple but I'm not going to pay good money for that. Sometimes it's good to reinvent oneself and their quality and menu could use a big makeover. I am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return.",negative
"Back in CU for the holidays....boy were we disappointed. Used to love thisplace..but really gone down in quality and service. Ordered the Antipasto, which I used to enjoy when Frank was there....I got a place of lettuce with a few packaged pepperoni and NO KALAMATA olives or any type of olive at all...no pepperchoni,,,,9 dollars and change. Absolutely terrible. Pasta was cold...Service was slow with few customers...would not be surprised if this place closed soon. If youthink this s the ld MANZELLA..forget it...not as good or even close to what it used to be!!!!!",negative
"Restaurant hasn't changed in more than thirty years and is very dated. The food is generally good, and service is average.",negative
Had lunch there on a rainy day. The light was dark so I did not enjoy eating there. The food was just so-so. No much choice on the menu. Don't know if they had another menu for dinner.,negative
This place is ahh mazing!! The boy Eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute. He washes the dishes but told me that he doesn't wash his hands so.. Only four stars.,positive
"I'd really say its about 2.5 stars. It wasn't horrible but it was definitely forgettable. The place smells dirty. Greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty. The decor is 70s kitschy, and that's okay. But the real reason I go out is for good food and to be served. I thought the prices were high for the food quality. $12.95 for spaghetti? Really? The tomato gravy was okay. Thick and sweet. It would be good on pizza. But they don't use enough mozzarella in their various dishes, garlic seems largely absent, and the food was tepid. (I had the baked lasagna.) When we arrived it wasn't busy, but the service was sub par. Then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent. It's a pity too, because I love independent, non-chains and try to frequent those establishments. But frankly, next time, I'll go to the Olive Garden.",negative
"I loooooove this place! Very nice with a cute, homey, warm, dining room. Place has been around a very long time so don't expect it to be have an updated and elegant look. Always nice friendly service. Love the ranch salad dressing! Everything on the menu is yummy. My boyfriend loves the Italian Beef sandwich and it comes with a large basket of warm crinkle cut fries that I help myself to. I usually get the cheese filled ravioli and they are superb! Bread served with oil and parmesan cheese. They have a large dining room to the side for very large parties and celebrations. I have never had a bad meal or experience here. My boyfriend and I love it.",positive
"If you're looking for something a bit more upscale than Za's on campus and Biaggi's is out of your price range, Manzella's is the place to go. The portions are big but are slightly pricey. They have a small menu but their speciality is a ""make your own"" past dish. They also have a handful of baked pastas which I found to be good as well.",positive
Food was overpriced and not that great. Slow service wouldn't even refill my drink. Interior is dingy and the tables were sticky I would not recommend this place.,negative
"I love Manzella's! My family and I have been coming here for years and usually celebrate my b-day here! The vibe inside is very cozy and old school- red pleather booths, wine bottles lining the walls, pictures of Italy, etc. I really like how this is a family-run restaurant and they are always there working and attending to customers. In addition, the prices are very reasonable and the staff is really friendly! 99.99% of the time, I order the cheese manicotti with meat sauce and it's huge- definitely large enough to share! I usually take at least 1/2 of it home for later. The pizza is awesome too! Overall, this is a great place to take a date or for a family gathering and I love that it's been around for such a long time. The food and service are great and consistent! :) PS: For those cold, snowy nights, they also deliver!",positive
"This is what I imagine the early Italian-American restaurants were like... Green can parmesan, Prego-like sauce, and supermarket quality dried pasta, enhanced by the decor of red-checker tablecloths and the chianti bottles. I ordered the linguine with white clam sauce. It was very brothy- notably lacking in garlic, or some kind of acid (lemon or white wine), and salt. All I want are fresh ingredients, toothsome pasta, and freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano... For most people this will probably fit the bill, mediocre Americanized red-sauce Italian but if you are like me, and make your pesto, marinara, and Alfredo from scratch, this isn't worth a trip.",negative
"An acceptable little Itali-American place. I give it four stars rather than five because a lot of their food is clearly not made ""in-house."" If it seems awfully familiar, it is likely it was shipped in from one of the many companies that supplies ready-made entrees. But it has a nice atmosphere and overall the food is satisfying, so I still recommend it for dates or family outings.",negative
"This is the real deal - a little Italy in itself. Dimly lit, checkered tablecloths, comfortable booths and Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling. Romantic, a popular Valentine's Day destination. One of our favorite places in Champaign. I love the chicken capperi - the wine sauce is incredibly delicious. Nice service. Save room for dessert.",positive
"Horrible food and service. I wouldn 't feed this to my dog. Tough bad steaks and slow service. Group waited for over an hour for our food and then it was bad, really bad. Dirty restaurant. Where's the food inspectors.",negative
"Holy cow! The steak is awesome! Dudes, I am not kidding you, go here and order the steak. I was nervous going in, wearing my Bears shirt, but they were awesome. There was one guy, Hank, he tried to be a loud mouth about how bad the Bears are, I used my incredible Karate sills and gave him a roundhouse kick to the shin. Everyone started applauding me and we had fireballs as Hank laid on the floor crying like a baby.",positive
"This is an old style tavern slash restaurant. Typical for the region. It is located across the driveway of the McGovern Hotel and Suites. The hotel offers a free drink or beer with thier check in, I'm good with that! Felt like something simple and fish and chips has been on my mind for a few days. So I got comp'd my IPA and had the fish and chips. It was pretty good and satisfied the needs. Was looking at the menu and mentioned pie ala mode.....so I asked and they no longer have pies. Kinda bummed....now I'm going to think about pie all night.",negative
An old supper club feel..... I doubt the place has been updated in the past 3 decades. But the food and service was good. Definitely will go again!,positive
"McGovern's is a old school supper club and bar. They have nice wait staff and bartender's and there outdoor deck is a relaxing on a pleasant day, and ya they make a nice bloody Marys.",positive
"I never thought I'd write about a fast food place let alone McDonald's. This one on Hampshire gate deserves special recognition. It was a happy place when my kids worked there more than15 years ago. In addition, the food didn't taste as if it was sitting on the warming rack for any length of time. after many years away, I returned to this place on the past two Sundays. The breakfast was hot and freshly made and the service was exactly the same as it was 15 years ago. The servers were smiling, pleasant and a little bubbly. Well done to this McDonald's crew and managers!",positive
"This is the rare McDonald's I've visited where I've been able to see how it operates both during the day and in the middle of the night. When I used to work at Best Buy doing the night shift for a seasonal position, my co-workers and I would drive over at 3 in the morning across the lot to this place and meet a helpful cashier named Maggie, who was always cheerful and prompt with service. Though the food always took a long time to arrive (usually due to the fact that it was sparsely-staffed and nobody seems to have much initiative to want to cook), it was a surprisingly solid experience and the reason why I put this location a slight cut above others in the city. On the other, the restaurant itself is a total nightmare during the day. If it's not the long lineups, it's the absolute anarchy that goes on inside the restaurant with people yelling and shouting for orders. Even on days where you'd think it wouldn't be busy (like a Wednesday afternoon or a Sunday in general), the place is packed full of crying kids, annoyed customers and staffers who seem to be one step away from losing their cool. I actually visit this place fairly often whenever the family goes out to run errands on the weekend. Despite that, I would strongly suggest not waiting in line to order. Use the touchscreen kiosks whenever possible and get your order as quickly as you can. It's not worth it to brave the lineups -- these are some of the worst I've seen outside of the Yonge/Dundas location. Likewise, the parking lot is always a mess with long lineups for the drive-thru, people loitering in their vehicles and cars speeding through to the exit. If you come on a non-peak hour, the experience is okay, but stay far, far away if you see that it's busy.",negative
"Wow, the self serve kiosks are very interesting. You can pay in plastic at the kiosk or pay in cash at the counter (only 1 register) No that there are no more cashiers there are a few people roaming the restaurant greeting people to use the kiosks and offer refills and other services for customers. Staff was nice and friendly. With the kiosks however, I found it quite difficult to modify drinks. I like having my iced coffee with milk instead of cream for instance.",negative
"Don't care about the customer, or their request. Simple order of a Hamburger with no onions (kids hate onions) a large fry... and chicken nuggets with BBQ sauce. What do we get... burger with ""Onions"" NO fries...??!!?? And sweet and sour sauce. My son asked for some fries while we were driving home when I noticed. The sad part is that I had to go to another McDonald's to get him fries. At least they had a smile at the drive thru. I called the location to give some constructive criticism and let a Manager know the experience I had in case this is an internal issue BUT no one answered the phone. Again, I repeat.... NO customer service, don't care about the consumer, STAY CLEAR from ownership like this. Way to treat the kids... Way to GO McDonald's.",negative
"One of my favourite McDonald's to come to. It's relatively large compared to the majority of the company's locations.....it even has a play place for kids. The walls and seating are beautifully decorated, with a variety of seating styles (tables with chairs, lounge chairs, booths, stools, etc). Employees are very friendly, helpful, and can actually get orders out within having to wait a lifetime. I also enjoy how they play music from the 50s/60s.....my personal favourite decades of music, it just makes the experience that much more enjoyable. They also have a two-lane drive through, so, really, you can't go wrong with this location!",positive
A great place to have a quick breakfast. Very casual. Loved the French-Italian combination of food here! The bakery is packed with tasty and sweets goodies. The sandwich selection is very impressive.,positive
"I've been coming to this bakery with my family and myself for the last 15 years or so, and I swear, the chocolate almond croissants never fail to disappoint! Each pastry is flaky, crumble, crispy, sweet, and salty all in one and is a definite pit stop every time I go to Yorkdale. Personal favourite is the spinach and feta pastry :)",positive
"I find that this Michels doesn't taste as yummy as fairview mall. Fairview mall location has more selection with desirable options. Most of the pastries in Yorkdale Michels are hot dog or raisin lol. Fairview offers a lot more and their pastries are made bigger. It is a hefty price for mall food, but I guess its a better choice compatibly to the food court",negative
"Not bad, just nothing special. Michel's Bakery Cafe is inside Yorkdale Mall. There's a lengthy wait, especially on the weekend and if you want to get a seat. Instead, I just had some pastries to go. The lineup is about 5-10 minutes, at 4pm in the afternoon. They offer bagels, croissants, buns, Danishes and other pastries. I tried one specialty chocolate croissant and another cheese and jam Danish. Total added up to $7.35 including tax. They tasted meh, maybe even a bit dry. It wasn't bad, but just nothing special. It tastes the same as the pastries at the grocery store. They have a good display and presentation. But I feel like this place was more hype - you are only interested because you see a long line and big crowd.",negative
"Looks like I forgot to review this place! We visited Michels at the end of December, during the holidays so you can imagine the line up at Yorkdale to get a seat. We waited for a while but luckily got a place. There is so much to choose from - sandwiches, soups, baguettes and a huge assortment of delicious pastries. Naturally, I opted for the broccoli and cheese crossaint with a mocha and was extremely satisfied with my selection. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious and price is also quite reasonable - on par with most coffee shops. It was a little noisy and cramped as tables were squashed snugly next to each other but I think that's the charm of such places! My husband and I both enjoyed it and queuing up was definitely worth it!",positive
Wow what a good find I always past by this place and never eat here cause the line ups are ridiculously long and it's crazy packed inside for a reason the food is fresh tasting!!! I did a take out and ordered some of the pastries a 6 pack box of any pastry in the front window was $15.75 not bad pricing for high quality patty the cheese croissant and broccoli cheese croissant was my favourite very fresh tasting at 8pm at night. I was very impressed with the quick service and many employees serving it up the line up was month but it did go fast they are fast fast!!! They usually have samples of breads or smoothies on the counter be sure to look out for those or even ask they are more than willing to place some. I had a pleasant experience very impressed with quality and service would be returning again thank you !,positive
This is a nice Michel's Baguette location. It opens early on Saturdays & it was already busy when we arrived. They have a nice seating area for those who want to eat off their deli style menu. They also have the quick service window where you can buy bread & pastries. Their loaves sell quickly & for the cranberry loaf they were baking a new batch. They said it wouldn't be ready for another 10 minutes. My mom decided to come back for the new batch but by the time we got back it was already sold out! For myself I bought a scone & it was delicious.,positive
I love everything. There's a lot of vegetarian options. The bread is perfect. This is my new bakery. I love this place so much. I live near there. I just want something different.,negative
Last Night! Dessert from a classic place in Yorkdale Mall! Michel's Baguette! I've always had a Love for this Classic Place! I would say its one of my favorite places! 5/5 Everything in there is Delicious!!,positive
Fresh bread and croissant makes everything so tasty. Great place to eat for lunch or snack especially after long hours of shopping,positive
Surprised at the value considering I'm in an upscale mall. Had a great blueberry Danish on a previous review recommendation. Also a German chocolate cake coffee. Better fare than Tims any day! Nice place to crash while wife hunts down sales.,positive
"What better place to have breakfast than here. The almond croissants are one of my favourites. The broccoli and cheese danish are impossible to miss. Get it warmed up, absolutely perfection. The staff is always perfectly friendly, and the environment is suitable for practically type of sit down breakfast. I've been there with my mother, boyfriend, family, friends, but it's still on the nicer scale with a good amount of class.",positive
"In my opinion, this is the ONLY way to do chocolate croissants. The spinach and feta is good too but my fav is chocolate. The food is always fresh and delicious.",positive
I just love this place! The soups I have had are flavorful (Tomato bisque reminds me of back home!) I like the feel of the whole place and the staff are always friendly to me. I recommend the grilled Cajun panini- it's superb!,positive
"There's nothing I enjoy more in this world then a freshly baked light and fluffy piece of bread! Most people do not understand my appreciation for bread, but I kidd you not, when they made the phrase, ""Man can't live on bread alone"" they clearly did not sample the whole population! I went here last weekend for lunch. Yorkdale is a pretty busy mall, and Michel's is no exception. There's two counters, one where you can go buy breads and other goodies from behind the counter, and then there's the line where you can buy food such as soups, sandwiches and desserts. For first timers like myself, it's all sorta confusing because the two lines intersect each other. I tried their onion and cheese bun, which was a good size and absolutely delish! They do have a pretty good size seating area so you can sit and eat. It's like a food court, only they have people to clear the tables. If you are lucky to find one that is clean during busy hours, then grab it. Otherwise you'll have to wait until someone comes to pick up the trays and plates. There is no designated place to put your used plates even if you wanted to clear your table for the next person. table",positive
"I don't know about others, their sushi bentos are suck, only three small California roll and even no avocado!? Seriously? and sushi rice are tasteless, it's totally not worth 15 dollars .",negative
One star for quick service. Food is MEH. Portions are measly. Ordered the tempura lunch box and it was a sad portion of food. Steamed Rice wasn't even a cup full. More like 1/3 cup only. Miso soup was full of oil. WILL NEVER COME BACK,negative
"The first time I have come here to eat Sushi. Not so many people, staff are friendly and professional. However, in my opinion, the price is not cheap. Order more Salad is more $5 and Salmon is 4 pcs.",negative
I work nearby so I come here for takeout lunch daily. I love their sashimi lunch special and their Boston roll! The sashimi is always fresh and tastes right. The lunch and special rolls come with Miso soup and a salad. Pro tip: be sure to ask for their loyalty / stamp card if you find yourself coming back more than once. I didn't realize it until I was 5 visits in!,positive
"quality of sushi was great also service was efficient prices were decent. only thing was i experience some rudeness due to miscommunication and language barrier. I came back with a group of friends and experienced good service by the waitress. as well, the selection is pretty amazing and the food is quite filling. I would definitely come back now, and will probably be a regular and perhaps my first time visiting was just a communication error...lost in translation with the nonspeaking english woman.",positive
Came here for take out during the weeknight. I wanted to try a different sushi place in the area. Friendly staff and ordered a Dynamite roll. Can't screw up a dynamite roll. I like that they have stamp cards as well.,negative
Omg i just had the spiciest ... Spicy salmon in my life it was so good !!! My mouth is on fire but omg did I ever like it,positive
First time here. Def. Not our last. At first glance the prices are a little high but we were like we'll maybe it's really good. And then you find out you get a soup and salad as well... Not bad. Then the rolls come 10 huge pieces and we'll rolled. Still warm with the tempura. So for $10-15 on average you are getting more then your moneys worth. And on top of that our server filled our water without asking and even went out of her way to find out what a sauce contained. We ordered a spicy salmon and scallop a green dragon roll and spring rolls. And there was leftovers with 2 people and we only had to pay $33. Easily my new sushi place.,positive
Amazing food and great service. The workers arr all friendly and ensure that our expectations have been met. The food is also fresh and the place is very clean. I will definitely recommend this hidden gem,positive
Sushi rolls are pretty large and fresh. My fav are the shrimp rolls and vegetable tempura. They give you a complimentary miso soup and salad with the order which are pretty filling. Nice Sushi option near Distillery.,negative
The sushi is fresh and good. Mr Miyaki makes all the sushi himself and the wait staff is so friendly. I love the rolls and they have a buy 10 get one free. The CAA roll and Yasaii roll are two of my favorites.,positive
"Confession: I have a soft spot for mom & pop operations like this. I was a regular here for almost 8 years before I changed jobs and moved out of the city. Hard working and generous too - they would usually give my co-workers and I complimentary appetizers whenever we decided to treat ourselves and dine-in instead of the usual take-out... ok, I might be a little biased due to the VIP treatment. If you're stopping in for lunch, don't waste your time with the menu, just go with the Spicy Maki lunch combo. The old office almost exclusively ordered this at lunch. 6 pcs of spicy salmon, 6 pcs of spicy tuna salmon, AND miso soup and salad for $10.95? Hello, yes please. The rolls are good balance between fish and rice, no inch-thick rice filled rolls here. More importantly, they high turn-over at lunch ensures the fish is always fresh! Bonus: if they're not too slammed at lunch, the chef will add his signature twist to the maki roll and place 2 small pieces of sashimi on top of the rolls. Have I had better sushi? Absolutely. Have I had cheaper? For sure. But I'd say as far as value goes, this is one of Toronto's hidden gems. Hard to beat the quality of the food that you get given the price point. And please don't misunderstand me, this is NOT bad sushi at all. Just solid no-frills sushi, like the Honda Civic of sushi. And the staff are just super nice to boot. The only negative thing I'll say is that if you're dining in on a busy day, sometimes the staff can get a bit frazzled. Don't take offense and just kindly flag the waitress down and let her know what you want. Some people may give it 3 stars, they probably aren't regulars. English isn't a strong point for the staff so they may seem stoic and stand-offish. But if you make the effort to engage them they will definitely try to reciprocate! If not with their words, then maybe with a little extra piece of fish ;) Good people, good food, good value. Recommend!",positive
"While the service was very friendly and fast at Miyaki, I found the food to be subpar. As much as I wanted to enjoy this smaller ""mom & pop"" sushi place, the rolls were nothing memorable. The quality of the food matches the lower price. Nothing inedible or terribly wrong with the food, just nothing to get excited over.",negative
Went on a not so busy Friday afternoon for lunch. Was very disappointed with the spicy chicken bento. It was the worst food I have had in Toronto. The service wasn't too great either. The waitress seemed too busy to even come back to our table to refill our water. The sushi which came with the bento box was acceptable. Will never go back.,negative
"Authentic sushi in an unassuming location. There aren't very many affordable, Japanese-owned and operated sushi joints, but this one is a perfect neighbourhood joint. Excellent, fresh sushi and other sushi-based Japanese dishes. Prices are reasonable, but not cheap. Staff are friendly and helpful, and extremely polite. Absolute best value is weekday lunch specials.",positive
"Picture this: it's Saturday night, your dinner plans fall through, and you have several friends coming into the city (some of whom are hungry) at various times (some as soon as an hour from now), you still haven't gotten ready, what do you do? I quickly get on Yelp and do a search for nearby sushi restaurants (since that seemed to be the order of the day) that are open and do delivery. Enter Miyaki Sushi, right on the Esplanade. I called them up only to find out that they don't deliver (either that or their delivery guy was unavailable), but they were close enough that I could pick up. I placed an order for a truckload of sushi and was shocked when they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Just as I was about to head out the door, I was surprised to receive a call from them saying they'd need another 15 minutes. I was actually quite pleased by the consideration they showed in calling me rather than having me wait at the restaurant. Quickly got showered and changed and headed with a friend to the restaurant. I discovered that the place was a homey mom'n'pop type place and was greeted by a cute little Japanese (?) hostess who actually brought the food out to my car. They even threw in some dumplings on the house and some ego-boosting compliments to boot. Right then I knew they were getting a good Yelp review, but it certainly didn't hurt that every single one of my guests raved about the sushi. It was incredibly fresh and their signature rolls just melted in your mouth. I also felt it was a pretty good value as we were able to feed 8-10 people on under $200 and even have some left over for later.",positive
"I just found out about the place, living about a 7 minute walk away. I was really craving sushi and Sobey's barely had any left. With the bright sign outside, I decided to drop in. I had a look at their take-out prices - as a student I found it a bit more expensive than usual. I decided to get the M2 Salmon and Californa roll, it was 6 pieces for $7.50 (8.48 after tax) I got my order in about 5 minutes. It's delicious! I have to try out their lunch specials soon. The service there was friendly, they're all korean.",positive
"This is a slightly biased review. I grew up on an island (Ireland) surrounded by rivers, seas and an ocean but still managed to spend my lifetime deciding I didn't like fish. I eventually realised I could eat tuna a couple of years ago but that was as far as my fish eating went. Raw fish? Out of the question. Fast forward to yesterday. I happened to be in the area at the same time as a friend and he was starving. He's a regular here and was in the mood for sushi. I wasn't hungry but said I'd come along for a chat. I went through that slightly awkward moment where I had to tell the woman serving us that I only wanted water but she was completely sweet about it. She was so sweet that she came back with salad and miso soup for both of us! I thought that was just the nicest touch. She returned a little later with his rolls-spicy salmon and tuna ones which looked huge. We decided that it was time for me to be adventurous and taste some. My first taste of sushi ever. Remember, I don't like fishy things. This was yummy! I ate 2 pieces each of the tuna and the salmon and loved them. Not fishy; just tasty, meaty and satisfying. It was a revelation! Everything tasted fresh and our service was so friendly and smiley that I couldn't help but feel happy. So this will be forever remembered as the place I first ate sushi and liked it. Not fishy fish that a non fish-eater will eat? That's impressive!",positive
"Been here 3 times and have to say service is pretty good (when they are open on time), food usually not bad although sometimes dried out, and prices are for the most part decent. I'll start by saying that one of the times I visited Miyaki close to its opening time, there was nobody to be found. I guess they must've been running late, but it made my trip there a bit of a waste. That experience aside, I've found the service to be friendly and efficient over-all. Last night I ordered my meal as ""take-out"" and the speed at which it was prepared was decent at 15 minutes. The prices are pretty good, where for the most part, each piece of sushi/maki would cost $1 or less. The quality of the food I had last night however wasn't the best at all. Most of the pieces looked dried out and I had a stomach ache for several hours after having it. There were pieces that tasted rather fishy and the rice as well as the fish did not look very fresh (looked like they had been out for extended periods of time after having been prepared). The ginger was also served with the plastic it came with which didn't impress me. In the past, the quality of the food has been more decent with little to no pieces of the sushi ordered looking dried out or stale and the taste being respectively decent, with no following stomach pains after being done. Considering the health issues I had last time I visited, I don't see me returning to Miyaki, as it seems to be hit and miss when it comes to the quality of the food, and that's something I'd rather not risk.",negative
"I ordered the pot stickers here, and they were tasteless. I make my own dumplings at home, and even mine were better than the dumplings I had here. If you're looking for authentic Chinese dumplings that tastes good, this is not the place to go.",negative
"4th time visitng this place and my 1st time getting bad service. the 3 of us arrived and waited to be seated. at least 4 servers passed us without acknowledging that we were there. eventually we were seated. my friends and i ordered the steames pork and chive, the pan fried shrimp dumplings, shrimp fried rice and the mafo tofu. they all tasted very good and authentic. the pan fried dumplings could have been more crunchy. the shrimp fried rice tasted better than it looked. when they first brought the rice out we were disappointed to say the least...no visual appeal what so ever. the tofu on the other hand looked and tasted so savoury. it came with a meat sauce. i normally don't enjoy soft tofu but this was done to perfection",positive
Great dumpling place on Spadina. Service isn't quick but when you are with a group catching up there's no worries there. Lots of vegetarian and regular options. The tea was refilled quite a bit and that's enough to keep me coming back.,positive
"WOW! Had selected another place from Google, but asked the hotel Concierge where they thought was bet. They sent us here. Loved the atmosphere, loved watching the ladies hand make the dumplings, and LOVED the dumplings! Watched many wonderful smelling items go past us. We settled on a smaller lunch, with my wife and I splitting a bowl of hot and sour soup (VERY flavorful!), and an order of pork dumplings. Good entrees on the menu. I spied the General Tso's, and a couple of noodle items, too.",positive
"Came in for a late lunch with two friends. We got quick and friendly service. We ordered some spring rolls, fried rice, kimchi, seaweed salad, and a whole bunch of delicious dumplings to share. Everything was flavourful, enjoyable, and affordable. I will be back for more.",positive
"In LOVE !! I am currently obsessed with Mother's Dumpling. Always pass by and never found a reason to stop by. I mean, its dumplings. My mom makes dumplings. How can one place just sell dumplings. So i did it. I dropped by and it was packed! We were quickly seated since it was just the two of us. We sat down and was quickly served water and was given the menu along with a menu sheet. Which makes ordering so much easier. Very much like those dim sum places. You write down how much of what you want. No miscommunication. There is a middle part of the restaurant where it was kind of a ""open kitchen"" concept. There were clear windows and you can see the dumpling chefs make the little pockets of sunshines! It reminded me of home, seeing my mom and grandma gossiping while making happiness. Their dumplings were divided into categories. Steamed, boiled, and pan fried. There were also soups, appetizers, and main dishes. We ordered steamed chive and pork dumplings and panfried shrimp and pork dumplings. On the table there were your sauces! The sou sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, chili oil paste and etc. Our dumplings came and omgahhh it was so good!! You can tell you were having the most authentic dumplings Toronto has to offer. I was so happy with my experience there, I brought my cousins there the following week! If you want some authentic dimplings, a taste of china, come here. You wont be disappointed. Happy Belly :)",positive
"Place was clean. Service was good. Dumpling was not tasty. I've had better dollar dumplings in NYC. The skin of the dumplings just didn't have the right mouth feel. The boiled ones felt a little too thick, doughy, possibly undercooked. The steamed ones were rubbery and disappointing. The filling inside the dumplings were small and minimally flavorful.",negative
"Amazing quality food, the dumplings are made fresh and the best in the city! Some of the dishes tastes like the way my mom made them for my brother and I when we were kids. Brought back so many great memories. The service here is terrific. Very friendly and unexpected in Chinatown. I work at a hotel and when the guests want good Chinese food, I send them here. This is the authentic stuff right here!!",positive
"Food are not bad. Only thing is waiting time is sooooooo long! I've been there for two times, first time was eat in and second time was takeout. Both I've ordered fire dumplings and it just made you to wait for more than 25 mins to get your food. You may died if you are starving",negative
"Food was a-ok. Lots of selection to choose from and the flavours were quite authentically Chinese. Siu Long Bao was delicious and very juicy! My only quip is that it's expensive for dumplings, but I'm comparing to suburb prices. And I know that Chinatown Spadina strip is more expensive. But all in all, I would come back.",positive
"Watching the staff here handmake the dumplings right in the middle of the restaurant got me pretty exciting about Mother's Dumplings. However, both times I went here my table was forgotten about and we either got our food after waiting over an hour and asking about our order multiple times, or we just paid for the one item that came to us and left before we got to eat the rest of our order because they had clearly forgotten about us and our order (forcing us to go eat somewhere else, because needless to say, we were still hungry). So disappointing. I guess this handmade dim sum is just not in the cards for me.",negative
Good stuff!! We ate a lot of dumplings...especially the juicy pork one!! The service was great and we were not an easy group: Children and people coming and going but they looked after us well!,positive
We've been this place several times. Everything is yummy. Their dumplings are hand made. You can see them making dumplings in the kitchen.,positive
This place really deserves better ratings than it currently has. It's located just down the street from the University of Toronto. It's usually fairly crowded but the wait is worth it - the dumplings taste great.,positive
"The dumplings are good even tho the wait and service can be a bit frustrating. There's a few other dumpling places around this neighbourhood but this place is my go to, they have chicken and veg options....",positive
"Fantastic! Delicate and subtly flavored, but hearty and delicious. We seemed to be served by whoever was nearest rather than one person - I definitely loved the cooperative family atmosphere. There was a light, fragrant aroma to the dumplings, almost Jasmine or lavender like, barely perceptible but that absolutely made my meal. Service is sweet, portions are good, presentation great (adorable dessert dumplings!), food is fresh and delicious, and I LOVED watching the cute ladies make dumplings and wave at the babies brought by to watch. I'll go against popular opinion here and say the chive pancake, while good, wasn't my favorite. But I loved the steamed bakchoi and mushroom. This is a place I'm happy to recommend and revisit and give my money to! I foresee many a dumpling craving in my near future. I will say the setting/dishes/condiments etc are rather dirty...",positive
"I used to go their old location on Huron St back in day 1 since couple years back. Food were ok but we don't go to the Spadina location anymore as there was a horrible problem everyone need to be careful about: there are something like mechanical black grease always stick around the bowl, dishes or tea cup. It happened several years ago at my last 3 visit. I called up the manager to tell him about the problem and he told me not to look at the grease at the button of my bow but look inside. I gave up and walk away. 3 years later, I came by last week and thought maybe I was in bad luck last visit and decide to give them a try again. I ordered my dishes and ready to enjoy my tea. Here go again....... My tea cup I found 3 black dots inside the cup and my fingers felt like the same black mechanical grease again. The waiter no1. Apologized and gave me another new cup. Here go again, another cup with black grease dots again. This time waiter no2.came around the tried his fingers to get the grease out and promised he will get a clean cup to me. The new cup end up also from the same dishwasher tray had the same black grease that splashed all over the all the dish and cup. I called up the manager who was in eyeglasses and complaining about the situations which made me losing my appetite tonight. He denied there were anything wrong with the dishwasher but mentioned something that I might need to go check in with my eye doctor. Here I walked out from this place again and never want to come back again. Not because the food but this place had a very serious health problem the manager tried very hard to ignore the same old problem that had existed for so long. I really don't know how many customers they had in the past had these chemicals into their tommy. I don't think I am the only one who is aware of this horrible things happened everyday in this place. I will call up the city to see about the food safety problems they have for so many years. I always love to try dumpling from different restaurant around Chinatown but this place I will never come back again.PLEASE, EVERYONE CHECK OUT YOUR DISHES, BOWL AND TEA CUP BEFORE ORDER YOUR FOOD THERE,PLEASE DO CHECK THEM FOR YOUR SAFETY'S SACK!!!!",negative
The best dumplings in Toronto. They also have very good pancakes & noodles. Their menu is helpful for vegetarians since they offer veggie choices for many of their menu options.,positive
"Went there for a dinner on a weeknight and loved the dumplings! We ordered: Steamed dumplings B2 (melon, tofu, vegetable noodle) and B9 (juicy pork bun). Both were delicious and I somehow managed not to burn myself with the juicy pork ones, so that's a plus. Steamed buns E3 (vegetarian) were good too, not as amazing as the dumplings, but the filling was really tasty. Side dish of I8 (large assorted salad) came with 4 different salads (peanuts, dried noodles, bean sprouts, and cabbage strings). This was decent and i enjoyed the variety, but it could have been better.",positive
"This place is AMAZING!!! The pork and bok choy fried dumplings were divine.... They were so good I went to talk to the manager to tell the chef how much I enjoyed them. They tasted freshly made and we're fried well. The smashed cucumber salad was also ridiculously delicious. This place is lightyears ahead of the Dumpling House also on Spadina. The restaurant was clean and staff were efficient and really nice. Damn Mother's Dumplings! I was seriously in heaven when eating there today. I'm craving more dumplings already. Will be back ASAP, you made me so happy with your delicious dumplings!",positive
"Came here years ago with people from work when it was back on Huron st. A bunch of people at work swore by the place, so we went there for a work celebratory lunch. The food was excellent and I had to come back. The green onion pancake haunted my dreams. Since then, I have come pack 20 or more times, and taken handfuls of new people to it. Everyone has always enjoyed the pancake, and I can only recall one person not enjoying it. (but she was 23 and had no taste... she said she preferred New Ho King across the st, which I had the other week and it was nasty). Overall the best things to order are the dumplings. They are made fresh and you can see them being made as the kitchen is behind glass. My favourites are the beef and chive, and whole wheat ones with the pickled cabbage. These dumplings pack flavour. I will admit, I have had bad service there before in a large group... not very friendly for large groups. Looking for a place to take a first date? And you are in yours 20s and you are short on cash, but want a tasty meal? This place is for you.",positive
"2 years later and you still make my heart swoon. Delicious boiled dumplings (more bang for your buck than the steamed) and the surprisingly delicious wonton soup. What's new since my last review? Menu remains pretty consistent, but check it out! There have been sightings of western (aka, um, not Chinese) servers and yes! Even cooks! Mother don't discriminate! You continue to be my default spot for a meal that's cheap, cheerful, and that always hits the G-spot. And that's G for ""goodness"".",positive
"Come here for the soup dumplings, which aren't the best ones I've had, but are solid. And you can get them at all in Toronto, whereas they seem to be missing here in Berlin. Anyway, the bottom line is. Soup dumplings: YAY! Other dumplings: Yay! Scallion pancakes: ok. Speed at lunch: reasonable. So maybe it's all nostalgia, but 4 stars.",positive
"I really like Mother's Dumplings. The 'egg and chives' pancakes, the 'beef and celery' boiled dumplings and the 'shrimp and egg' steamed dumplings are my favorites. The pancakes come in a serving of four and for the dumplings you have an option of choosing to order a serving of 12 or 24 dumplings. I normally order the smaller portion of 12, and this is more than enough food to satisfy a meal for two average sized people. I just wished they offered pan fried dumplings with something other than pork filling, as I don't eat pork : / ... one star off for this. Mother's dumpling is a yummy, very reasonable and clean dumpling house that I will always go to to get my dumpling fix.",positive
"Love this place! It's truly value for money. Tasty dumplings and quick service. I would recommend the pork & dill dumplings, the wonton soup and the green onion pancake. Very satisfying! Since discovering it a few months ago, I have already visited it 4 times!",positive
"As previous reviewers noted, this is more for round eyes (like me). Dumplings were okay but lacked the flavour and oomph i want in Chinese food. Some disappointment in non-dumpling fare. Yes, clean and cheap - but need more bang for the buck.",negative
"Mama's Dumpling, I love you. I wish my mama made food like this (or then again not because I'd weigh a solid ton). I've eaten here for a week in a row and not gotten tired of it. Really. As the title suggests, DUMPLINGS are the key dish. Here are the highlights, the must haves amongst the dumplings (and not in any particular order): Juicy pork buns. The vegetarian dumplings with mushroom/bok choi/tofu. Beef and chives pork and chives Chicken and mushroom Pork and bak choi - steamed or crispy Dumplings are the ultimate comfort food! The beef pancake was also fantastic (but hey, I haven't sampled much of Chinatown) If you dine in, you get pots of tea with your order so I love coming in here and taking a long break. FYI, they take debit only. I really don't recommend anything seafood related here. I got a shrimp/egg/pork dumpling which was just terrible. I mean, it tasted like old, dirty cardboard (or how I imagine old dirty cardboard would taste...) It was just the combination...it just didn't work. Also avoid the pork and dill. I had a friend who had the noodle soup and gave it a ""meh"" review.",positive
"pros: good selections of veggie dumplings, decently priced, cons: bad service, inconsistent food quality and no visa machine.",negative
"I went to the actual real Mother's Dumpling on Spadina and they are both fantastic! Just a little note though, the soup dumplings @ mother's dumplings are actually dumplings in soup versus the northern style soup in dumplings.",positive
A hole in the wall that serves dumplings and other northern chinese snack fare. I'm a fan of the pork bak choi ones-pan fried of course with a lashing of black vinager and chili flakes on the side. The zha jian mian is also nice on a hot day-wheat noodles with a chinese pork 'bolognese type' sauce topped off with cool cucumber and cilantro. Corn flour dumplings are unique -they are delicious if you want to try something quite different for dumplings. This place is not too look at it and service can can be curt at times but still not bad to fill you belly for under $10.,positive
"Went in for the lunch special, we ordered crispy spring roll with noodle soup w/ chicken and crispy spring roll with rice and grilled beef. The food came out quick, maybe within less than ten minutes. For starters, the spring roll was basically oil with no veggies inside. The shrimp roll was decent. When it came to the main dishes, the noodle soup broth was bland and the chicken was rubbery and tasted as if it sat in the fridge for a long time. The only thing consumable was the broth. The rice and grilled beef dish was majorly just a pile of rice with 4 pieces of beef. The beef has an odd taste to it and also rubbery. I have had pho and rice dishes many times and was extremely disappointed. The food was barely touched since we did not feel comfortable with the circumstances of our food. When we approached the ""waitress"" about our food, she asked if we wanted something else, which we declined. After, she just walked away and brought out the manager. He told us that we sat there for over an hour (we were there for half an hour) and we did not say anything, not even listening to what we had to say. He just decided to yell over us the entire time, not allowing us to get a word out. He kept stating that we came to his restaurant just to talk. He basically said that he has never had a complaint, and continued to raise his voice, along with the waitress. After not being able to express how we felt, he told us to leave. As we walked out, he decided to tell, what I assume to be ""frequent customers"", about how we sat there for an hour and didn't mention anything bad about our food. I then told him that he should not be telling customers of the situation and he had terrible customer service. He then told us that he hopes to never see us again in his restaurant. Definitely will not be back here after the horrific customer service I received. We were not able to communicate with them as they wouldn't let us get a word out. I hope no one experiences what we just had to deal with.",negative
Very dissatisfied I ordered pad see ew and I got a whole bunch of veg and noodles covered in gravy?!? Eww so mad right now I was so hungry,negative
Great food there. Great customer service. Everything on the menu is so far worth the money you pay for. Has the tv on mostly funny videos gags. Keeping the atmosphere great. Really honest people. I left my phone once on the table and the guy quickly came outside to give me my phone. Definitely recommend people to go there.,positive
Restaurant looks nice (for pho restaurant standards) but I thought the food was just average. I had banh xeo (Vietnamese savoury pancake) which was advertised as their specialty dish but I've had better (banh cuon Thanh Truc at St. Clair and Runnymede is an example). Not enough greens and fish sauce. The pho was also just average and the side plate of garnishing was minimal.,negative
"Tip: Always look at the DATE of the review before checking a place out! A bit of a nosedive since my last visit. I had the ""Special"" pho, #1 I believe, and broth was bland (not complex enough, no anise flavour), and there were a couple of grisly, not super fresh pieces of meat that required the help of my back molars. Garnish (basil/bean sprouts), on the other hand, was fresh! I will give them that. And even though they are small, I do like their beef balls, but why is there always just ONE in the soup??!! C'mon now, put like 3 at least 'cause they're the size of a grape. Friend's pork chop was on the small side, which he was fine with, but it looked dry and he said it didn't taste good.",negative
"Ordered pho and veggie pad Thai. The pho was okay, not enough noodles and meats. However when my vegan bf asked for the veggie pad Thai (making sure there isn't any seafood in it.. some places throw in shrimp) we found chicken! We notified the server and she said that the chicken wasn't cooked with the Pad thai?? Didn't offer to do anything about it either.",negative
"Not authentic at all. I am Vietnamese and eat Vietnamese food all over the GTA. Cheap on condiments, way over priced. Not a single Vietnamese customer in the restaurant during dinner time... Now I know why. On top of that, charged me on items I did not order. Making up stories and lies accusing that I did order. Pulled out the paper she took our order on. Shows nothing we ordered and still tries to make a quick buck. She later on found out I was Vietnamese and started apologizing. What a joke. I'd give -5 star if I can.",negative
"This ""Pho"" noodle stop exceeded my expectations. As an avid traveler I got exactly what I wanted (vegan pho) and the food was served with passion and dedication! This family owed business is a great stop!",positive
"I love the option to have good Vietnamese food nearby and late at night. Ever since Pho Queen City changed their hours, this was no longer an option, until My Pho came along. Open til 4am on weekends, My Pho is easily open late enough to satisfy all but the latest of sleepers. They're even open til midnight on weekdays! The service for this time of night was as good as can be asked for. Food came out very fast and steaming hot. I enjoyed my bowl of bun bo hue, my favourite Vietnamese dish. It wasn't very spicy but the there was a good balance and there was a good variety of beef and vietnamese sausage to accompany the vermicelli noodles and vegetables. At 3am, the owner even came out once we were finished our dishes to give us each a bowl of ice cream - 2 black cherry ice creams and one strawberry. I'm not sure where the black cherry is from but it was delicious! Large pieces of cherries were found throughout. Really enjoyed my first visit to My Pho - I should be back here often.",positive
Overall a pretty good bowl of Pho. The broth started off a bit sweet but after squeezing a few wedges of lime into it the broth balanced out a bit more.,negative
The best tasting pho I've ever had. They always use fresh ingredients and no msg. The interior is clean and well maintained. The staff are all very friendly and efficient. They have always used fresh ingredients and the taste is always consistent.,positive
"I absolutely adore this place. It's my go to pho place in Mississauga, more so than pho mi 99. I've been coming here for a year and a half now and I LOVE it. The pho soup taste very different though from a year ago but I do like it better. The place is spotless and very chill and open, they have one TV at the front and music playing at a considerable volume. The service here is quick and friendly, not much interaction but every worker there is quite nice. Because I come here only on weekends (on my way to school), there are few customers so orders come rather quick. I LOVE the food here, good portion sizes and honestly quite cheap for great, decently healthy food. The pho here is my favourite, to me it's a bit sweeter and more fragrant (cinnamon is strong) which I love, the beef is tender and rare and a generous amount is given. If you have a small stomach, a small is definitely enough, they give a pretty big portion size. I also love the variety of candy given at the checkout counter, the middle age gentleman there (cook? Owner? Idk) is so sweet and always urges me to take more candy. Give this place a try, it's totally worth it.",positive
Update - they use MSG!!!!! Like clockwork 30 mins after I consume anything with NSG I get the sweats & have to rush to the bathroom. Not sure if ownership has changed. I am not going back anyways. Writing this as I am having my pho. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!!! First....I read an earlier review that said no MSG which is the only reason I came. Asked the server 3 times about it & she doesn't speak English well so I let it go. There is also no sign in the restaurant like a previous reviwer mentioned stating that they don't use MSG. I am ultra sensitive to MSG & symptoms usually start about 30 mins after I eat MSG laden food. Second...I ordered rare beef & got well done. Third...this is the saltiest pho broth I have ever had in my life!! I left half of it in the bowl & drank 2 glasses of water. Fourth....a Pho place that is practically empty around 12:30 - 1 pm on a Saturday?!?!?! That should tell you something. It was just me & another family in the restaurant. The search for non MSG pho in the west end continues....sigh.,negative
"The place is very clean and it says Fine Vietnamese restaurant. Which is why the prices were high. Not sure why some other reviews say the price was cheap? Maybe they haven't been to pho places in Toronto, Scarborough or North York. I ordered the large beef ball pho and yea the soap was not as salty as other places but large didn't seem very large. The amount of bean sprouts they handed me was so tiny. Much less than other Viet restaurants. See photo. My friend ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, $7 and boy was it lacking. 1 tomato, 3 small shrimps, and not much else (see photo). Totally unlike their amazing looking photo. For a fine dining restaurant, small portions and charging these prices it is definitely not value for your money. I would not return or recommend.",negative
"This is probably my new favourite Pho restaurant in all of Mississauga! I've been here numerous times and I can confidently say that the food is consistently well done as with the service. I have had their Pho and Vermicelli dishes and none of the times I've been here have I left disappointed or unsatisfied with any aspect of dining out. I really like and would absolutely recommend their Vermicelli dishes. Also, the first few times I've visited, I noticed they had a little sign explicitly stating they did not use MSG in their dishes, and also the adverse effects MSG had for health and after-effects. I was impressed in their awareness of cheats other restaurants use, and their decision to not advocate for it. This is definitely noticeable in their Pho broth since it tastes much more home-made and not overly salty... Service here is great as well. It is quick and efficient, and never have our orders come out wrong. The manager is also quite sensible since every time we come here as a larger group, there is always dessert on the house :) Atmosphere is also great since the restaurant has gone for the bright clean look with high ceilings and lots of natural light. I throughly enjoy dining here, and hope to be back soon!",positive
I visit from southern California and looking for a good and come across this place. I am very surprise how good the food is compare to little Saigon even. The manager great and honest at advising us which courses are best fit our taste. Ask for Huy the manager. I'll be back here on my next time in town.,positive
"This is actually my second review here. Strangely, my first review disappeared (and all the other reviews for this place, mostly negative, along with it) even though the only thing that changed with this restaurant is the management (not even the ownership, name, or location). Anyway, this review is more positive because the vermicelli dish I got was actually pretty good. They use thicker noodles here which I actually like more and it's pretty unique too. My only complaint is that the food came out barely warm, which happened the last time I came here too except that time it happened with the pho. It took them only about 5 minutes to get the food ready but I would've rather had it come out in 7 minutes and be hot.",positive
"Been here twice and both times I left completely satisfied! The customization option is a really nice touch - I usually just opt for Pho Dac Biet at all pho restaurants I go to but my boyfriend liked the 'Make Your Own' option here :) I've only eaten Pho both times so I can't really say much about the other food but this is one of the best pho I've eaten in Mississauga. Not just that, the portion was really good - the perfect amount of meat and noodles. Not to mention there is no MSG :P If I lived nearby this would probably be my go-to pho restaurant! Definitely recommend & will be returning to try out the other dishes :)",positive
"Atmosphere is really nice, I love the decor. Food is good I like how they don't use MSG, the pho broth seems more clear than other places I've been to. It's about $5.00 for a small vegetarian pho soup and $2.00 extra for two meat add ons. I wouldn't get the calamari as it was $8.50 and the portion was extremely small, and was only mediocre. I also ordered vermicelli which was really good. Overall it was OK. UPDATE/ next morning: my brother who ordered the rice dish with egg and chicken had an uncomfortable stomach this morning maybe the chicken was undercooked???",negative
Third time here as I like the atmosphere and the cleanliness. Plenty of parking as its in the same plaza as No Frills. Happy: The noodle soup was hot and satisfying. I devoured it as I was hungry and it didn't disappoint. The bean sprouts and basil were nicely displayed. My partner had the chicken pad Thai And it is a large portion for $9.50. Nicely displayed than other places. Love the carrot touch at the side. It's not too sweet which is great. A bit tangy. Verdict: I've already been back so definitely I would recommend this place. It also has eight booth seating which is nice.,positive
Found this place when seeking for some Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Pancake). They have so many options for Banh Xeo. We ordered one with pork&shrimp and the other with beef and mushroom. Love the crispy crust and the freshness of meat and the vegetable that comes with it. Definitely satisfy your eyes with such a colorful presentation. We came in for a treat as well when they just introduced the new dessert called Fried Mango Ice cream. Would definitely come back for more creative Vietnamese dishes here especially when they're all no MSG!,positive
"Very friendly and attentive service. I really appreciate it when Vietnamese restaurants offer vegetarian options, because I don't see much of it. Especially for the Banh Xeo, so good! We also tried the veggie spring rolls which were great as well.",positive
"Since firstly tasted Pho in The Vietnamese quarter of Paris a few years back, I've been a big fan of Vietnamese beef noodle AKA Pho. Throughout the years, I have been to at least a dozen of Vietnamese Pho places in GTA. When I stayed abroad, I also frequently looked for Pho restaurants in different countries. With my experience, it is fair to say, overall, this My Pho restaurant is definitely the best Pho place that I've ever been to. Previously, I visited this place under the old management once, but I wasn't too impressed at that time. However, the new management of this place seems to bring the quality of the food as well as many other important factors here to a satisfaction level beyond usual expectation. Therefore my review will only focus my experience with this place since the new management took it over in December 2015. I'm now a frequent patron of My Pho and here are the reasons why I like it so much and why I think it really stands out from any other Pho places: 1. Quality and size of food. Simply amazing! In comparison to any other chain Pho places, My Pho surely has better food quality. Taking the example of my all time favorite their Special Pho, not only their size is extremely filling (I usually order a large and I literally see a small mountain of assorted beef meat, sitting on top of some noodle. Upon finishing up, I won't feel hungry for at least 4 to 5 hours, while other places only maintain me for 3), the kitchen only uses the best material and soup stock as I can tell. The owner are also willing to listen to customers' feedback. One common thing with Vietnamese Pho is that they are sometimes heavy with MSG in their soup, which cause people to feel thirsty afterwards. So noticing such concern, the owner has changed the recipe of the soup and now it's MSG-free. Since then, I do feel the difference and I like it even more because it tastes only better and it's even healthier. I have also tried a few other dishes, like the curry, stay beef noodle, or the Saturday lunch special Vietnamese crepe, none of them ever lowered my expectation what this amazing place can produce. 2. Quality of service. Very friendly and caring. Once you enter, staffs will greet you immediately and serve you with a hot cup of water or tea, according to your preference. Once you place an order, expect it to come up quick enough to prevent you feeling boredom. After your food is served, not only the staffs and but the owner will also frequently come to check if you are happy with your order. I notice this place is a family run business, not the normal type of chain restaurant. Perhaps that explains why you feel always being treated so nicely and genuinely every time you visit. 3. Quality of ambience. Outstanding. Unlike a lot of Pho places where seats are arranged in a over-crowded manner, and tables are not so well kept, this place is spacious and fairly bright with its top down window storefront. It has marble tables and couch-like sofa for seating, great for lone wolf type of gourmet like me, or couples, or even larger family groups. I can tell that the staffs take pains to keep this place extremely clean as they are almost constantly doing the cleansing. Overall, the interior decoration are also way better than any other Pho pages I've been to. Well up to the standard of a decent family restaurant. 4. Pricing. Bang for your buck. After all the positives factors I've pointed out, I would like add the pricing of their menu is very reasonable. I usually end up paying around 11 bucks for a large bowl of Special Pho, tip and tax included. Unlike many other restaurants in the same group, this place also takes credit card, debit and cash, regardless the final amount is. They also the latest POS terminal (it's like an iPad) which works like charm when it comes to payment. It can even email your receipt to your email address! I don't think many restaurants can boast such great and flexible payment options. Just another reason why I love this place. In sum, if you are a big fan of Vietnamese Pho like me in Mississauga, don't ever miss an opportunity to visit this amazing place. Try their menu and I'm sure after that you would largely agree with me for the reasons why I love this place quite so :-D",positive
"Thinking of the funky Sophie's Cosmic Cafe in Kitsilano, Vancouver, I stopped in here to check it out, but the vibe was very different from the start. After having eaten breakfast several times at Dairy Lane, OEB, Red's and Galaxy diners here in the city, I ordered the bacon and egg breakfast, but from the get-go it smacked more of a truck-stop than a special place. The breakfast was average decent, but the coffee is regular lower level swill. With such stiff competition nearby who do the job much better, I won't be going back. Even if I won't return here, if anyone out there wants redneck-oriented truckstop-styled bacon and eggs or hotcakes, may suit you.",negative
"Food not great, French toast and fruit tasted like onions, obviously cooked in the same pan as other food. Hash browns not really hash browns, more like boiled potatoes thrown in a pan for 10 seconds. Sausage overly greasy. Staff were friendly though!",negative
Not the fanciest in town but still a good spot. You will most likely find room any time with minimal/no wait. Friendly service and good food (not a fan of the hash-brow to be honest). I think they deserve a way better ranking than currently.,positive
"What an adorable breakfast spot!! Absolutely loved it. The atmosphere - cheerful, friendly, with that funny decor making you feel dropped down into an early second half of the past century... Makes you feel like Marty McFly is going to pop by any moment. Food is excellent. Served quickly. Looks and feels like you are visiting good friends who care. Portion size and price are right. Everything is clean, and served with a smile! How did I manage to make it there just a few couple of times? Should have been way more frequent to Nellies... Absolutely recommended - especially if you are walking with your kid around the area and feel a bit hungry, just jump in! Wonderful family place.",positive
"While running some errands, D suggested we stop here for a bite. He hadn't been in years, and I'd never been so I thought it was a great idea. We were both starving and it was very cold out, what with it having snowed the last couple of days, so we popped in and were seated at a window booth. I tried the hot chocolate and Mr. Boring had water. The place is chaotic, there's no end of random old knickknacks to look at, so it took me a while to pick what to try and in the end I went with the Nellie's Hash done with chorizo. When the hash arrived, it was HUGE. When they say 'mountain' of hash browns they aren't exaggerating. They were more like fried potato chunks than hash browns, everything was sautéed well, and they were nice enough to do the eggs scrambled for me (I can't handle runny eggs). I had sourdough toast to go with it, but it was very hard to finish everything. It's your typical idea of diner food, lightly greasy but in a good way. I left absolutely stuffed and I needed help to clean off the plate because there was so much on it. The hollandaise was nice and thick, and there was plenty of it which is always good. When we were chatting as we were paying the bill she gave us some candy, which seems to be a thing at that place - they have a lot of lollipops and whatnot. I think next time I'd like to either try the pancakes or one of their omelettes.",positive
"I got food poisoning from their blueberry pancakes Wish they didn't re open terrible service Ridiculous prices,dirty environment",negative
First impression Really cute Warm cozy cambin old school diner. Excited for my BLT take the first bite of my hash browns which looked very homey greasy confront style I came to realize right away that I was also chewing on a long peace of hair. So that was a bummer. Other then that service was fantastic. Don't think I could eat there again. Our coffees where taken care of !,negative
"Just another greasy spoon diner. Not a huge selection on the menu, and the food was sub par. The service was great and the eclectic scenery was entertaining, but for a self-proclaimed foodie I wasn't impressed.",negative
"Walking along 17th St at 11am on a Thursday looking for a diner to eat breakfast at and then Nellies pops up. Exactly what we were looking for. I love the kitschy feel of this restaurant, stuff all over the walls, grandma style tables and a welcoming vibe. The servers were really nice and fast getting our coffee/tea over right away and helping with menu selection. I went with a gluten free BLT + a fried egg. They delivered a triple decker delight. The gluten free bread was actually very good as was the rest of the sandwich. The side salad was pretty plain but fresh and yummy nonetheless. My husband had the hash which was huge and he said was very delicious. Our diner style brunch craving was fully satisfied by Nellies.",positive
"This is genuinely one of my favorite places in my city. It's the kind of place that gets regulars because of its warm, 70s diner atmosphere. Want to feel like you're in a movie and eat a great breakfast at the same time? Bam. There ya go. I suggest this place to anyone visiting Calgary who loves diner food - definitely a must-see.",positive
"Great experience! The location is easy to find, and in a great area. The service was both quick, friendly and helpful. The menu had such a great variety, and the prices were reasonable. If you're looking for a hip breakfast in a cool area-this is for you.",positive
"It had been years since I've eaten here. After all the media attention regarding health concerns I stopped going. Now being so close, we decided to give it another chance for a Sunday breakfast. When we arrived I noticed nothing of the decor has changed much, in fact it may not have been cleaned very much either as I noticed layers of dust, 1cm thick in some parts of the wall decor. The air quality was poor as well so if you have any respiratory concerns (i.e. asthma) this might not be a place to frequent. Even though being full we were seated quite fast. The menu hasn't changed much. In fact, it may not have been cleaned much either as they were sticky and oily. Our server was prompt in asking us if we were ready, we needed more time. My wife and I both ordered hash browns with poached eggs and a pancake on the side. The food came out fairly quick. After having a few bites I noticed there was hardly any flavour. I couldn't taste any seasoning on the potatoes and the Hollandaise sauce had no taste as well. My wife's order also had no flavour (made sense since we both ordered the same, except mine had sausage meat and she had corned beef). I was going to say something but when the server came by to ask how our food was tasting she didn't bother to stay long enough to hear our response. Actually, the rest of the stay was like that. She'd be gone most of the time and then show up to ask us something and then leave without hearing our response. The pancake tasted really good. It was about the only real good thing. It was nice and fluffy and it was huge (considering they charge $4 for one pancake it should be big). I also ordered my toast dry but it came with butter. That as well couldn't be rectified as I waited a good 5 minutes before seeing her again. I decided to just eat the buttered toast instead of waiting any longer. Nellie's Cosmic Cafe is out of this world all right, luckily the breakfast options on 17th ave have vastly improved and I won't have to go here for a long long time.",negative
"One of my favourite breakfast places in town. It's centrally located on 17th, with limited free parking behind the restaurant, so I can easily drive if I'm coming from a distance. Don't come expecting classy or up-scale - expect friendly staff, comforting food, and affordable prices. Check out the specials board on weekdays - there's usually something interesting there. On weekends, the brunch menu has some tasty options.",positive
"You want the truth on this location well here's the real deal. This location its like 1970's all over again but with sass. I been eating here while in town. Myself I have mix feeling about this place. The staff is great super friendly sarcastic condescending and fun all the way around. The food has been inconsistent depending on time of day. One thing I liked it was always tasty. Breakfast food with a ghetto chic appeal, and flavors. This isn't your mom and pop breakfast place. You will go There to be seen or just have a great conversation with your server. This is a quality place to kick back that hangover. The owner super friendly and attentive to its customs. The cooks been there forever. That's what makes this place for me. Happy kitchen staff, happy customers. So I give this place a four star because you can't beat good consistencies when it comes to breakfast. This is the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me. Well you know the rest. :-) Keep up the good food one egg at a time Nellies. You have my business while I'm in town.",positive
"This place is quite the dive but I enjoyed it, cheap food and it was very tasty! Eggs Benny was delicious:) I think the place is cute with the whole place looking like it was all bought from a garage sale but I loved it haha!",positive
"This was spur of the moment, first restaurant I saw, moment. When I sat down and ordered I started to read the yelp reviews and became a little apprehensive. I began to inspect the place: it's old, but was very clean, the service was good - a paper in the morning with breakfast and hot coffee. Seemed like there was quite a few regulars. Food came fast and the hash browns were delicious. I had the California omelette which left much to be desired. Over all it seemed like not a bad place, but I would look for somewhere else to eat the next time I was in the area,",negative
Just came in to grab a quick coffee but decided to stay to enjoy the old-school cafe charm. Got a dessert and some toast (we were saving room for tubby dog) which were all round delicious and the coffee is on point too.,positive
"Terrible! Went there for a breakfast on Saturday morning because Galaxies line up was too long. Waited at Nellies for nearly an hour after I placed my order and then when I finally got it l, my soft poached were completely hard. Sent it back and the. My boyfriends wasn't any good either. Only saving grace was that our waitress was very kind and thoughtful. Definitely wont be returning.",negative
"Nellie's used to be THE place to go for breakfast, but I think the bar has been raised in recent years by the plethora of breakfast-focussed joints that have opened in town. The food is okay, but the rating gets dropped due to the general discombobulation of the service (both hardware and human). Not every table has menus and the various condiments. Last time, I ordered the Ukrainian lunch, but got the Ukrainian breakfast. I'd correct it with the well-intentioned waitress, but was really hungry by the time it came out. If the food came out faster, and you didn't have to wait for a table, it would be decent, but Nellie's needs to work on these things before I'd return.",negative
Was on (the supposed to be) trendy 17th ave in Calgary and stopped in to Nellies for a late breakfast/brunch. At $33 (not including tip) for breakfast for two to be a little steep considering the food was mediocre at best.,negative
"Quite possibly the worst breakfast of my life. Looked cool from the outside, even the inside looked kind of neat. My girlfriend and I each ordered your basic bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast plate. The scrambled eggs came looking a little pale and cooked without any seasoning at all. Bacon tasted a little funky. Half of the browns were raw the other were cold and soggy, there were visual traces seasoning on the browns, but I believe it was just paprika and was clumpy and just nasty. The toast was okay. Oh and all of that came to $30.00.",negative
"My husband and I have been to the Nellies in Kensington and really enjoyed it. This Nellies was something else. The waitress was so rude! My husband asked for a egg dish that comes with hollandaise sauce. She said that they were out of the sauce and that if we wanted it, we should have got here earlier. He ordered another dish and was presented with only a tiny portion of the usual sausage. He asked if this was normal and pointed out that the other Nellies always gives him much more. She said no, she gave him the right amount and the other Nellies was wrong. How could they be wrong about four times in a row? The other food was okay but not worth the trip. This was nothing compared to our Kensington experience. Our friend, a first timer, said she would never go back and neither will we.",negative
"First time at Nellies. Not a good experience at all. Had a salad with what was suppose to be garlic toast, but was a slice of white bread with a little butter. They apologized and brought back another white slide of bread which was suppose to be garlic toast, but smelled bad, nothing like garlic. It was expensive, the floors were very dirty. That was my first time and my last time.",negative
"Nellie's... it's alright. I think the lineup at the door is because of the slow kitchen staff and the fact that some people just haven't branched out to better brunch locations yet (there are better). I was here for brunch today with a couple of friends. It didn't take us TOO long to be seated by a rather surly youth. I'm glad our server was a bright and chipper blond. What Nellie's did right: My coffee... every time I looked down it felt like it had been refilled for me. Awesome! Our service... like I said, our server was bright and chipper and on top of our orders. We were sitting right next to the order window and heard her send back even orders of toast that weren't up to par. Food... once we got it, it was pretty good food. I ordered the morning maple blt. It could've used a bit more bacon, but the maple syrup was a great touch to the blt and my hashbrowns were nice big pieces of potato grilled to a crispy outside and soft inside. What needs work: The time it takes for those food orders to come out. I'm glad there were three of us to keep the chatter going and that we weren't in a hurry. One couple beside us walked out after they had been waiting an hour for their food. Nellie's, pick it up. It's the first time I've been back since the news hype almost two years ago. You're still in business so that part must be a lot better... It'll be another while before I try you again, at least on a Sunday.",negative
"I just get this general dirty feeling from Nellie's... Maybe I've been tainted by the disgusting charges against the breakfast diner, but my dislike for the food started beforehand. Though I know people who have always & will always love Nellie's, I just do not like it. On more than one occasion after breakfast at this restaurant (especially the 17th Ave location), I have felt yucky and sometimes downright awful. It's just too heavy and greasy, the oil tastes heavily recycled and the eggs always have that yucky smell & taste that eggs can occasionally get. The food relies on grease and salt to make it taste good. We make far better breakfasts at home for a fraction of the price.",negative
"I can't understand what's the hype about this place. After reading many good reviews, decided to go there for breakfast. First of all, service was mediocre - had to wait about 15 minutes to order. Waited another good 20 minutes for our food, that wasn't all that great: hash brows were soggy (like they were dipped on water and then served), pancakes weren't cooked long enough (tasted like raw batter) and Maple BLT sandwich was nothing special. STAY AWAY.",negative
"After that news, the last thing I would do is step into a Nellie's again. Maybe this will finally get rid of them, and they can open some decent breakfast places. Disgusting!!!",negative
Great breakfast place...Service is always freindly and attentive when needed...food is usually good with the eggs Bene & Asparugus being a fave of mine..decor is great being nostalgic for me...excellant location for walking after to work it off.,positive
"Okay, upon my return to Calgary (and Yelp) I actually moved within spitting distance of this diner and so despite my dislike of it have been coerced into going on a few occasions but not again. The food has gone downhill even in recent months with eggshell being found in breakfast burritos, hair in huevos, and to add insult to injury they make you wait an appalling amount of time for this awful food. Skip Nellie's and go to Galaxy just a few blocks away, trust me you won't regret it.",negative
"Have you ever craved breakfast for dinner? Do you wake up late some Saturday afternoons and realize you've slept past the breakfast cut-off? Well, worry no longer for Nellie's Cosmic Café will serve you breakfast any time you want! Whether it's actually breakfast time, or closer to supper time, Nellie's serves their customers breakfast all day long. Having many different locations across the city, I find 17th Avenue Nellie's to be my favourite. They have the feel of an old 50's diner, complete with pictures and trinkets dating back 50 or so years. The walls, and even ceiling, are sprinkled with eye-catching objects and great conversational pieces. You'd be hard pressed to sit through an entire meal without talking about, or at least mentioning, some of the charms and gems around the place. My favourite diner-like article in Nellie's Cosmic Café is the individual juke boxes they have placed at each of the booths along the walls. The only disappointing thing about the juke boxes is that they don't only play old 50's music. If you want some Madonna or Guns N' Roses just plug in your 25¢ and enjoy. The staff members aren't necessarily poodle girls or greasers, they don't ride around on roller skates or sing on command, but they are fun and friendly enough just the same. They are quick to refill your coffee and hold no grudges if something needs to be sent back in error. Granted, I've never received anything erroneous from the kitchen, but I've seen others send things back and it's never been a problem. The food selection at Nellie's speaks for itself; breakfast. They have everything from egg's Benny to French toast, and all that comes in between. I wouldn't say that Nellie's serves gourmet breakfast, but it has a home-cooked quality which separates it from the other venues. They also have a small lunch menu, sandwiches, soups, etc., just in case you're not in the mood for breakfast. Crazy, I know, but understandable, I suppose. A popular choice for me is the Ukrainian. It combines breakfast and lunch with your choice of eggs, hash browns, fruit, sausage, and even perogies. Perfect for those days when you just can't decide between the two meals. So if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive afternoon breakfast, Nellie's on 17th should certainly be a top choice. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, and Nellie's Cosmic Café understands this. In fact, it's their motto.",positive
This is a great local restaurant in Avon. Excellent food and even though the prices are high you get what you pay for at this restaurant. I recommend anyone traveling to Avon to give it a try. If you live here in Avon and haven't been to Nemo Grille you should go there ASAP and get some good quality food.,positive
"We were in town on business on a a Sunday, didn't have reservations and the staff was very friendly and squeezed us in. Food was great and a cozy atmosphere.",positive
"Date night dinner destination. The place is small and romantic. I'd recommend making a reservation. Andy still talks about the salmon here, hands down the best he's ever had. I love the dessert menu, they bring a tray with one of each dessert for you to choose. It's very difficult to choose just one! If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it.",positive
"I travel a lot and eat in nice places. Had 6+ dinners at Nemo Grille always great, last week duck was Not over cooked, good presentation and quality. Service excellent.",positive
"Gotta love this place. Recommended via flying service here local airport. Old house converted. My favorite setting. Most wonderful Italian chow and moscato Italian drink. I had a special order pasta with marinara, shrimp and sausage. My normal special request. Was excellent. Kinda short on sausage. Small strips of that only. Shrimp were larger and nice however. I sat in a heated, enclosed porch area. Surprised me that was the warmest room, and comfortable, in the house. I will be back. Perfect service here also.",positive
"We all LOVED it here! Definitely coming back with more loved ones..The service there is impeccable and that's a must for an upper class restaurant in my opinion. Entrees were adventurous and appetizers made me want more! I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, so when there's a gem of a place this close by it's a must to visit every now and then. I had the duck breast with fig sauce and caramelized onion mashed potatoes. More of my other friends played it safe with filet mignon and chimmichura sauce. Another friend had sea scallops which were cooked to perfection!! I'll tell you something some places leave you with the sand in the scallops leaving you and your teeth feeling gritty but not this place def thumbs up!",positive
Food was very good. It was just very loud in the dining area where we sat. Had to yell just to have a casual conversation.,positive
"Not a best kept secret anymore. Gourmet food in a family run neighborhood atmosphere. Can't go wrong with any menu item, especially a filet mignon or sea bass. They didn't make us feel bad for not being dressed up and in fact were very welcoming. Love this place. Go here, do this and tip well!",positive
"Still a 5-star rating! Celebrated my parents birthday at Nemo grill last Sunday. They had never been there and could not have been more pleased. Our waitress on the porch (5:00 reservation)...wish I could remember her name but she has waited on us before is professional, courteous and fun. Between the 4 of us we had the lobster bisque, stuffed pepper soup and ceasar salad to start. Entrees were the veal scalloppini, scallops, duck and lobster fettuccine. I wanted to lick the bowl clean after finished the fettuccine. Everyone was so pleased with their meals and the service. Finished our meals with creme brulee and they brought my parents one of the chocolate desserts, complimentary, for their birthday complete with candles. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Thanks Nemo for making my parents birthday celebration special!",positive
"Food: interesting combinations. Done very well. Service: very good. Very nice and friendly staff Ambience: romantic if inside. Outside: avg. Small place overall. Value: 3/5. Salmon, light potato coupled with dinner salad and 1 glass wine: $55, High.",positive
"Tried Nemo after reading a lot of views on Yelp. It's was good, but not great. We sat on the patio which is cute, but you are staring at traffic, so the view is not special. Prices are on the higher side. Bread and butter was good. Bread was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and served warm. The butter was a bit sweet. Crispy risotto cakes for an appetizer were tasty. 3 cakes. The diver scallops were good, but the accompanying was stellar. NY strip with horseradish Demi glacé was just okay. Mashed potatoes were highlight. Dessert was disappointing for two reasons. First, the bread pudding wasn't that good. It lacked flavor. And then they didn't honor the Yelp checking coupon for free dessert so we ended up paying for it even after telling the waiter about it before ordering.",negative
Wow. Amazing service! They don't stop treating you until you walk out the door. Even filling up our water glasses while we were paying! Can't beat it. Food was yummy! 3 different types of mashed potatoes is way to this girls heart. Can I get an amen?! Not to mention the atmosphere! We sat on the enclosed porch while it was raining and it was beautiful. Everyone go!,positive
"Ordered a filet mignon and hubby got the swordfish- both amazing options, so filling and was laid out on the plate so nicely, something we just had to get on Instagram! Friendly staff- when I complained about how the AC was blowing a bit much on my legs, one of the waitresses rushed over to turn it off and cover it where we were sitting.",positive
"Hands down, favorite restaurant on the west side! My fiancé and I eat here, at least, once a week. I love the comfortable, relaxed atmosphere, yet fine dining approach. I have never had a bad meal or negative experience at this restaurant; in fact, this is the perfect place to dine after a long, stressful day. We typically dine at the bar because we love the ambiance and being able to chat with the bartenders. Our absolute favorite menu item is the Sea Bass; the best sea bass I have ever had. It is melts in your mouth; topped with a magical sauce and finished with Marcona almonds; so decadent, yet perfectly light. The bar burger is the best burger in town! I can guarantee, no matter what you order, you will be blown away. I cannot say enough about Nemo! If you haven't been, please do yourself a favor, and head there tonight!",positive
"Fantastic!!! Wonderful service, fresh crisp salad, yummy creamy mushroom soup with truffle Parmesan croutons, and really delicious salmon over coconut rice and grilled vegetables! The chef is creative, while giving you healthy amazing food!!! We will go back on our next trip. Great food, great service and charming atmosphere. Thank you for an enjoyable evening.",positive
"We went on Sunday (half priced bottles of wine btw) and I got the pork chop special which was out of this world. Tender, cooked to perfection. Regular menu items are awesome but be sure to check Facebook for their weekend specials too. Never disappointed!!",positive
Good food and good service! Loved the free dessert thanks to the Yelp check in! We will totally be back. It'd be nice if the place was a little bigger. It's definitely tight inside and hard to have a conversation without hearing all the others going on around you.,positive
"While I think the bread pudding I had for dessert was fair/good, the grits and shrimp was amazing. I mean I've had shrimp that good before, but the grits were insanely good. Excellent service as well!",positive
"This place truly is a gem. Besides the fantastic service...every waiter or waitress we've ever had is mature, intelligent, and knowledgeable..the food is great! The shrimp and grits are so good I can barely describe them. The hummus is great as well. Fantastic place all around.",positive
"Overpriced good old boys club for baby boomers. The place has a decent menu with daily specials. It took our food 90 minutes from order to table. Larger groups were served before our table of two. Waitress kept covering for kitchen staff with plausible excuses (burned our appetizer and the kitchen ""not talking to us""). For a meal over $100 for two people and no alcohol this is really atrocious. Waitress took off the price of the cheapest entree. Either the kitchen is in trouble or the management is, either way there was nothing special about this place.",negative
"Nemo is one of my favorite places in Clevelands far west side. The patio anytime of year is so charming. The food is always to die for. Service is A+, and half price bottles of wine on Sunday's! It's my annual birthday tradition!",positive
Gluten free friendly and very accommodating:) we have dined here several times and have even done take out as it is close to our house... They prepare a nice meal and we like the ambience as well!,positive
"Bruschetta appetizer was very good. My steak was only warm. My veggies wer cold. My potatoes were so cold they would not melt the seasoned butter on top of them. It was like they just came out of the fridge. The service left much to be desired too. Our waitress showed up only to take our orders, drop off our food and bring the bill. I expected much much more for the price. We wont be going back.",negative
"Enjoyable dining experience with one big other... Wife researched a place close to her parents to have our low key anniversary dinner. We chose to sit at the bar have drinks and apps. Shrimp & Gritts great/Fish Tacos excellent/Lobster Flatbread...OK. After watching the bartender give a free drink(translation the bottom of a bottle of wine)to a lady we were conversing with on the occasion of her birthday and then trying to get the other lady to buy another glass to match it...we were on guard. He berated the handing of the free glass from one to the other, when it was clear the patron was somewhat concerned about driving. We ultimately mentioned our anniversary in the context of the birthday mode, everyone at the bar congratulated us but the bartender. He overtly said he didn't care about anniversaries. Then attempted to pad the bill in the most tacky low class, chain restaurant way with throwing the desert plate in front of us and then suggesting what we would pick. 4 plus stars downgraded or the service.",negative
"Fantastic from start to finish. The environment is slightly cramped, but cozy and romantic enough to make up for it. My group ordered duck, sea bass, and veal which were all delicious. All of our meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors of the garnishes and sides all blended very well. The presentation of all the meals were extravagant as well. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to go on a very nice date or if you just want to have an awesome meal on an average night. The hours are a little different though. They open at 5pm every day, so dinner only. Go check it out!",positive
"Love the food here, totally recommend having a nice romantic dinner, quite and intimate. Service is excellent and everybody is so nice.",positive
"Really good food. The food is a little on the rich side, tho. My palette was overwhelmed fairly quickly. Dine outside if you can because there isn't enough lifting inside.",positive
"Our trip was decent overall. I had the sirloin with blue cheese butter sauce. While a great cut and sauce, it was very undercooked. When ordered medium it was served rare. But still good enough. My wife had the ravioli. It wasn't bad tasting, just not what was expected. The service was nothing short of excellent.",negative
"Favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. Great place to go on a date or just out for a really nice evening. Everything here is good - food, atmosphere, drinks and service. We go here when we really want a good meal and don't mind paying more for it because the food and whole experience is worth it. You don't leave hungry or feeling like you were just ripped off.",positive
"I've never had anything but impeccable service and delicious food from Nemo Grille. This is a diamond in the rough. As previous reviewers have noted, the restaurant is an old home with several rooms. The ambiance is dim and relaxed, and although it seems a bit fancy, many show up in jeans. For appetizers I'd recommend the calamari, the mushroom gnocchi, the lobster bisque, or one of the salads (they usually have a special salad, too, which has always been delicious). My favorite entrees include the Muscovy Duck breast and the filet. I find it hard to steer away from the duck because I enjoy it so much, but I can be swayed by the mac and cheese or a special that sounds delicious. I've only had dessert here once because I'm usually too full, but if they have it available, I would recommend without hesitation the Christmas Brulee. It's a chocolate and Bailey's creme brulee that, if I'd had it at home, I would have licked the dish clean. I would highly recommend Nemo to anyone in the Avon area, or the greater Cleveland area, for that matter. It's worth the drive.",positive
"Service is extremely rude - waitress would not call over a manager when we needed to escalate and complain to someone. I would definitely not recommend this place, specially when there are other much better places in town.",negative
Best AYCE sushi place I've ever tried. Fresh sushi/sashimi and Awesome services. Their servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Their miso soup and green tea ice cream also worth it. Relatively nice washroom as well.,positive
"Looking for a late night meal along bloor and found this gem. Across the street from Green P parking was a plus. Nice decor, great lighting (seriously this would be a great first date spot). As a vegetarian I had TONS of options including appetizers. Food was really good, the tempura could've been a bit more seasoned but soy sauce made up for it. Excellent service as well, and towards midnight as the crowd thinned out, we were offered ice cream on the house (which I accepted, of course). I would definitely return.",positive
Was craving spider roll and came in since a friend reccomended me. I was really satisfied with the spider roll! I ordered a side of sashimi and they were really thick slices that tasted really fresh! The place was very clean and decor bright and new looking. I was very satisfied with my service. The plus was that even though I did not order a meal I still got a soup and salad with it! So glad my friend recommended me and definitely would like to go back! The place was easy to find and at a super convenient location. Signage was big so it was not a problem looking for a place.,positive
"A solid 5 star experience at New Generation Grill Fusion. Came an hour late for my Buddys birthday because parking isn't guaranteed when you arrive in the area. Took an extra 40 mins finding parking plus it was raining, parked 2 blocks down the road and walked up even tho there is a Green P right in front of the joint, thats how it goes. I was actually surprised that they still had my buddy save the seats even tho there was a huge line up when we arrived. The washroom is down the stairs and isn't as sketchy as some other places when you take the stairs down just to wash your hands. Our waitress was on POINT! Performance exceeded any expectations I had about this place. She was fun and smiled and made us all feel very comfortable. THE FOOD! I forgot what it was called on the menu but it was like fried chicken nuggets which were BOMB! the best thing I tasted at any sushi spot, it deserves the 5 star because of the chicken alone, we also got the assorted sushi platter which was delicious but it has cream cheese in one of them which I loved. if your not a fan of cream cheese in the sushi I wouldn't suggest getting it. Everything else I enjoyed and the ice-cream they had ginger ice-cream! lol so its only right that I get that",positive
My all time favourite sushi place in Toronto. Love the spread and always fresh. Extensive menu choices for all you can eat. Try the ribs and don't forget green tea ice cream.,positive
"I love their sushi here, always delicious, one of my favorite AYCE japanese restaurants. Try the salmon and tuna sushi - excellent servings",positive
"Overall, a great AYCE experience. We were walking around the Annex and looking for some good sushi. I saw that Japan Sushi was recommended heavily but was a la carte only and noticed many of the AYCE in the area had a bad rep. Nevertheless, this location proved it wrong and we had a great time minus some bad patrons (see below) Food: 4/5, We order tons and the sashimi was on point along with many of their hot dishes (karage and pork cutlets). Note however that some may be pre-done because when it wasn't too busy around 6-7PM, the food was ok but when it got busy, it appeared that they had to make things fresh so the kitchen food was much better (reco to come near 7-8PM but with reservations). The sushi rolls were smaller in size (all in 8 piece so we were initially worried that we couldn't try a bunch). The only downside would be that many of the special rolls were not available for AYCE and thus making most maki rolls taste similar. Service: 3/5, the waitresses do a really good job despite not no iPad or paper ordering system. You have to tell them what you want. This makes it a little difficult to decide what to order AND because the AYCE menu is just a list without description, it wasn't easy to figure out what was what. There were some bad patrons: two guys sitting beside us obviously ordered way too much and tried to make an excuse that the food was bad so that they weren't charged. The manager came over and said that it was ok and the patrons won't be charged but told them not to keep saying the food was bad because that wasn't the case. I thought this was done professionally. Ambience: 3/5, Just typical seating and quiet overall. Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. Price: 3/5, Typical AYCE pricing; around $35 per person. They should however NOT charge $1 for hot tea.",positive
"Chaotic waiting system. They would rather have empty tables waiting for people who don't show up for 10+ minutes, than seating customers standing in line waiting. Understaffed. Unpredictable wait time, stay away",negative
"Hubby and I were super hungry so we ordered 3 lunch specials: sushi (butterfish and salmon), chicken udon, chicken donburi. All were excellent. The sushi - 4.5 stars. butterfish literally melted in my mouth. the salmon was standard but good. All in all the sushi tasted very fresh. Chicken udon - 4.5 stars. the grilled chicken udon was a blast of flavor Chicken donburi - 4 stars Service was excellent as well as the price. For $30 (3 lunches plus 20% tip) 2 madly hungry people were happily and completely stuffed.",positive
"Loved this place! Despite the fact that the venue is old, the menu was really good. Great selection of sushi. And it was soo delicious! They prepare their own sauces which gives you a chance to rediscover new flavours. Amazing guests services!",positive
"We came for AYCE. They need a dedicated host person for prepping tables and seating people. Once we were seated, the service is impressively speedy for a busy spot. All the servers do a good job and the orders came quickly. The menu has lots of options and the portions are small so you can try different things. There are a decent number of vegetarian options. The quality is standard for the location - good enough, but not great. The rolls do have a lot of rice. The only complaint is that some of our maki were warm.",negative
"Ambiance & aesthetics: The establishment is pretty modern. Maybe play a bit of modern japaneae music to suit the theme of the store, however the entrance to the washrooms might need a retouch Food: Absolutely tasty. Their shrimp butter yaki, their kanikama and deep fried chicken catilage have reached my wildest expectations, all other foods are indeed a delight. People/servers: At first they where slow to find seats for me however once the orders are set they are prompt and very clean. 4.75/5",positive
"I have to say that my partner and I went back and the service has completely changed. There are new waiters who are more quick, friendly and efficient and don't judge us and our big appetites. Big improvement! Now I know there is a good sushi place that is affordable and an overall comfortable atmosphere.",positive
"This place is definitely overrated. The food is mediocre and most of the soup are either very salty or too sweet. Bad: Very thin slices of salmon sashimi- doesn't taste fresh, short ribs are definitely not the best Good: most of the maki rolls. Staff are nice.",negative
"The AYCE sushi was good compared to the other sushi places around town, but was AYCE quality as expected (the fish isn't that great, except salmon). The fried items such as tempura and the fried shrimp was what set New Gen apart from other AYCE sushi places. The service was better than most AYCE sushi places, where they ignore you as time goes on. Would recommend if you are looking for AYCE sushi! but go there a little bit earlier to get seats",positive
This used to be my favorite location for AYCE but I can't help but realize that your servers are immensely slow when it's a full house or almost. I always end up asking for more tea or water or even for the opportunity to order more.,negative
"love love love !! I've only been for lunch (multiple times), but there $6.99 options are so vast. Their rolls are great (I recommend the Tempura and the Spicy Salmon) and another of my favourites is the Udon (amazing), the Bento has great value with the chicken kastu done to perfection. From what I hear the bibambap and some of the other rice dishes are really great too. Service is average but for cheap eats, what can you expect!",positive
"If you want AYCE sushi just for the sake of stuffing yourself with sushi, appetizers, and sashimi: go to New Gen. Boyfriend and I love AYCE more than the average person and we can eat A LOT. After hitting up every AYCE sushi on Bloor, New Gen is definitely our favorite now. We went there on a Saturday night which was a full house. Despite it being busy, we got our orders in a timely manner and the biggest perk was that they never missed a single order from us even though they take orders by jotting it down on a notepad unlike other AYCE! I swear to god we ordered over a hundred pieces of salmon sashimi and they were on point with the thickness and count.",positive
"I was here once with few friends and would be last time. We all had the all-you-can-eat dinner. The food came out look fine but their taste said different stories. We don't expect real sushi in Toronto, but sushi here honestly very low quality, we did not call for second round, just tried to finish our portion. We first came here and did not wanted to waste food so we called not too many at once but little by little to try out, but the staff seemed not so comfortable everytime we asked to order. We finished our meal with green tea gelato perhaps the only thing pleasant.",negative
Food was good Yet service was subpar. Several orders did not go through and this may have been on purpose. Many expensive dishes were not brought. Even when it was brought it took a rather long time.,negative
"I'm a regular at New Generation! The food is good and comes with soup, salad and ice cream on the house! What more could you want? The service is good but the lines are long so you'll probably want to call ahead! I highly recommend the the steak teriyaki (#120). Perfect date spot!",positive
"I never ate here during the Korean Grill days or whatever but I went in when the AYCE sushi started as that is my passion in life. Unfortunately, the owners seem to be crazy and thought it would be acceptable to charge $21 for AYCE during lunch on a weekday so I didn't bother (seriously, lunch is available for $9.99 other places, dinner is available for $16.99 some places, the menu or the service certainly don't set this place apart enough to warrant these prices). I ended up getting a lunch special and a tamago handroll. It was identical to the other New Generation place. Rolls were good, rice was well seasoned, no complaints about the sushi portion of the meal. The salad bothered me, though. It was served with a bug on it. When I brought it to the server's attention she didn't seem very concerned or make any effort to make up for it. I don't know how the kitchen even missed it, it was on top of the salad, not like it was buried in the depths. Besides, isn't that why we wash lettuce? Basically consider this place just a second dining room for when the main location is full, there's nothing to make it special.",negative
"Went there last night as a group of 4 adults. Service was fast and very friendly, the restaurant wasn't very busy as it was after 10:30pm so we were seated right away nice and far from the front door. We had a bento box, some sushi/sashimi and a veggie udon soup. I received an unexpected complimentary green salad and miso soup with my rainbow maki! We were there up until midnight and despite the fact that they were closing and we were the last customers they offered to top up our teas after our meal was finished! How many restaurants do that? The food portions are generous and reasonably priced. The tables have the cooking unit underneath which makes it pretty uncomfortable (and I""m only 5'2"") and the place is a bit cramped overall but everybody enjoyed their meal and we will definitely go again.",positive
"The hubby and I have been going to New Generation (original location aka ""MurderGen"" - on account of the murder and all) for years until the kid came along and now we're yearning for more space but refuse to defect and go to that bastard location Sushi on Bloor - so we checked out this new location aptly now dubbed ""Non-MurderGen"". As far as the food goes, Non-MurderGen is pretty on par with MurderGen, definitely the same sushi menu with some added dishes for the new Korean BBQ menu. And there is definitely space to be had for strollers and such. However what this new location gains in space (and not freezing your ass off in line outside of the original location hoping to God you get a booth and not the bar), it lacks in dish consistency and service. Our miso soups were different. I had the seaweed and the hubs had the tofu...we decided to split half of each others. And we had to ask a few times for chopsticks, which one would believe to be fairly standard at a sushi restaurant. Plus it doesn't have that waiter at this location who remembers who we are and gives us free edamame. No free edamame - no 4th star!!!",negative
They have an amazing grill buffet! It is a great date night idea because it is a lot of fun! The regular menu is also very good. I go here regularly and I have never been disappointed. The bento box is a great and cheap meal. I usually switch the basic sushi that comes with it for the Unagi or Spicy Salmon. The salad dressing is also the best I have ever had at a sushi restaurant! Always an excellent pick!,positive
"This is my favorite sushi restaurant, it has the same great food as New Generation across the street, PLUS Korean grill and the lineup here is always shorter. I've only had their Korean grill food once or twice, but I've had their rainbow rolls and teriyaki chicken (with the thick sauce) many times and always been satisfied. Too bad they don't have a third New Generation out in Mississauga or somewhere closer to me. :(",positive
"Went here for the $5.99 lunch specials. Salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, grilled chicken/beef and some California rolls was ordered. We found the teriyaki sauce too sweet for our palette - our salmon and chicken were swimming in the sauce. Miso soup a bit too watery. Other than that the portions were sufficient, tons of rice, fast service since it wasn't very busy and cheap! Their regular menu also has Korean items. I haven't tried the AYCE grill but for lunch it is only $8.95. Once I went to their other location on the south side of Bloor which had a line up - they sent us to this location with a flyer that said 10% off.",negative
"Finally managed to get our hear for some Korean BBQ last week. It was actually the first time for a lot of us, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I will say that the staff was friendly and the food was delicious. Sadly, most of my dining companions weren't particularly adventurous, so I didn't get the chance to try some of the more interesting items (squid, liver, etc.). There's definitely a good selection of items to suit every palate. Definitely looking forward to a return visit!",positive
"Best Korean Grill in Toronto. Don't miss out stop here if your in the area. Food is great. Atmosphere is super nice and super clean. Staff are all so pleasant. A lot of the girls who work there are pretty cute too! (Bonus) :P Bottom line, go eat there next time your planning Korean food!",positive
"Nine on Nine, the place that makes us say, 'why don't we eat here more often?' every time we visit. Honestly, I think Nine on Nine gets overlooked far too frequently in the downtown restaurant scene. It's been around longer, and perhaps it's not as flashy as some of the newer spots, but their food and wine games are always so very on point, and the service cannot be beat. We most recently stopped in for their New Year's Eve special dinner. Our old NYE standby for the past decade closed down, and we were panicked, trying to find a replacement. Well, we found it, and I am confident that we will return next year as well. Even though the restaurant typically isn't open on Sundays, they prepared an amazing limited menu for NYE. Basically, we read the menu online, thought, 'yes all of those things look GREAT' and made reservations, not really thinking through the 'we are going to have to narrow this stuff down once we're actually at dinner' part of it. Suffice to say, we were quite glad our waiter Ziggy brought us some sparkling rose to enjoy while we spent ages trying to make our selections for the three-course meal. Every bite was perfect, start to finish. The meal started with a flavorful amuse-bouche of pickled beets, candied walnuts, and feta cheese. We also enjoyed some of their super-fresh and soft bread (served with whipped butter with salt crystals on top mmmmm) while waiting for the first course. What I loved about the three-course meal was that the portion sizes were perfect for the first part of a 'night out.' Meaning, definitely enough to be filling, but not enough you felt too stuffed to continue on your evening's adventures, or had to carry a takeout box for the remaining hours of the evening. It was Just Right. We enjoyed shrimp bisque (cold weather Heaven!), lobster mac n cheese (with GIGANTIC chunks of lobster), tender and juicy scallops, a steak that was so tender you hardly needed a knife (yet it had the perfect sear on all sides), and finished the evening off with decadent pear cheesecake and a chocolate cake. YUM. So much care and attention went into each of these dishes and the pairings of the accompaniments on each plate. It's a wonderful dilemma when you have to really concentrate to narrow down the options on even a limited menu, because each looks more amazing than the last. They also have a very well-curated wine list, with lots of by-the-glass options as well as by-the-bottle. They have a great selection of liquors, after-dinner-bevvies, and craft cocktails as well. (I always seem to fall for their chocolate desserts, and they have Angel's Envy Bourbon on hand, which is the best chocolate accompaniment.) During their regular hours, they have a really terrific cheese and charcuterie board. And the servers are always attentive, helpful, and friendly. Prices are reasonable, especially given their location. And if you're coming in before a show, they will do their best to get you in, fed, and out well before the curtain goes up. It's time we moved Nine on Nine from our 'why don't we come here all the time?' spot to our 'I'm glad we go here all the time' spot. I hope you will give it a shot to see if it can be yours, too.",positive
"Nine on Nine has been at the top of my food bucket list since moving to Pittsburgh, and I finally got to check it off last night as I celebrated my birthday! Placed right in the heart of the cultural district on Penn Ave, the setting is perfect. When you walk in, you're greeted by beautiful ambiance (and complimentary coat check -- yes please!) Our server was one of the best I've ever had, and really contributed to the overall experience. He was sure to make me feel special for my birthday and even gave me a free martini (that I didn't order!) on the house. He was knowledgeable about the menu and the chefs. The food. Oh the food. Some of the best I've ever had. We started with a cheese and charcuterie board that was amazing. We then shared the green curry mussels and the lamb lollipops. Everything was cooked to perfection with amazing, unique flavors. Finally, we ended the night with dessert. They have a French Pastry chef in house. We were presented with a tray and thorough explanation of all our options. Almost every dessert featured hazelnut which I wasn't crazy about, but they were still delectable! I wish I could even remember what they were called, but we pointed to the tray and said give me that one! So the pictures will have to do justice. Whether a special occasion or just wanting to treat yourself, this place is an experience I'd never turn down!",positive
Went to the bar called Bar Nine which is part of Nine on Nine. Very nice little bar. They played 90's music throughout the whole night. I date couldn't have been happier. We will definitely be checking this place out again.,positive
"Rosemary here! My gals and I began our night on the town at this quaint little joint where we were treated to some great ambiance. However, my tum tum was in dire need of attention, and there was no bread in sight for quite some time. Right when I began to lose hope, we were served some delicious bread that was as soft as a cloud. My blood sugar dropped to a dangerous level before our Hail Mary came in the form of delicious entrees. My lamb was simply exquisité. But our night was cut short by Hazel needing to scurry home and feed her tabby cat. I'm eager to get another taste of Nine on Nine! Rosemary out.",positive
"I'll start by saying I'm not a regular fine-diner, per se, so my opinion may be due to that factor. My family and I went here for a belated Christmas celebration before a show at the Benedum, which is just a few blocks away. We knew from perusing the menu online that they served mostly small plates, so between the six of us, we shared two appetizers (papas fritas and braised brussels) and all ordered our food with various wines, beers, and martinis. The drink bill alone was quite pricey, but I guess that's expected at a fancier place. I got the blackened salmon and it was quite good, actually. It came with some sort of carrot and sweet potato mash, I think honey was also involved. My fiancée got the beef tip ravioli and to our surprise, it was one large ravioli like we'd never seen before. He also enjoyed it, but it came with nothing but some green garnish and the one big ravioli wasn't what he was expecting. My dad got the scallops and Mexican street corn. The scallops were wrapped in chicken skin and there were just two. They were a decent size so that you had to cut them, and the chicken skin made doing so hard. The street corn was okay but since corn on the cob is typically seasonal, I was surprised they served that in December. He said he could tell it wasn't fresh. My mom got the Amish chicken meal and enjoyed it. My brother and sister-in-law both got the sirloin tornados. They came with two small mounds of mashed potatoes. My sister-in-law liked it well enough but my brother said they were nothing to rave about. He was also done with his entire plate before most of us were even half done, so he was clearly wanting more. In general, I didn't really like not knowing what side, if any, came with the meals. The carrot/sweet potato medley was a surprise and luckily, I like both. My mom's came with asparagus, but none of this is clearly listed on the menu so you don't really know what to expect. When we ordered, the waitress did kind of hint that we should've ordered more food, asking a few separate times if we wanted any other appetizers or side salads. Though I think we all would have liked more food, we knew we weren't going to get much more for another $10 a pop. The final tab was pretty high in comparison to other nice establishments we've gone to for special occasions where we left feeling more satisfied. The wait staff was very nice and accommodating and the place itself had a pleasant atmosphere, though it was a bit dark to see the menu for my parents haha. All in all, we were mostly satisfied with the quality of the food itself but some aspects of the meals were unknown when we ordered and nothing was amazing or even really above average. Its not the kind of place to go in a large group for dinner, in my opinion. Better for a night cap or something along those lines, if you're into that sort of thing.",negative
Worst place ever. Went in for happy hour and the bartender got an attitude when we asked for the happy hour menu. Then he proceeded to make a comment that the happy hour wine I just ordered was subpar. The last thing I want after a long day is to deal with a rude waiter who thinks people ordering from a happy hour menu are not worth his time or general respect. We left and called the manager who basically didn't care about the bartender's lack of professionalism. I'll never go back particularly since there are plenty of other great places to go in Pittsburgh where the service is professional and respectful.,negative
"Wonderful dinner, excellent service. I came to Nine on Nine based on a recommendation from a friend who knows the restaurant scene quite well in Pgh. My sister in law was in town for a training seminar, so I thought I'd treat her. We were both very happy with our meal and drinks. Had a nice rose champagne by the glass, fois gras, bone marrow, good size diver scallops and a pistachio cheesecake for desert, which was to die for in my opinion. We were not disappointed in anyway and would recommended the same dishes to anyone that has similar tastes in food. Give the diver scallops and bone marrow a try (if you're into these foods.) I also hope to return to this restaurant and try a few other dishes, and for sure to have another pistachio cheesecake - hopefully it's still on the menu!",positive
"My company basically took over the entire restaurant for a large Board of Trustees dinner in April, and everything was just delightful. Joe the manager was so accomodationg and nice, and the food was fantastic. I had the miso salmon and it was out of this world, but everyone seemed to enjoy their food and the ambience was lovely too.",positive
"Why didn't anyone tell me to dine at Nine on Nine sooner, rather than later? I feel so stupid! I have been there twice in the past couple of weeks and I have worked not far from this place forever. Somehow, I thought that this place was farther away than it is. Oh, idiot, idiot, idiot! The décor and atmosphere of Nine on Nine reminds me of an intimate spot that you can go to, relax, eat, drink and be very merry! There used to be this show back in the Nineties, called ""New York Undercover"" where one of the main character's father owned a nightclub. Even though, the club was imaginary, somehow Nine on Nine gives me the same vibe, but in a restaurant version. The only thing missing from this place, for me, is a live jazz trio strumming along quietly in the background. Now let's talk about the food and service... Love, love, love the menu! The appetizer and salad menu isn't really that expansive, but what they offer is lovely. Daily Ceviche, soup, roasted chicken and salmon offerings that change based upon what's fresh at the market. On a recent visit, they offered the chicken with a blueberry barbecue sauce and fiddlehead ferns. WHAT??? In Pittsburgh??? Come again? My buddies ordered their home-made cream of mushroom soup and I think that they may have wanted to order seconds. My buddies also ordered the Korean Barbeque Brisket with pickled vegetables, jalapeño peppers, Napa slaw, Sriracha mayo on a baquette. I ordered the Crab Po' Boy with chive aioli, arugula and charred tomatoes served on a baquette. Both sandwiches were served with Nine on Nine's Pomme Frites. I love fresh cut fries and these were scrumpdillyicious, as well as the crabcakes! My buddies also thoroughly enjoyed their brisket sandwiches. (They said that they would order the sandwiches again, but leave off the jalapeños. Those jalapeño peppers kicked their azzes!) On another recent visit, I got the same Crab Po' Boy, but I ordered the Pommes Frites with black truffle aioli. OMG! (Picture Martin Lawrence in the background as his character Sheneneh, saying, ""Oh mah goodneshhh!"") Seriously, my mouth is still watering a little, RIGHT NOW! My lunch partner ordered the Fish Tacos with blackened fish, pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro, cabbage, spice crème and jalapeno peppers. I wish that you could hear the sounds that we were making on both occasions. (Picture Pac Man chewing through things with that sound he makes in the background.) Ridiculous, I know, but sometimes you just have to surrender to your base instincts. I want to go to Nine on Nine for their Chef's Tasting. At $90 per person, it's a little steep for a mom who pays quite a buck for their kid's high school tuition. However, it's a treat that I want to meet sometime this year. ""I die"" for Roasted Bone Marrow and I even have my teenage daughter Muff wrapped up in marrow love. They have Roasted Bone Marrow here too, along with other dishes that I have swooned over in other cities! Who knew and where have I been? Anyway, run and don't walk to Nine on Nine. The staff will treat you with kid gloves and it may be your next home.",positive
"We came in for apps and drink and had a wonderful time. The service was impeccable and the food delicious. The beef sliders were excellently seasoned and surprisingly light on the palette, the pomme frittes were easily some of the best tasting fries we've ever had, and the brussels sprouts fondue was deliciously delicate. Overall our favorite part was Joseph's witty and welcoming demeanor. We'll definitely be back.",positive
"Very disappointed at Nine on Nine. On September 27, 2014, an attentive manager could not make up for the inexperienced server and less than mediocre food served here. We were a party of twenty, with reservations made at least two weeks in advance. We were presented with a modified ""party"" menu that had a cold section (choice of 2 or 3 items), warm section (2-3 items), entrees (I think there were 4-5 choices including salmon, chicken, steak, vegetarian, and something else. Even with this reduced menu, the kitchen staff nor bar staff could not keep up. No one at our table was served any courses at the same time, so we we all eating separately, trying to save the evening by politely picking at the plate when it was set down. Very underwhelmed, and will not return. Ever.",negative
"Came here for happy hour on a Friday after work. Got a seat at the bar and ordered the happy hour special - a $3 domestic beer. The bartender essentially scoffed at my husband and I and told us to expand our horizons and order a seasonal beer ($17 for Southern Tier Pumking). Why offer a happy hour special of it comes with a heavy side of judgment? I know this place is considered upscale, but I could do without the pretentiousness.",negative
"Went in for happy hour. Tacos were excellent. I want to write about the servers at the bar. We had excellent service which made the experience! Very friendly wait staff and very helpful. Had a few drinks. Above average place, but excellent bar tenders. Id recommend to anybody wanting a light bite and a drink or two!",positive
"Walked in here for dinner on a Monday night. The bar had some good happy hour specials (1/2 off bar menu), so decided to do that. Service was kind of slow, considering we were 2 of 6 people in the entire place. Joseph made some pretty good drinks. Check out the sweet and spicy (basically a margarita with muddled jalepeños). Food was average, even at happy hour prices. Tacos, mussels, and lobster Mac were decent, but really lacking any type of wow factor. Don't think I would come here and pay full price for what they have.",negative
"Horribly overpriced. Food was served luke warm and portions were EXTREMELY SMALL. Similar food to Houlihans at triple the price. We were stuck with a fixed menu on valentine's day without warning when made reservations. We should have gotten up and left when initially seated like others next to us did. All the food was served with cream or cheese (forget healthy options at this establishment). I wish I could comment on the full menu, but they didn't give us the option! The decor seemed out of style, loud, and very smokey from the kitchen. Creme Brulee was way too sweet and un-edible. Stick with Eleven or other options downtown.",negative
"About three weeks ago, I had a bad experience at Nine on Nine. It started with inattentive service and culminated with a kitchen that couldn't deliver the proper cook on an expensive piece of meat. Shortly after I posted my first review, I was contacted by the owner and GM, and given an opportunity to try the restaurant again, and that was today. They've changed my mind. The food, service, ambiance, and overall experience was as good as it gets tonight. Our faithful server Ziggy was friendly, knew the menu, had specific recommendations for us, and was there every time we needed something. The ambiance at NoN is upscale, modern, and comfortable. The Brazilian hardwood floor has a unique coloration. The hanging lights are cool. The twenty-one tables seat fifty-six hungry customers. In the current configuration, there is plenty of room and space between the tables for a more intimate feel. They can accommodate up to 75. Now, why we came here: the food. The salads were good, both the Asian Pear salad and Baby Beets salad. The wild mushroom risotto (with white truffle oil) was very good --- and executed perfectly. There was a nice texture and cook on the rice ---- creamy but not mushy. I'm not a fan of truffles, but truffle oil is not usually made with them.[1] I find the truffle fries, ala the Capital Grille, to be disgusting and too strong. The blue crab cream soup I had a few weeks ago at NoN was fantastic. The Lobster mac and cheese was definitely the richest thing we ate, and was as good as the first time. It's rich. I had the Diver Scallops which had a beautiful presentation and was equally tasty. The carrot foam and emulsion were great for great dipping. The homemade sweet potato chips were understated and added a nice texture difference. I wish the sear was stronger and on both sides, but it was fine. The Salmon with roe was good. Overall, our experience this time was much better. I'm glad that the management met my original complaint head on, and didn't try to ""blame the customer"" like we sometimes see happen. It's for that reason that we gave them another opportunity to change our minds. It worked. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle_oil",positive
"Most of these reviews are correct when it comes to service. Our party was actually seated right on time. It was getting someone to actually come to the table which was the first problem. It took over 10 minutes for someone to come and even give us the specials and they didn't even offer to take our drink order. By the time we did order it was 20 minutes into our visit and since we were going to the theatre we were on a time constraint. (We allowed for almost 2 hours.) so the server took our orders and then had to be reminded that we wanted drinks. Service was sub par. Now for the food. Way to pricey for what was served. I will say that my pear salad and my friends carpaccio was fantastic but that's where it ended. Our other salads were heavily dressed. The scallop dish was undercooked and unappealing. The risotto was nothing to write home about and the lobster Mac and cheese was the best of this group. Perfectly cooked, huge portions of meat but the noodles had so much sauce and it was so heavy that I could only eat about half of the portion. Overall I'd say try another restaurant in town. There are plenty to choose from.",negative
"This place needs a complete makeover. It has an old feel to it. It could be really cool, but just doesn't cut it in 2014.",negative
"Some of my work friends and I ordered takeout from the lunch menu. Because it was restaurant week, we just decided to order the restaurant week menu: soup, salad, and 1/2 a sandwich. It was nice of them to accomodate us with our takeout request, so that was much appreciated. I had 1/2 of a turkey club (with real applewood smoked bacon and real, oven roasted turkey on toasty bread), a small garden salad, and the soup of the day, which happened to be cream of mushroom. The salad was on the small side, as in there were only about five pieces of lettuce and two small grape tomatoes, but the dressing was nice and light, and for lunch, this was plenty of food. The sandwich was delicious, even without the mayo. Win! The bread was fresh and lightly toasted, and the sandwich was large for being just 1/2 of a sandwich. My favorite item was the mushroom soup. Super creamy, yet there was enough tang from the mushrooms to cut through the cream. Really delicious. Needless to say, I just had a small sampling of the lunch menu, so I look forward to reviewing the dinner menu soon!",positive
"My family and I had the chef's tasting menu here, which consisted of eight courses. The decor was clean and modern, and the service was very good. It was nice that the executive chef or the pastry chef personally came out to present every dish of the tasting menu to us. Generally, the food was always good and the presentation was nice, though there was some variation in quality between courses. Portion sizes were larger than expected. By the time we were served the meat course, we were all starting to get uncomfortably full. So pace yourself and don't eat too much bread (though the bread assortment is quite good). Comments on the specific courses: - The soup was poured tableside. Tasted like a more refined, less salty and fatty version of a french onion soup. The best part was actually the simplicity of the fresh mushrooms and spring vegetables. - Roasted bone marrow was good, but not great. It wasn't as wonderfully fatty as I wanted it to be. The onion marmalade made the dish for me, adding a much-needed sweetness to balance out everything. - The chef shaved fresh white truffle over the risotto tableside. I really liked this course. The risotto was creamy with a deep parmesan and truffle flavor. It was also cooked perfectly. Only comment is that it was a tad too salty. - The scallops were beautifully seared. I thought that the pea puree was a bit sweet. I actually preferred to eat the scallop by itself. - Palate cleanser featured edible flowers. Very interesting and unique. The bitterness of the flowers were balanced nicely with the sweetness of the foam and the tapioca crumbles. Job well done in terms of successfully cleansing our palates. - Duck was very good and seasoned well. Skin was crispy and the ratio of meat to fat was nice. I loved the beets and quinoa accompaniments as well. - Cheese course: Three different cheeses served with a jam, macadamia nuts, and crisp toast. My favorite was the truffled asiago. - Dessert was indian spiced donuts served with some sort of berry/rose sauce. The donuts were not sweet at all and had a great texture, perfectly fried. It paired nicely with the sweetness of the sauce. I thought that the presentation sort of lacked on this one since they used the same bowl and set-up as that of the soup. So my family and I had a good meal here. There were some interesting combinations of flavors, some that worked for me and some that didn't. But I liked the fact that the chef wasn't afraid to take some risks.",positive
"My experience here was a mixed bag. We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing. For dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon. This was FABULOUS!!! I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10. I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever. The flavors in the dish were awesome. I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente. I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open). We passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley. I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover). Now here's the weird part. When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed). I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing). It just so happened to be my pasta. When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system. Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill. I don't know; must be the accountant in me. The inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so. The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled. Overall though, I was pretty pleased. I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.",positive
"I'd been to this restaurant before for a weekday lunch. After a good experience and some very tasty chicken, I decided to return with some out-of-town friends for dinner. We started off by ordering some appetizers and a bottle of wine. It seemed to take a while for the appetizers to come out, but when they arrived they were very tasty: asparagus salad, mussels, soft shell crab. However, this was when all went downhill. After waiting nearly an hour after our appetizers for our entrees, we noticed that all of the wait staff had disappeared into the kitchen, and that NO ONE in the restaurant had any food at their table. Through a window into the kitchen, I could see the manager was also in the kitchen holding a child, which I did not find appropriate at a fine dining restaurant. There was one frenzied girl scurrying about refilling everyone's water - we asked her to check on our entrees, only for her to never return to our table. When our waiter finally reappeared, my husband couldn't get out more than ""Excuse me -"" before the waiter cut him off by snipping at us ""It's coming!"" and running away. At this point we noticed other patrons getting up and leaving the restaurant, and were literally getting up from our chairs when suddenly everyone's entrees appeared from the kitchen at once. At this point we asked to speak with the manager. When we told him about our disatisfaction with the slow service, he first tried to tell us that their dinner service is intentionally that slow, but later admitted that the service was ""a little slower than usual"" and that he ""didn't know why"". In addition to slow service, our entrees were not up to the standard of the appetizers we had - extremely salty and overcooked squab, raw scallops, cold risotto. After our complaints, the manager offered to pay for desserts, but we told him we'd rather not stay. He then offered a gift certificate for us to return, but we all agreed we had no desire to return. In the end, the restaurant did pick up our entire tab. I give them credit for this, but I feel that given the poor service, the denial, and continuous lack of apologies, it was deserved. Thankfully, there is a good selection of other fine restaurants in Pittsburgh, so I will not have to return to Nine on Nine.",negative
"***The chefs at Nine On Nine did a good job sourcing and cooking proteins (foie gras, squab); while I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations, there is definitely good food here even if it is a little expensive*** Nine On Nine is a fine dining spot located in Downtown Pittsburgh (not too far from PNC Park and apparently near some theaters in the city). The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen. The restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious. Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab. The bread was standard stuff. There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread. The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt. I started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion. The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces. There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor. I thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor. I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist. The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful. For my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs. The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon. I thought the squab was very good. The breast was moist, juicy and tender. It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture. The legs were crispy and good. I liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors. There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish. For dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce. The panna cotta was good. It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it. The fruit was really good. I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided. The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it). The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor. The kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate. It did not have a distinct flavor. It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot. Service was good. My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. Prices were high. Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant). Nine On Nine is a good restaurant. I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab. While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served. I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh. I am not sure what the parking situation is. I think there are a few nearby paid lots.",positive
"High prices for small amounts of food. My mother and I ordered the mussels and the kampachi sashimi for appetizers to split, I had the monkfish for my entree, and my mother had the vegetarian special (couscous salad with tofu scramble on top). We expected with ordering all of those things that we would leave with leftovers but not even close. The bill was $91. It would be one thing if the taste of the food was outstanding but that fell way short also. The mussels were bland and boring, the sashimi was so small in portion size that we were turned off to it from just looking at it, the monkfish was way over salted, and the couscous salad was very bitter from what seemed to be a vinegar-y dressing of some sort. We will not return.",negative
"My go to place when in Pittsburgh had been Eleven. Over time, it has deteriorated with both food and service. I ate at Nine On Nine last week. Food and service were superb. I travel a lot, and have eaten at the best restaurants in many cities and countries. Nine on Nine ranks high among the ""best"". We sat outside, it was lovely.",positive
"I'm going to be all over the place with this review. That will pretty much match the experience I had here. First drink, PERFECTION! I chose the White Grapefruit Cosmopolitan with Absolut Ruby Red, white cranberry juice and lime. Second drink, not so much. Way too much white cranberry juice and not enough Absolut. No one likes a weak drink, lame! Since it was my first time here, I didn't realize that if you sit outside, you're only allowed to order off the bar menu. I like that and I don't. The ""cheap"" side of me likes it because, well, I'm cheap. Cheap here equals $16 compared to $32 for a full menu item. The other part of me thinks if it's a nice night out, why wouldn't I want to dine outside with a full menu. Whatevs, no biggie. My eyes zeroed in on the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese, of course! And for $16 it better be darn good! Totally worth it. The cheese was nice and creamy with big pieces of lobster and bread crumbs on the top. I'd give that 4 stars! We also ordered a mix between a meat, cheese and Charcuterie Platter. So the cheese, solid (how do you mess cheese up?). Sweet pickles, best part of the platter. The meat....straight outta the Giant Eagle deli section. It was a poor mans excuse for prosciutto and bologne. Gross. Don't order! Factor in pretty inconsistent service between our server being there ALL the time to totally disappearing at the end of the meal when we wanted the check and you've got a iffy experience. I'm not throwing in the towel, I would come back and try out the full menu in the dining room. All I would ask for is a complete package...that's not too much to ask for, is it?!",negative
"My biggest problem with my recent experience at Nine on Nine was the service. The host staff was very friendly and accomodating (we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night) but it took no fewer than fifteen minutes to get water and another ten to get a glass of wine. The food was . . . interesting. I chose sweetbreads for my first course. The dish was served with ""celery air"" (I can't make this up), blue cheese, and tomato confit. Once I tasted it, I appreciated what the chef was doing - deconstructed buffalo wings. But the thing was, it tasted *exactly* like buffalo wings. Perhaps I'm missing the point of deconstructed food, but if I wanted wings, I would have gone to a place where I can get 25 of them for five bucks. For my second course, I had a wild boar bolognese, which was truly excellent, and I highly recommend it.",negative
"A-OK. Great internal ambience, wide selection of interesting food, terrific portions that are larger than expected without being too big. I had the Moroccan Tuna, which was impressively plated, and had the most wonderful flavor to it, but just didn't have much going on as a whole; it needed a side dish or second course served simultaneously to not get bored with the same taste over and over again. The tuna itself was good enough to eat raw, but probably was destined to be sliced thinner; the butterknife I had wasn't quite enough to go cross-grain. The other person I ate with had the venison, which was the exact opposite of my dish; at least five distinct flavors on the plate, almost too much going on, but pretty darn awesome nonetheless. This seemed to be the winner on the menu, from what we could tell. Was told we were getting bread, and had to ask for it from another waiter after the first course because it'd been forgotten. They forgot a steak knife with the venison. Overall, service was slowish, although never so slow that it was a problem. The ""French 75"" at the bar was probably the best I've had. For $75ish a person (three courses, one drink) plus another $12 on a drink at the bar waiting for our reservation, it just didn't feel worth going back anytime soon; at that price range, I'm looking for amazing, outstanding, perfect, superb... not just A-OK. I might head back for lunch sooner, as that seems to be reviewed well.",negative
"Tried on a whim while in Pittsburgh for first time. Food was superb--risotto, seared morocan tuna, and chicken--and they had a great wine selection. The ""chocolate"" dessert was delicious...might make me come back to Pittsburgh! Service was excellent. The ambiance was relaxed and to romantic.",positive
"Nine on Nine Your typical upscale bistro style dining experience located in downtown Pittsburgh. Rustic looking faux wood floors, trendy colors on the wall, white table cloths and an eclectic mix of dining patron rounded out the scene. The service was upbeat and professional, without being pompous, the wine list seemed rather sparse but I am comparing it to other large metro areas where they may have more selection, however there were good choices in most categories, although I thought the prices to be a tad high. The menu was varied and we had difficulty choosing, for starters I decided to let y cholesterol be dammed and try the veal Milanese (sweetbreads) - interesting title since it was not Milanese style except for the breading and pan frying of the product. Sweetbreads have a very rich but blandish taste to them so they need an accompany flavor and imho a decent amount of acid to cut through the richness. Nine on Nine performed admirably on inducing flavor and cutting the satiety of the thymus gland. First off the flavor came from the panko breading and the beurre blanc that accompanied the dish, the acid from the capers and small slices of petite grapefruit. A wonderful mix that greatly enhanced the balance and depth of the dish. Good Job We also had the beet salad, that had greens, beets, beans and shaved fennel and a goat cheese poppy dressing. First off all it was NOT drenched in dressing - yeah. Second the combinations of flavors were good and third the beets were al dente - even better. Another smashing success. The third dish we tried was the king trumpet mushrooms served with oriental style with a miso-chili vinaigrette. For entrees we had the hanger steak and scallops. The flat iron steak was served on cheesy grits and had a nice Creole sauce. The dish was good but lack of vegetables seemed or color dulled the dishes presentation, plus if we had not filled up on 3 appetizers (split between 2 people, one a light eater) this dish would have been less then filling. The scallops were served on a base of corn and chorizo (Pittsburgh seems to be in love with chorizo, there didn't seem to be a restaurant we went into that didn't have it as some component on the menu) The presentation was good and we got 4 large sea scallops topped with ramp aioli and cilantro. While the flavor itself was good, it was not ohhhh or awww, good, but nothing really fantastic. For desert I got to choose from a nice selections of port by the glass while my son had the strawberry sorbet, homemade nicely balanced and topped with kiwi. Very light and refreshing and not overly sweet. Bottom Line: Bottom Line: Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 4.5 stars Sweetbread Appetizer: 5 stars Salad: 5 stars Mushroom appetizer 4.5 stars Hanger Steak - 4 stars - needed more color on plate and portion size was a little small Scallop Entrée - 4 stars - Presentation was nice but needed more flavor/ pizzazz Dessert - 4.5 stars 4.6 Stars apps, salad, and dessert were excellent the entrees very good (small deduction because of those), service excellent, atmosphere very nice. I would recommend them, but I would also be in search of a truly stellar dining experience in Pittsburgh.",positive
Go there on your birthday. Free beer with their complete selection yours for the taking. If you can't have fun there that day there is no hope for you.,positive
This restaurant was a quick walk from a training I attended at a nearby hotel. Sports bar atmosphere. Food was quick and sandwiches were good. I had a salmon sandwich. Cheap and filling lunch option.,positive
"The Nitty is a Madison staple, and although it has a college bar feel, it's still a great place to grab a beer and meet friends. The staff I've encountered have all been helpful and friendly - the bar was packed in the middle of a busy ""power hour"" but the bartenders patiently and attentively explained the menu and took our orders. If you're looking for an inexpensive drink, come at 10:00pm for $1 High Life. If you're hungry for food, the burgers are also surprisingly decent.",positive
"Had brunch here yesterday. Wasnt too impressed. Liked that they sourced a lot locally, but the food wasnt anything special. Coffee was awful. Do not get the coffee. Mini donuts were good though!",negative
"So, I'm in my early thirties but am clinging to my late twenties. I'm here from out of town and stroll in at 11:45 on a Wednesday looking for food. The music is late 90s / early 2000's, and the bar is moderately packed with twenty and thirty somethings. I approach the giant bar and pick a spot with great tv and people watching views. The bouncer chases me down and asks for my ID. I chuckle and hand it to him. But, man did that feel good. The bartenders (three) are super attentive. The guy that mainly serves me--Ben--gives me amazing local beer samples based on my stated tastes. Then, he gives me great menu suggestions. While I'm ordering, a guy approaches the bar to order 9 (yes, nine) shots. A girl comes up and tells him a friend of hers ""looooves"" him because the friend likes ""seasoned"" guys. I die laughing. She starts hitting on me. Ben saves me. Whew. I order a Sunrise Burger that basically comes out in seconds. It's amazing, except that the bun is a bit stale. Everything else is delicious. The side of Wisconsin cheddar cheese curds that I ordered based on Ben's recommendation is so amazing that I get a second. I proceed to calculate the number of miles I'll need to run tomorrow to undo this. Totally worth it. So. Good. Someone is singing happy birthday in the most obnoxious way- for the second time. Apparently, this is well known as, ""the birthday place."" Sure. I miss my twenties and now resent my birthdays But, not in this place. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to sing along to the Backstreet Boys...",positive
"I've only had the gritty burger and fries and they're both really good. Their happy hour is at 10p which is kind of annoying that it's late and not something you can partake in after class or work (I mean, you could but you'd be waiting a while). The staff are mostly really nice with a sprinkle of people that look like they hate their jobs. As the other people who have reviewed this place, they are THE birthday place so come here if you want a free drink and balloon.",positive
1st time eating here was yesterday. I had the BBQ beef brisket sandwich with onion rings & both were delicious. Came back today to Oder something else. Hamburger was also delicious. Friendly environment and restaurant was very clean & nice. Highly recommended.,positive
"I have been to the Gritty plenty of times and I always check in, but have never done a review. First of all, let's just say it--great place, great atmosphere, great food This place is crowded at any time of day or night, and while waiting for a table you can watch sports on the tv's, or just hang and have a drink The food has always been great and they are of course known for their great Gritty Sauce. I have always loved their burgers, poppers, and fries, but the other day I had the Rueben Sand. OMG. One of the most deleish things I have ever had. If a crowded fun place with great food is your thing....then you should seek out the Grittty. Don't let the birthday bar thing throw you off. Yes you get a free drink, but this place is way more than just a birthday bar, and it is a two min walk to the Kohl Center!",positive
"Been here a bunch of times. This is the first in which I've kept my wits about me in order to make a review. I would have gone with ""meh"" save for a few key points. We'll start with the not-so-great. Despite the small crowd, it took an awfully long time for a soda, Arnold Palmer, and chocolate milk after we had placed the order. In fact, the cheese curds showed up before the milk. Aside from the slow-end service, our son's chocolate sunday was forgotten and we had to ask another server for to-go boxes and the payment of our bill. The better: Burgers are great. Waffle fries are always a bonus in my book. The cheese curds are fair. And even though we didn't partake, free beer on your birthday is always a plus. Not to mention, seating was immediate while other places in the area could only offer a 30-minute wait. We'll be back, but only for celebrating birthdays or entertaining out-of-town friends before sporting events.",negative
"I am a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison (well over 21 years old), but I am originally from Maryland. Immediately upon entering the Nitty Gritty the bouncer told me ""not tonight"" and asked me to leave the bar. Considering that I am well over 21, it didn't even occur to me that the bouncer thought my ID was fake. So, I asked him why he was asking me to leave. He rolled his eyes at me and asked to see my Wisconsin student ID. I gave him my student ID and he proceeded to put my 100% real, state-issed drivers license in his pocket and asked me to leave. I guess he thought he was being clever, ""If she gives me a Wisconsin student ID then she must be an undergraduate and cannot be as old as her ID indicates. It therefore must be fake!"" I guess he conveniently forgot that UW is a huge university with numerous post-graduate programs. I basically had to pull a huge fit to get my drivers license back so I wouldn't have to go through the huge pain in the butt hassle of calling the police and having them get my ID back for me. This bouncer did not ask for any other forms of ID to verify that my license was real (I had to offer him my credit card and undergraduate student ID myself). He did not bend my ID or do any of the usual tricks to realize that it was not a fake. Instead he was just extremely rude to me and attempted to take away my very real and authentic ID. I am never going back to the Nitty Gritty. They need to hire new bouncers who are intelligent enough to know how to do their job and know the difference between a real ID and a fake ID.",negative
"I went once when I moved my daughter into the dorms and ordered a hamburger that was delicious! Last Friday night I went back and ordered a chicken sandwich and fries, there were hot fries with and tepid ones mixed in. The chicken was dry and barely warm. I think they should be ashamed of what they put in front of me - standards people. I should have sent it back but we were all exhausted and STARVING. McDonald's buttermilk chicken sandwich meal (my elderly Mom loves to go there) has this beat.",negative
"Still waiting for birthday beer. For a bar known for birthdays, we can't seem to get a birthday beer and have been waiting here for atleast 15 minutes in front of the bar with a balloon. Please continue to ignore me.",negative
"As soon as you enter and tell them it's your birthday, you get to pick your balloon and then head to the bar to start your unlimited drinks! Soda of course for those who are underage. I got the sirloin burger with waffle fries. It came on Texas Toast and was honestly such a great burger. I was so full I couldn't finish it. It was probably because of the first mug I finished before the food came out. Great for groups. I saw a lot of families with kids too. I got a tiny sundae at the end with a lit candle. It was adorable. The ambiance is nice. It's very dark inside. In interested to see what it's like during the day. I like how they call all of the names of people who have come in to celebrate their birthdays. They also write your name on the board at the bar! Great service. Great food. I'm going to checking out for lunch some time.",positive
"The only reason you should ever go is for free/cheap drinks. And even I have now gotten to the age where I would rather pay for drinks than put up with the Nitty experience. The service is almost always terrible. Once we were rudely told by a waitress that she ""wasn't allowed to wait on us"" while she was taking orders for the rest of our group and she would have to send another waiter for no apparent reason. He didn't show up for another 40 minutes, and she continued to serve only 80% of our table... Another time, we waited 45 minutes to see a server, then another hour to get food, yet there were 3 serves for 4-5 tables. Not busy by any means. The food is also way overpriced for how average it is, so there's no point in going there to actually eat. The only decent part of the Nitty are the bartenders. They're always really nice and go above and beyond, even when it's totally packed. They must be absolute saints to put up with the power hour crowd.",negative
"Left nitty gritty to get tobacco. Waitress's suggestion. Came back, bouncer wouldn't let me in, despite large open credit card tab. In the process of denying me admittance, bouncer grabbed and held my credit card, and refused to give it back. It was the short white guy on duty 4/4/15... MIKEY . I had to grab my credit card back from him. So odd. Not just insulting, but really inexcusable. Anywhere else in Madison is my suggestion. Literally anywhere. It could be a rat mucus pile... I would recommend it over nitty gritty. Would be friendlier and smell less like skunk. Great waitresses though. Really nice folk. If only the door people weren't crab people. Edit: I have quit tobacco, but still wouldn't recommend nitty gritty unless you are underage and looking to try out your new fake id.",negative
"This place should be avoided. Both the food and service are horrible, and there are much better restaurants in the city of Madison that deserve the business. On my most recent trip to this establishment, my server forgot about our table for about 20 minutes. We sat with our menus open, looking around for her to walk by so that we could flag her down. We finally had to ask a different server to go get her, which is when she finally came to take our order. No apology from her for the delay. When the food came, it was disappointing at best. The Brisket sandwich was made with a horrible type of meat, not sure if could even call it meat. The fries were good, but those are probably from a frozen bag that they pop in the deep fryer. This place is not worth a second chance. Would definitely recommend checking out the other burger restaurants in the city that have both good food and good service.",negative
"I have been going to the nitty gritty since 1998 (and I have the birthday mugs to prove it). Tonight I went back, and got this burger with peppers and onion straws on Texas toast. It was amazing. I also got cheese curds on the side. Here's the deal with why ordering this was so exciting. I have a severe fish allergy. And anything even deep fried in the same oil as fish, I can't touch or I'll get really sick. I asked the bartender if he could check for me. Monday-Thursday they have fish free oil, and even a separate fryer. He let me know that Fridays are the only day they have fried fish and they change the oil every Monday. He also put in a special note about my allergy so they would put my stuff in the non-fish fryer and they would take special care. When I have an allergy attack, it sets in about 15 minutes after I eat the contaminated food. It has been over an hour since I've eaten and I'm feeling great. There aren't many places I can eat fried food in Madison, it's nice to know a place I've been going to for over a decade takes extra care for those with allergies. Thank you nitty gritty, it means the world to me.",positive
"Do you primarily watch MTV and E!? Is your idea of a wild night a few too many beers and appetizers at your local Outback steakhouse or Chili's? Do you enjoy Sysco burgers and watered down cocktails? Well come on down to the Nitty Gritty! Especially if it's your birthday! I was roped into coming to the Nitty Gritty for a girlfriend's birthday. It was her last night in Madison before moving back to Utah, and she was determined to do a ""Madison birthday"" at the Nitty Gritty. It was her big day, so I was ready to do anything. We came in around 8 and were greeted by a buxom girl in her early 20s, with a tan only matched by Chester Cheetah. Once seated, a agitated waiter quickly breezed through the menu and pointed out all of the birthday appropriate shots. I ordered a rum and coke to start, because honestly, how do you mess up a rum and coke? I received a coke and water, with a smack of rum to it. The birthday girl valiantly suggested shots, so we ordered a round of ""absinthe"" based shots that came out with glow sticks in them. Now, I'm not sure why the glow sticks were there, but maybe it was to distract from the fact that these tasted like a drink created to appeal to people who have heard of absinthe or the Green Fairy from Eurotrip, think it's cool, and don't know any better. Without going into more detail on the drinks, it suffices to say they were all diluted. Maybe this is a good tactic for a bar that attracts most of the binge drinking population of UW-Madison, or the newly minted 21 year old that is out to get completely hammered. The one redeeming feature of the bar that night was the shotski - four friends taking a shot from a ski. It was cute. Do you remember burger day in middle school? The patties were uniform, charbroiled, and sat in a pool of brownish water until slapped on a bun into your tray? If you loved those burgers, you'll go nuts for the Nitty Gritty. Douse this sucker in ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, pickles, anything you can, because you're going to need it. Honestly, in a state that prides itself on its dairy and beef, why would you skimp on your burger? There are literally some of the best burgers in Madison to be found within a 3 block radius. Maybe they are hoping that the newly legal clientele still have a nostalgic sweet spot for those old cafeteria burgers (even I liked burger day when I was 13, but it's because it came with an awesome brownie). As for the sides: you can expect an anemic salad with some forlorn croutons, and fries that are probably better than they have to be considering the standard Nitty Gritty fare. Finally, we were lucky enough to be here for POWER HOUR!!!!!!11111 From 10-11 PM they reduce the price of their drinks to their actual value considering the watered down alcohol content. In summation: friends don't let friends celebrate their birthdays at the Nitty Gritty. If you must, stop in for one shotski, a birthday drink, and move on.",negative
"I've been here a couple of times, buts its never my choice and I hesitate to go here. Food - One of the worst values I have ever experienced in a restaurant. It is pretty bad and way over priced. I was ordered an Italian sandwich thing and veggies for 10ish dollars...I got a 4 inch sub and a cup of bag steamed veggies. Seriously? I could get a better/bigger 6 inch sub at subway for 4 dollars. I went here one day during Spring break for the bar. Left in two minutes. The only people in the place were creepy 23-25 year old guys with their guts overflowing and tatted up.",negative
"I will only go back for a friend's birthday, if it's the only venue at which I can join them. Worst. Nachos. Ever. Stale, apparently covered with Velveeta, with black olives sprinkled as an afterthought. Whoever assembled ours didn't know the distinction between jalapenos and peperoncini. The ""homemade salsa"" wasn't even ""Wisconsin spicy"". The burgers are OK, but there are much better venues. Dotty's is half a block away and has much better food. If you must go, rest assured that they have a decent craft beer selection.",negative
"I'm happy to see people consistently rating this 2-3 stars because the food is standard pub food--nothing exceptional. When I had first moved to Madison for some reason we ate here all the time (Current Tally of Birthday mugs: 5). I say the only reason to eat here is for a friends birthday (if they want a mug). Though it isn't a bad place to eat before or after a Badger game though it is pretty busy at those times--I'd more identify this as a classic place to get a beer when you are in your Badger gear, they always have the good/standard Wisconsin Craft Beers. And a happy note for those who have the full collection of colored birthday mugs--They upgraded their birthday mugs to something a little more classy. So come on down!",negative
"Eh, not my favorite. The crowd is a smattering of college kids as well as older folks celebrating their 10th? 11th? 12th? 21st birthday anniversary. It's a strange combination. Drinks are weak during their $1.25 rail drink hour. Seriously, I'd rather pay a few bucks more and get a full-strength beverage. The only thing I found impressive at the bar was how trashed my friends managed to get off of $20 worth of booze.",negative
"Food-1 star. All through out college I tried very hard not to succumb to birthday dinner peer pressure. The gritty sauce is not good & I always leave nitty feeling like a train rammed into me. For a good burger, try dotty. Bar-3.5stars-only worth going during power hour. They raised the prices since I went to college, now a whopping $1.25 for a mixed drink, Madison I think I can afford this ;) the music is always Good but never new top hits, & the place is packed. I would never stay. Here past 11:15, leave & go to another bar! SKIP the FOOD.",negative
"I was pleased with the juicy burgers, big portions and very excellent fried items. I had the BBC burger with mushrooms, mini corn dogs, deep fried curds, waffle fries, regular fries, coleslaw and chicken fingers. I loved it all. The beer selection is great and there are a lot of local beers on tap. Too bad it wasn't my birthday or else I could've gotten free beers all night. It was pretty empty the night I went, but this seems unusual from the other reviews. There's also some outdoor seating. The waitstaff seems to vary quite a bit in terms of competency. We sat down at the same time as the table next to us and they had all their food before we even had silverware or napkins.",positive
"The Nitty Gritty seems to be a popular place to hang out in Madison, but I don't see the charm. I mean it's a typical pub/bar that specializes in celebrating birthdays, but besides the celebrating the birth of ones life there's nothing special about this place. I've been here twice and each time received poor service at the bar. I can't speak for the food or table service, but the food didn't look like anything special. I also think the only reason this place is ever full is because Madison lacks decent bars and people have limited options.",negative
"What's the point? Oh right, free mug and beer. But wouldn't you rather pay money for good beer and have the added bonus of letting your friends enjoy the evening too? Almost tempted to give another star just for the pleasure of seeing two blood-thirsty vegetarians shotgun a cornucopia of game in Deer Hunter.",negative
"Free beer is cool and the prices are right. The burgers are mediocre at best. The bun was stale, they forgot the special sauce and the sides were just ok. Meh. I don't hate it but its certainly not even close to the best burger in town.",negative
"I've gone to the Gritty on my birthday every year since I turned 21. It's become a bit of a tradition that I meet up with my parents and grandmother for lunch or dinner, and this year was no different. I enjoy coming here on my birthday to get my free beer & mug, but other than this and friends' birthdays I can't really say that I would regularly visit. The meals are usually pretty good. I get the Grittyburger every year on my birthday - as others have said, it's not my favorite burger in Madison but it's not a disappointment. This year mine was slightly dry, but this is due to me ordering it done medium well. Regardless, I enjoyed it like always. My parents didn't enjoy their food as much. My mother said the caesar salad was watery, and both she and my father also thought their Spotted Cows tasted a bit off. Even so, we had a great time overall for my birthday. I always feel a bit awkward when the servers come out and sing ""Happy Birthday"" but I suppose if they don't mind I really shouldn't. For the most part the service is great. I've always appreciated the bartenders here in that they're always quick and efficient. The waitstaff are usually very attentive and pleasant, and I can't think of too many unfavorable experiences myself. When I've come for others' birthdays I've had more varied experiences. I generally try something different on the menu. Last time I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich - very good. The appetizers are along the standard line of cheese curds and other fried food, and the spinach dip is pretty good too. However, when I've just met up for drinks it can get a bit boring. The atmosphere can come off a bit forced, and it can get a bit too loud. The birthday song they play is close to the most annoying song ever. It's guaranteed to get stuck in your head for days afterwards. Overall the Gritty is the kind of place that most everyone can agree on, which makes it great for getting people together on a birthday. I would recommend skipping when there's a home game at the Kohl Center, because the Gritty has a truncated Game Day menu like many other places in the vicinity. But on any other night the Gritty serves as a pretty decent place to get your birthday celebration started.",negative
"Not my favorite bar in Madison nor is it my favorite burger in Madison, but the place does have a corner on the birthday market. Hell, it is tradition and it can even be a lot of fun (especially if there is a balloon artist lurking about). They do have a pretty good beer selection (I love when they get in any brew that Capitol only made small batches of) and it can be a good place to spend an afternoon watching sports. Drinks can be a bit costly, but enough people are willing to pay it. It can get a little hectic when there are events at the Kohl Center though and it can be damn near impossible to get a drink on the weekend nights.",negative
"I've been here a couple of times, and it isn't bad, but I really have found nothing great here that can't be found elsewhere in Madison. The burgers are ok, but Amy's and Dotty's both are better at making burgers. The drink selection I remember being decent, but nothing special. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Nitty Gritty.",negative
Great location with excellent service and food. Pizza always is super-tasty at this location. Try the wings. Everything delicious.,positive
Worse customer service ever. I was having issues with the online ordering and after 20 minutes decided to call for my order the rep I spoke to couldn't help me so I asked for a manager to see if they could honor the coupon online and was told no. This manager was completely rude about it. It was a $3 difference and still she wasn't given the authority to honor the online special. Needless to say I ordered from pizza hut with no issues online... Don't order from here go to pizzahut online is so simple,negative
Haven't ordered from here in a very long time. I understand why I haven't. Ordered online at 9pm. After order is placed and my card was ran it says it going to be 85-95 mins. Okay so I tell my family and they said okay see if you can cancel the order. I called at 10:45 asked to cancel my order the guy said no mama it's on it was. Sorry we only had on driver tonight. It will be there shortly. Well about 15 mins later I hear a knock on the door. Pizza is here.....but it's cold and garlic cheese knots were raw in the middle. Horrible!!! Never again,negative
"Ordered delivery, got here only 15 minutes later and was great and totally fresh. The delivery guy whose name I didn't get was also great and made it a positive short experience instead of a very lifeless handing over of boxes. Only negative is on my part as I forgot I used some of my cash earlier in the day - leaving me with only a few bucks to tip with when he definitely deserved at least a couple more than I was able to give him, sorry! Definitely will be getting delivery from this location again.",positive
"This place is full of scam artists. A few weeks ago I ordered pizza from this location. I did it on accident, thinking it was the location closest to my house. When I got the order back to my house, I realize they forgot all of my sauces, but they were all listed on my receipt. I called the store and talked to the manager, who said that because it was an online order, he couldn't do anything to help me this time, but told me he'd notate my account and would credit me for next time. Well, I just called in and talked to the same manager who told me that he didn't see any credits on my account and refused to help me out at all. So I paid in full for a bunch of sauces and then got duped out of a refund for my missing sauces. Not good customer service. Not the Papa way.",negative
"Terrible terrible service. Didn't not say anything when we arrived even though there weren't any other customers in the store. Made us wait for several minutes to be checked out even though our pizza was ready because the employees were talking to each other. They were on their phones and we had to ask for service. Very disappointing service. The first guy who ""helped us"" threw the pizza down and said someone else would help us in a minute. The girl who ""helped"" us after did not greet us at all and just said our total. Will not return.",negative
Dave was very rude to me. I have never been treated like that at any papa johns. I have worked in Pizza fast food before and you don't talk to customers like that. And I've never been charged for a side of banana Peppers before and the way he talked was disrespectful. I will never come to this location ever again!,negative
"****UPDATE**** It has been almost 2.5 hours since I spoke to the manager ""TJ"" about my order and him promising to send out the missing/incorrect items. Now if you read the review below I was suppose to receive the items within 50 minutes per ""TJ"". Order has still not been received, guess his word as a ""manager"" isn't worth much. Suggestion to owners - sounds like someone should have some much needed training on customer service. I ordered online at 4pm to have pizzas and sides delivered at 5:30 pm. 1st of all, delivery was a little late (not a huge deal), driver did not bring plates as requested (again not a huge deal - he apologized for not having them). Then when the pizzas and sides were all opened to start eating, I noticed that we were shorted on the garlic knots AND the cheese cups that were ordered at $0.75 each. So I called and spoke to TJ at this location who told me he was the ""manager"", which I find it a little hard to believe since he basically called me a liar. After a lengthy conversation with him he agreed to send out the garlic knots again and the cheese cups. Delivery time to be 50 minutes. Unacceptable especially considering that the order was placed a good 1.5 hours prior to requested delivery time and it was not my fault that I was shorted on the knots and cheese cups. The manager informed me that not all of his employees had common sense and couldn't perform their jobs accurately at which point I told him that if he was the manager then it was HIS job to make sure that all of the orders went out accurately. Of course at this point he told me that he was being kind enough to replace the items that were missing from my order so what else did I expect him to do. Now if I were the manager of a store like this, first thing I would have done was apologize to the customer, but instead he told me that the driver forgot the cheese cups as this happens all the time and that he knew for a fact that there were 8 garlic knots in the order when he put them into the oven. So he called me a liar and then blamed everything else on the driver. WOW! I would think that whoever owns this location would get a handle on things in his/her store. Bad managers = orders being placed at a different pizza place. If I were in the Papa John's ""family"", I would be ashamed of this ""relative"".",negative
Just received my ice cold pizza took an hour and a half no apologies from the driver told me it just came out of the oven 10 minutes ago I showed him my phone why made the call at 2:41 and he arrived at 4:15 and how the pizza was ice cold still no apologies do yourself a favor don't order from here,negative
Customer service is incredibly rude. Pizza places are everywhere. Certainly don't want to call this one to make me feel like an inconvenience for doing my business with th,negative
I would like to think Papa John's for donating pizzas to feed our troops when we are selling popcorn at Fry's thank you very much.,positive
Umm so we got light sauce or I mean no sauce on our specialty buffalo ranch chicken. There was no sauce....no tomato or ranch just a couple chicken nuggets on a large pizza. My husband called and complained and the 19 year old manager puffed up on him. The kid said he made the pizza and there was sauce. I beg to differ. The manager said I will get a refund. We will see.,negative
One of the favorite spots. They make our vegetable n cheese pizza according to the demand with lot of jalapeño n extra cheese on top. Right on time and excellent customer service. Nice n friendly staff.,positive
Bad service .. Called to place a delivery and i called the wrong location .. They gave me the phone number for the closes store nearest me .. Only they said it so fast that no one could possibly remember .. I ask for it again and they hung up on me .. What a jerk,negative
"*BUYER BEWARE* Worst experience ever! Customer service here is the worst! My credit card was charged 3 times for $17 I ended up paying over $50 for one pizza! To top it all off when the driver arrived she had the completely wrong order! She tried to lay a pizza on me with no cheese! But I called the manager immediately and was told my order was never processed and I was SOL. Somehow my order was never ""ordered"" but they delivered it to me!? Makes no sense. Austin the supposed to be manager was rude and pretty much said there's nothing he can do! Don't worry I called corporate and got my refund and 4 free pizzas! Lucky for the homeless guy on the corner he got my free pizzas because I will never go back!",negative
"Whoever Alaina is should be fired. No beating around the bush here, I tell it like it is. She sucks at her job and has no customer service skills. If you dont know an answer, put the phone on hold and go get one honey. I will never order from here again because of her. Ordered the pizza over 2 and a half hours ago and still no cheese sauce has been delivered because she forgot to tell the driver we ordered it. Good Job Alaina! You just lost your employer business. Hopefully the owner actually reads and follows up on these because we are the ones who pay your bills. Dont forget that.",negative
"Very poor. Ordered 1 pizza at 18:20, email received indicating that the pizza would be delivered in 30 - 40 minutes. At 45 minutes, telephoned the store and was told sorry, internet timing was incorrect, actual wait time would be 45 - 60 mins. Told it's the next pizza to be delivered, should be 5 - 10 mins. At least 15 - 20 mins. later, pizza finally arrived. No apology, nothing. So, from being 30 - 40 mins., pizza actually arrived in 60 - 70 mins. Apparently you're required to award 1 star... which in this case is 1 star too many.",negative
"I drive a little out of my way to go to this location since they are open later for carryout than the Papa John's closest to me. After my first visit to this location I was called and given a free promotion for my next order which was great. Also, the manager TJ is very friendly!",positive
"No complaints here! Papa John's is one chain I can agree with. Their pizza in my experience has always been fresh, delicious, and satisfying. The service at this location was a little slow, probably due to the high volume of orders. It was Customer Appreciation Day after all, which means a large one-topping pizza for 5 bucks! So, the long line was to be expected.",positive
They charge you $0.50 extra for a third sauce. I asked for one line of hot sauce and that was extra! What a rip off!!! They just lost a customer.,negative
Very good Middle Eastern food. Plates are very big and probably it is worth to share. For sure I wanna go back to try different options.,positive
"Worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant. The interior looked dirty and unclean, it took a long amount of time for them to even get our orders, or bring us water. Our food took an hour to come out yet, other people around us already received their food and finished it! Once my food came I did not even receive the meal I ordered, they gave me something different since they ran out of what I wanted and did not even inform me. My friends food looked as if it was sitting out for a long time as well. Not to even mention how below average the food tasted. Would NOT recommend. There are many BETTER options in the food court, that actually taste good and have proper service.",negative
"One star just because some of the food we ordered was good, like the falafel. The worst one was the Zaatar Manakeesh, super dry, hard and cold. Never coming back to this location, the service was terrible! 1- Ordering the food: we told the server that we were going to pay the bill in couples, just to let him know from the beginning to make it easier. And he made a really bad face to that and got our orders really rude. 2- One of the plates didn't come, we asked 2/3 times about and it was always ""coming"". Other tables that came after us were getting their food. After asking once again about the missing dish, it came after everybody else in our table had finished eating. Really disrespectful! 3- We received the bills without even asking for it. Some of us were even going to eat desserts, but it was so rude that we gave up with the desserts. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Ps.: Once I believe that others should not pay for their bad co workers, I'm gonna name our server, because I don't know if the others servers are good or not. The name of our server was Dimitri.",negative
"Came here with kids. Everyone else has received hot pitas and deeps, even those who arrived much later. No water either. I think the servers are nazi, and unless you look like the Mediterranean, forget about good service.",negative
"I was there early at Yorkdale to pick up my moms new phone and do a few things as well. We were both hungry and went up to the food court. We originally were looking for Tim Horton's but came across this place instead. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. Plus thing is if you are really hungry there's two sizes available. You can do the small or large depending on how hungry you are. I went with the small which was really filling, the shawarma tasted amazing! I haven't had that good of a shawarma in a very long time. They do put like chips in a sense in your shawarma which make the wrap taste even better. The employees are very friendly, with great customer service. The line wasn't too long, but was moving quickly. I would definitely come back to try more things on the menu.",positive
I was here for lunch with a friend. The take out line was long so we decided to just sit and dine inside the restaurant. It took forever for someone to take our orders and for our food to come. The food itself was mediocre. There were barely any servers/waitresses in sight so we had a hard time getting someone's attention when we needed things. I was annoyed that we had to spend such a long time in that restaurant because that time could have been spent actually shopping in the mall.,negative
The food is not bad relate to price. The bread is very good and you can have as many as you want. Will come back for next York sale visit.,positive
"The food here is good. However, I find the shawarma to be a little dry. The falafel is tasty however and The staff are nice.",negative
Excellent Middle Eastern cuisine. Ordered their speciality Beef plates and Beef Wrap. Highly recommend it. Will definitely return next time.,positive
Extremely slow and painful Sevice. Not like other paramount restaurants across GTA. The food took a long time to come and fries seemed to be from yesterday. This place seems to be more focused on takeaway than the restaurant.,negative
"I enjoyed the tabbuleh salad very much. The waiter was kind and helpful. I liked the decorations of the place. The only thing I didn't enjoy was music, but it wasn't too loud, so not a big deal.",positive
Came here for lunch and I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered a falafel plate and the waiter mentioned it didn't have rice. Just falafel and salad which was $10 which I thought was not cool. Most places charge that for rice and salad and the falafel. Also the quality of the food was not so great. I wouldn't come back for sure.,negative
About as authentic as KFC is to Southern Cooking. The Shawarma is dry due to being pre cut so early in the day. Bland and tasteless. Also had to return it for more toasting. The press was barely on. Left it on for quite a well and still wasn't long enough. Service was non existent and had to yell for someone to attend the counter. Everyone commenting about this place is right. It's not good.,negative
"I would like to start off by saying that I have never written a review before this one, I have used yelp many times to decide where to eat, but I have never been moved to write a review of my own. My awful experience at this location has prompted me to signup for a Yelp account just so I can share it. I have been to many Paramount locations, and I really like their food and service, generally speaking. My experience at other locations has always been good. That's why when they first opened this location I was so excited because it was close to my house. The first time we went there I was not impressed by the food or the service, but I figured they had just opened and they still needed to iron out the problems. I decided to give it another shot and went there yesterday with my family. The service was mediocre and the food was awful. To make it short, we were given cold bread to start, the waitresses kept coming to our table with other people's orders, and the food was horrible and cold. I personally ordered the Mujadara and a skewer of Shish Tawouk and started feeling sick since the moment I left. It has now been OVER 24 HOURS and IM STILL SO SICK. I have not eaten anything since my meal there yesterday. It's unfortunate because this location has a lot of potential but they need better staff and better food. I will gladly drive further to a eat at a different location.",negative
"This place is very mediocre. The service is slow and after eating a lot of time middle easter food, I think that I'm very disappointed with the quality and the flavor of this dishes. The meat of the shawarma was dry and flavorless and the falafel hasn't all the traditional ingredientes. Just falafel and lettuce. It is overpriced. it isn't worth it. My best advice is to skip this awful place.",negative
For most new places I always like to go back a few times before making up my mind. At first the layout and design of this location was nice and the staff was friendly. I have now eaten in once and taken out a few times. And my view of this place is that it's not going to last for long. The quality of food dose not compare to other locations. I order the same thing at every Paramount and only here is there so much oil you feel sick after eating it. I think they need to rethink their business plan and re train staff on food preparation.,negative
"In all honestly, this is probably my fault. I ordered a tabbouleh salad and once I realised that the staff member couldn't even find it and spent minutes finding someone to help him locate it, I should have walked away from ordering it. Service was extremely slow and inefficient, the portion size was small, and it was very mediocre. If you enjoy eating gritty little bits in your $9 dollar small sized salad, you should check this place out.",negative
"the chicken shawarma was dried out and tasted like it may be from the day before. the kofta was very dry as well...very disappointed, the best part was the pizza I ordered for my daughter...won't be eating here again. $40.00 wasted... next time showtime bistro for me!",negative
"Kind of sad pasta fresh has closed but I definitely saw it coming. Once the owner stopped coming in and cooking the food himself, it all went to crap. The last time I ate here Chef Wes the owner was off and the cooks that we're working took no pride in their work, the food was cold and the flavor was way off.",negative
"I have actually been twice now and been pleased both times. This place is very casual and relaxed. Great spot for kids and families. As the name states, the pasta is indeed fresh! Delightfully chewy. Both the carbonara and the bolognese were delicious. We were also quite pleased with the apple salad and garlic knots. They offer a lunch special with pasta and salad for around $12 - it's enough for 2 meals. I also sampled the braised kale with apple compote. A healthy low carb and unique dish. The menu boasts lots of gluten free copies. They offer all of the pastas whole wheat too. Nice! They were out if macaroons on both of my visits. The menu posted on the wall isn't applicable anymore. There does seem to be a little bit of a disconnect and some growing pains. You can sit and be served. There is also a counter/window to order to go. Regardless, food was good and prices are fair. I'll go back. Very good pasta you can enjoy in your yoga pants with your antsy toddler. A win!",positive
"We had a groupon so we got a good deal. However without the groupon our bill would have been close to $50, which is crazy for a place like this. Food was good, we got the arugula salad which was amazing! I got the chicken fettuccini, flavor was great but the noodles were hard, very over cooked. The boyfriend got the spicy mariana with shrimp, it was delicious! If it weren't for the high prices we would be regulars.",positive
"Yummy yummy. So many choices. My girlfriend and I tried the family groupon. Came with salad, garlic knots and a large pasta bowl. Beginning to end the food was great. The service needs some work. Small place so service looked bored. Will try take out to see if food is still good.",positive
"I have to say I am impressed with this place. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and they weren't busy at all. You walk in and order at the counter. Since I had a Groupon, I opted for the family pasta meal, which included any pasta of your choice with choice of sauce, two toppings and cheese. We opted for the ravioli with broccoli, tomato and ricotta with marinara sauce. The meal also included house salad and garlic knots. Our salad came out first and it was amazing. This was the highlight of the meal. It was really nicely plated and at first we couldn't tell what the ingredients were as an apple ribbon was wrapped around the arugula. The dressing was very light and incredibly flavorful, all the flavors worked very well together and the portion was incredibly generous. I have never been so impressed with a basic house salad before. The garlic knots arrived very soon after our salad and they paired nicely. Warm and fresh, these were delightful. The ravioli arrived last and was really nice. Not as cheesy as I'm used to in a ravioli, but I liked that they were stuffed with so much fresh spinach. Their menu is quite extensive and there were quite a number of other menu items that caught my eye for my next visit. Looking forward to trying more of their food soon.",positive
"First visit last night,I really wanted to love it .I didn't love it, actually I thought it was awful and sent back the entire dish. Staff was adequate,didnt really seem to care that we sent back two pasta dishes with one bite taken out of each. I ordered pesto with broccoli and mushrooms,the dish came out with what I can only describe as a thick dark coating,it was way to thick to be called a sauce and certainly didn't taste like pesto. I wont be going back.",negative
"Our third visit and, because we want this local restaurant to do well, I must offer some constructive criticism. First visit, very tasty food, prepared by Chef Wes. Second visit, still no complaints. Last night, very disappointed. My husband ordered shrimp tagliatelle with alfredo sauce. True alfredo contains nothing but butter, cream and cheese. This alfredo was like wallpaper paste. I'm guessing they must thicken it with flour in a poor attempt at a roux. Very gluey and raw tasting. Suggestion, cook the roux a bit longer before adding milk, then add some cream. I ordered tagliatelle with olive oil, roasted garlic, broccoli and mushrooms. When I got the dish, the veggies had burned and the taste was awful. The chef graciously apologized and made another. Very mediocre at best. This was dry and the veggies had been heated in a fry pan. I suggest they heat in some chicken broth before adding to a pasta dish. I also suggest that when olive oil is chosen as the sauce, perhaps saute the garlic in the oil ""aglia olia"" then add rest of ingredients. I read some poor reviews on the garlic knots. Ours were very flavorful with oil garlic and salt, but the insides were a bit raw. I noticed that they use culinary students in the kitchen, perhaps for prepping? Marinara sauce has good potential. Just a bit on the sweet side. I think the best bet for sauce is their tasty pesto. The ordering area is a bit confusing. There is a small blackboard on the wall, but the script writing is so tiny, it's almost impossible to read. Suggestion: Put a large blackboard on the back wall, near soda, and write in large print so people can see it when they come in. I did see on the board Lasagna $18.00. No way, that's the price in a fine dining restaurant. The chef who prepared our first meal wasn't there last night. The other chef is such a nice young man and, as I said, we want him to do well. Still no beer and wine, and the macaroons are still tiny. Most positive asset, the freshly made pasta is light and delicious. Not trying to be mean, just constructive. I think when this little place ""gets the kinks out"" they'll do well! Reviewed by retired cooking teacher/caterer (of Italian descent)",negative
"I've been here twice already and the food is great ! Between school and work I need a quick bite to eat and I get the lunch special. Great deal, $6.99 for chose your own pasta, bread, & soup or salad. I love that they have whole wheat pasta as an option ! Definitely try it if you haven't yet, they have something for everyone !",positive
"Got here around 8pm on Wednesday after a pretty hard workout and I was dying for a good sized pasta and I was not disappointed! I ordered Tagialelle with carbonara pecorino cheese, spinach, mushroom, roasted garlic and chicken and everything was on point! I'll be back often so stand by for more pasta photos and reviews.",positive
"This place has so much to offer! My boyfriend and I go here at least every other week. Everything is fresh, delicious, and you can taste the difference! The lunch special is super affordable and comes with bread and soup or salad. The staff is very friendly and always makes an extra effort to talk to us and cater to us. Come here for the shrimp Alfredo and I'm sure you'll come back for more!",positive
"I'm constantly on the lookout for the next great local establishment, especially conveniently located places that we will patronize regularly. A bit hidden off the beaten path, this discovery was purely serendipitous. Even better, I found they had a Groupon deal: $19 for their family meal combo (normally $35). We decided to select the pappardelle pasta with marinara sauce and ricotta cheese, zucchini, and mushroom toppings. The combo comes with an order of garlic knots and a large house salad. While you are waiting for your order, you can watch them make the pasta. After about 10-15 minutes our salad and garlic knots arrived. The garlic knots were tasty balls of doughy garlicky goodness served with a side of marinara sauce. The salad was massive and consisted of arugula, radish slices, apple slices, candied walnuts, pecorino, and honey vinaigrette. Although I'm generally not a huge fan of the bitterness of arugula, all in all it was enjoyable. After another 10 minutes, our main course arrived. Although the pappardelle was somewhat thicker than expected, it was tasty and fresh nonetheless. Once you've had great freshly made pasta, it's hard to go back to the dry variety. They also have specials like beef stroganoff ($11), pork adobo with mustard spaetzle ($12), and caesar salad with anchovies that we look forward to trying on a future visit. As advertised, this is fresh gourmet food at a reasonable price. We were impressed and if you look at our star rating distribution, that doesn't happen too often. We will definitely return.",positive
"Great food! Great service! I have to say it is really rare to find a place here in Vegas that makes fresh pasta from all fresh ingredients. We had the papperdelle carbonara and the bow tie pesto. Both were truly excellent. The price is good for the size of the pasta. This place has a great environment and nice seating. I'm always a little skeptical when I see build your own type places, but this pasta was really first rate. We will definitely be back. Now go get your own delicious pasta.",positive
"We tried Pasta Fresh for the first time this week. Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating however the food was less than sub-standard. Our build your own pasta was ordered with olive, chicken and a few toppings. It appeared as if they forgot to add the olive oil because the pasta was dry and rubbery. It was difficult to find anything that resembled chicken and the vegetables were scarce and what we did find were tasteless. Our salad was bland and dry as well. It is not likely that we will return.",negative
I've dined here 3 times & the food is wonderful! I love the roasted pork on the secret or paleo menu it's amazing. The pasta is extremely good as well my husband ordered the classic and loved it. I definitely recommend giving it a try!,positive
"Thoroughly enjoyed my pan-seared scallops with spicy truffle cauliflower mash and wild mushrooms. The flavors worked perfectly together and created what, although ridiculous sounding, resembled something like a taste bud symphony. Tasted a bit of the other dishes my family ordered, and all were just as flavorful. The garlic knots are really good too, not overly garlicky and tasted homemade. The Korean tempura cauliflower is a must. The owner/chef stopped by the table to say hi, which was pretty cool. His passion for good, fusion food was contagious.",positive
"So I went in and had no idea what to expect. The concept (fresh made pasta made from scratch- as you order) had me concerned about how expensive it could be and how long I'd have to wait. I went on the insistence of my GF and can't tell you how happy I was to have listened to her. The food is beyond reasonably priced, I would've gladly paid double for the amazing stuffed pasta in marinara I received. The quickness and efficiency of the staff was unparalleled; I've had to wait at other ""fast-food"" places longer and the food was so amazingly fresh- I joked with my gf that they created there own food establishment category: Fresh food fast. Other establishments should be jealous, haha. If you are looking for super healthy their ""secret"" Paleo menu was what my GF ordered and we split our orders and I Loved the chicken cacciatore as well. Great job!! Anyone that goes is getting a culinary treat!",positive
"I like the concept of made to order pasta, similar to other fast casual concepts out there, but they make their own pasta from scratch here. The place just needs more refinement. My first visit I got the food to go. The House Salad ($8) was already dressed so by the time I got home it was a wet soggy mess. My wife took a single bite and tossed it -- it was that bad. Having the dressing on the side would be a huge improvement, but I don't think my wife cared for the taste of it anyway. I opted for their special -- a roasted pork loin ($9) with a butternut squash puree, sauteed vegetables, ginger crumbs and scallion-ginger aioli. The pork was a little dried out but the flavors were good. On a second visit I tried The Pesto ($10) -- rigatoni pasta with pesto, olives, garlic, tomatoes, pecorino and topped with steak (for an additional $1.75). The portion size was great, and the house-made pesto sauce was good although there was way too much of it. The pasta seemed too thick and gummy. Its locally owned, so I'd be happy to give them another shot, but they do need to step up their game.",negative
This place is AMAZING!! I literally live on the whole other side of town and am here a few times a week. The food is on point. Everything I have ordered is delish and I am a very picky eater! A big plus for me is how clean the kitchen and dining room always are especially when it comes to them cooking my food! My kids also love that you can see them make everything and they watch the whole time. I will def be back numerous times!,positive
"This place is clean, staff is welcoming, but I honestly was very disappointed and still scratching my head at how this place has 5 stars. We came on a Friday night, hoping to get a quick meal in before my boyfriend's basketball game. He had the spinach/cheese stuffed ravioli and I had an alfredo dish. The pasta was cooked very poorly and was very clumpy, it seemed like we could have made better at home. The alfredo seemed very oily, the bacon I had added to it was sparse and lacked flavor, and the ravioli was unappetizing. We also had an order of garlic knots that they forgot about, but once we did get them, they were underwhelming and both the sauce and the bread lacked a lot of flavor. My fiance is normally a garbage disposal when it comes to leftovers, but after packing up most of our food and taking it to-go, we ended up throwing it away the next day. I think this place is still working out some kinks (i.e. the cashier seemed to forget to give a lot of tables their utensils, which the runner had to end up doing). I do appreciate that they make their pasta fresh and they have fresh herbs growing in-house, but nothing about our experience made us want to go back. It looks like the place has a lot of fans though and I'm sure will continue to thrive and improve. Great concept, but I think I will be sticking to Custom Built Pizza when it comes to my customizable Italian food needs.",negative
This place was amazing! Everyhing was fresh and made to order. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. I'm defintely going back!,positive
"We love this place. Very clean, excellent customer service and most importantly, the food is amazing. They make their own delicious pasta, cheese and sauces, all of their ingredients are fresh (hence the name of the place) and the macaroons are to die for. We will definitely be back.",positive
"I decided to check out this place since I noticed it popped up on my near-by restaurants just recently. Apparently this place has been open for 6 weeks now. This place might be a bit hard to find if youre not in this plaza a lot. It's right across the Chuck E Cheese to the corner a bit. When I first walked in, it seriously felt like a sauna! That's probably because they have an open kitchen with all the gadgets going off. It's a very clean restaurant with nice decor. This place could definitely be a romantic spot and also a family spot. They have meals for two and family meals. I got the Rigatoni Alfredo with chicken, mushrooms, and parmesan. I wished they'd give you at least 1 topping for free. They charge you for everything, which is a downside for me. I loooved that the chicken was hand-shredded rather than cut with a knife, like plenty of other places. I also got the garlic knots which tasted a bit off to me.. I just know i won't be ordering them again since they're crusty and too over-seasoned. Yelp also gives you a free macaron and i got the caramel apple. It was sooo good! That was probably the best part of the meal for me. I'm a regular at Mac Shack and this place will most likely replace it!",positive
"My favorite new place in vegas...affordable, amazing quality, fresh ingredients, consistant and always friendly similar to that of a neighborhood restaurant that offers true effort in caring for their customers....I give it two thumbs up and will ve frequenting this lication regularly.",positive
"We were welcomed right away. The staff here is amazing. The customer service is 5 star. I wanted to really enjoy the food. Sadly I did not. I tried the rigatoni with Marina sauce. When it comes to sauce I am beyond picky. A sauce snob if you will. I grew with sauce, or gravy. This sauce tasted like pizza sauce. Not sauce meant for pasta. I could not eat most of the meal. The rigatoni was fresh, however a little to al dente. My husband had the tagliatelle with pesto. He enjoyed his meal. Although I felt his pasta was too clumped together. The dough of the garlic knots had no flavor. I like the concept, the place is very clean, nicely decorated. The prices very affordable. I would be hesitant to try again.",negative
"Thank you Chef Wes, Tyler, Nicole and Heather!! Very yummy dishes. Oooooh boy!!!!! Chef Wes is superb. He made something very yummy for a special birthday. Pasta Fresh is a fast food place, but unlike any other! Their concept is extreme freshness with their ingredients, they have green house-like herb cabinetry with mini basil growing! There is no way that this fast food restaurant takes any kind of shortcuts. NO grease, NO mess, NO guilt. Extremely pleasurable and like other reviewers your pasta is made from scratch and prepared before you that you can see with the clear glass kitchen. Another great independent business with my 100% support! I almost forgot the atmosphere is gorgeous. You must dine here! :)",positive
Great place! Nice and clean! Quick and fresh Italian food!! Love the pesto I ordered! You could see the chefs in action as they cook and stir your food to the right flavorful taste!!,positive
"absolutely amazing. my husband and i love this place. you can watch the pasta being made, which is awesome! its so good! everything is so fresh. i love the house salad and the thai salad. i am a huge fan of thai anything and the salad is delicious. perfect portions of food as well. please dont forget to try the macaroons. they are decadent! 100 percent 5 stars in my book!",positive
"Wow this place was amazing! Three words: FRESH PASTA and MACARONS!! My boyfriend and I decided to drop in as we are looking for more local restaurants. We were very pleasantly surprised. First off they make fresh pasta!! I was so excited as not many places actually do. Their menu is straight forward (and yes similar to Mac Shack but infinitely better). We got the House Salad (arugula, radish, shaved apple, candied walnuts, pecorino (cheese), and honey vinaigrette) and Meal for Two which is 2 build your own pasta bowls with two toppings and garlic knots or macarons. We chose the garlic knots (which are fresh baked in front of you and delicious). The house salad was perfect. Great presentation and the right balance of sweet with the apples and honey vinaigrette and spicy of the arugula. We cleaned our plate in seconds. The pasta dishes also had great presentation with great taste. Good ingredients and good ratio of pasta to sauce and ingredients. We also ended up trying the Pumpkin macarons. Wow they were incredible! Amazing texture and taste. This is dangerous to have so close, I will have to watch my waistline! Overall Pasta Fresh way exceeded my expectations. The staff was super friendly and the service was great. I will be adding this place to our regular rotation and recommending it to all my friends!",positive
"I'll get this out of the way first. I did not love the carbonara sauce. It just wasn't the creamy carbonara I was expecting. But after evaluating the quality of the meal overall, I'm happy to give up the five stars. Pasta Fresh is aptly named. Their open kitchen design allows you to watch everything that goes on and you can see the owner and chef rolling your pasta, well, fresh. The basis of their menu appears to be the build-your-own pasta deal. Pick your pasta, a sauce, a cheese, and your toppings. For my first time, I decided to go that route. You don't see pappardelle on menus too often, so I went with that along with the carbonara (sauce), bocconcini (cheese), and spinach and roasted garlic (toppings). The pappardelle was incredible. It definitely made a difference that it was made fresh. In a way, having a lighter sauce helped me fully appreciate the delicate nature of the pasta. I also tried my friends' dishes. One had spinach ravioli in marinara sauce with zucchini and mushrooms. The other had rigatoni in pesto sauce. Both were tasty, but I especially enjoyed the marinara sauce. I ended up getting some pappardelle with marinara sauce to go for the girlfriend. With fresh pasta and fresh ingredients, you get a gourmet meal at reasonable prices. A good deal is the meal for two. For $19.99, you get two build-your-own pasta bowls and a choice of macarons or garlic knots. We got to try both and they get the thumbs up from me. As someone who doesn't even like macarons, it says a lot that I loved their salted caramel. EDIT: Now that I've gobbled up my leftovers from last night (the word pappardelle comes from pappare which means to gobble up), Pasta Fresh most definitely deserves five stars. I'm still reeling from the absolute deliciousness.",positive
"Great ambiance and a wonderful option for a large party with a beautiful back room. Fresh herbs grown AT the restaurant!!! Ask what's on the secret menu as it includes some special features, AND, don't forget to get a French macaron for dessert before you leave ;).",positive
"This is why I have stopped eating Chinese food and become a Vietnamese food addict... I have eaten here at least 15 times since they've re-opened and have become quite friendly with Sarah and Bill, the English names of the owners. Bill is a master chef and I am starting to understand why I like Vietnamese cuisine now where before, I just knew that I liked it better than Chinese. First off...the Pho. They really don't serve any seafood pho and I've come to realize by eating at other Vietnamese places that even though I love shrimp, it tends to make a rather flavorless pho and if you used a beef or a chicken base, it would overpower the seafood. So beef pho just makes sense. Their pho is terrific. I found it more useful to get one of the more standard pho rather than the 'spicy' and spice it myself. The thing I've learned is to taste the pho broth before I hit it with any of the toss-ins or sriracha. They seem to sell a lot of pho ga (chicken soup), but I haven't tried that...it would be hard for them to beat my mom's authentic penicillin. I will point out that their Sour Shrimp soup was fantastic but it's not a pho. Next - their bun...It's rather simple and plain - noodles with meat of choice (or shrimp/shrimp paste), optional peanuts and egg rolls, accompanied by the sweet fish sauce. The trick I learned here is that you put the chilies and/or sriracha and/or hoisin sauce into the fish sauce and mix it up and then dump it over the bun and toss it all with the fork and spoon. Without sriracha or chilis, bun is something any child would love. This is the absolute safe choice for anyone eating Vietnamese for the first time. Next - their broken rice...Again, it's rather simple and plain - meat of choice accompanied by rice, sliced pickled carrots and green papaya and surprises not on the menu, an egg, mushroom quiche type concoction that is called xeo (not clear on the spelling here) and some thinly sliced salt pork. The first time I got this, I just consumed and the second time, I started asking about the things I was eating. Clearly there is some genius here. Again, the trick here is to mix the chilis and/or sriracha into the fish sauce so you can distribute it more evenly throughout. There are a wide array of flavors, all very delicate and much more enthusing than any sauce drenched Chinese offering. Each time I order a broken rice dish, Sarah tries to substitute the barbecue pork which I absolutely love but it defeats my intent to try something different each time. I have since discovered that Bill makes vietnamese pancakes (quite tasty) and ox-tail pho (probably too fatty for my tastes). The pancakes are easily the most messy things to try to eat wrapped in a lettuce leaf with cilantro and dripping fish sauce. Utensils clearly don't work here. Here's a tip...sit close to the table and don't wear a new clean shirt. On the plus side, none of it is greasy so it won't permanently stain but between pho noodles, bun noodles, drippy pancakes, it's hard not to leave soiled and happy.",positive
"I've been waiting for Pho Loc to reopen after their roof collapsed last year in a major rain storm. So hooray!!! Seems like they expanded the menu here but I had to have my favorites and since I can't remember the names, I'll give you the Numbers's;73 and 43, uh this is the best I can remember so I will explain. Barbecue pork, fried egg rolls in a giant bowl of rice noodles, served with a small bowl of very nice sweet sauce. Love the pork, very special, thinly sliced and grilled to perfection. Parts of the meat, nicley carmelized.The table has a bottle of Siracha hot sauce, a bottle of Hoisin and a hot chili sauce. I love the trio of sauces, very nice touch to have on the table. They may go out of business with customers like me sqeezing tablespoons of the delightful sauces all over my food. Sweet and hot, makes the mouth water. The other dish has as a base, fried rice noodles and piled ""High and Deep"" are bok choy, broccoli, carrots, onions and shrimp and beef. The sauce is a rich blend of soy, ginger, fish sauce, ginger. This is one of my favorites. I love the crunchy rice noodles. The owners are genuine people who love cooking their native foods and have the gift of hospitality. Yummy Yummy Yummy. Would like to see some Asian beers, so that is my suggestion here. You will not be disappointed.",positive
"This place was closed for awhile, the roof collapsed after a rain storm....which was probably a good thing, the place was renovated and cleaned... which in most Vietnamese places, seems to be something needed. But, for all that, they've always had great service, terrific pho, and very nice lemongrass chicken. Their new menu is missing the ox tail pho, but it IS available if you ask! Delicious! Also get a coconut drink, try the rolls and anything with a fried egg on it! Cash only!",positive
"Stopped by today for lunch (Sunday 7-27-08). Pho Loc is closed, appears the roof collapsed. Looks like they are gone. :(",negative
"First, the service here is wonderful. Since I am realizing now more than ever how much I'm in the ""know"" when it comes to the Vietnamese community, I can say that this place is way up there on the service. And um, we know how service can be at your typical Asian establishment (just read other reviews). What to order, eh? The pho is good, but not the best. I order it because I can't make it myself. The bun soup is also good, especially the shrimp-laden variety. A little shrimp paste goes a LONG way. I like to nibble on grandma's because she can eat most of the bowl and I tend to get tired of the bun. The lemongrass chicken is the best in the Valley, according to my sister and I. It is a dry stir-fried dish, which I appreciate because isn't it easier to add a goopy garlic sauce and call it a dish? I think so, so I appreciate that they cook the sugar just past caramelized but before burnt, sautee the chicken in it and add soy, garlic, lemongrass and chili. It's all preference, I suppose. The cha gio (egg rolls) are some of the best I've had, though at $5 for two, I'm wondering why the soup is relatively cheap? An overall good experience.",positive
"Walked into the place very hungry so everything should taste great. Not so fast. First it was a display of poor hygiene by waiter who had to rub his inner nose with his fingers. Next up the bathroom, the dirtiest, nastiest bathroom in north america. Food itself was nothing spectacular. Quite the ordinary fare. In short it fits well within the china town establishments, not necessarily targeted toward western customers.",negative
I had the beef pho and it was absolutely delicious! The taste of the broth was epic and I will be back for more!!! Super friendly service as well! I definitely recommend!,positive
"Tasty food, one of the best spring rolls In Montreal. The phos are a bit salty to my taste. Price on the menu include taxes.",positive
"I had dinner here with my mom. My mom loves pho and she was really looking forward to having some pho in Montreal. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to her expectations. I had a non-pho dish, and it was just ok, in my opinion. My mom had the Special Pho (size small) $7.50. It had tripe, beef meatballs, rare beef and cooked beef. She said the beef was sliced really thin and there wasn't much of it, and the broth was too sweet. They were also stingy with the beef balls. They cut them up and she got 2 pieces that didn't even add up to one meatball. She said she felt that it wasn't even as good as pho in Orleans, ON (the sleepy suburb of Ottawa where she now lives). Ouch! I got the chicken in peanut butter sauce with crispy spinach, which comes with rice ($10.50). I liked that this dish came with vegetables. It had cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, green beans, bell peppers, carrots, onions and bok choy. The peanut sauce was thick and rich. The chicken was tender and flavourful. The veggies were fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, the fried spinach was so oily/greasy and tasted of old oil. I had one leaf and left the rest. The rice was good. Service was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is in the basement and decor is minimal. The people running the place seem nice. Maybe other dishes are better.",negative
"Lol, the food is microwaved. As I was waiting to pay for my meal, I literally saw them microwaving someone's food. Not impressed. I also feel like this restaurant is overrated. I had vermicelles noodles with beef and shrimps and I wasn't impressed. The beef was somewhat flavourful, although you could tell it wasn't freshly made, and the shrimps were plain.",negative
This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant! The food there is so great. I've been to many other Vietnamese restaurants but I guess it's the best. My favourite dish there is the 5-colour-rice. And soups are ALL good!,positive
"Highly recommend! My first time to try Pho is here, and before eating I haven't expected too much, but who knows, i love it right away! So amazing! The broth is light but flavorful, all is good, I drink it up every time... the grilled chicken, beef, pork are also quite great. I come here regularly now. Pho is one my favorite food here!",positive
"Been here twice and both times I was content and satisfied. I had Pho Bo the first time and Bun with Grilled Pork the second time. Authentic Vietnamese classic is what u get, not modified or westernised. Broth of the Pho soup was great, light, aromatic and flavourful. Comes in 3 different sizes which is great for small or big eater. The bun salad was fantastic too, paid an additional $1 for adding spring rolls in the bun salad. Service was humble and pleasant since the place is run by a family. I saw a little girl and her brother prepping the skin for the spring rolls at a table near the cashier/kitchen doors, reminds me of food vendors in most Southeast Asian hawkers. Ambience is very homey, nothing fancy, feels like an Asian family's home. It's clean and basic. Location of the restaurant is downstairs, it doesn't look attractive from the outside and sometimes it looks a bit deserted but once u r inside, u will see tables hidden in the corner row of tables and u will see all the Asians regulars eating their noodles. Price is very affordable for the quality you get. Will definitely be back if I visit Montreal again.",positive
"Great spot good soup and beef dishes. Extremely fast service. The veggies in the soup very fresh and tasty. Standard decor but great eats. The don't serve alcoholic beverages here. Tea, soda. Still worth the grub for sure. Big food portions too!",positive
Hit the spot on a rainy day. Got the duck noodle which tasted fresh. The kids enjoyed the pho while the hubby got the sweet and sour soup. It's a bit too sweet for my taste.,positive
"One of the best Satay Pho i've had ! Came here multiple times during my visit in Montreal. I absolutely love their Satay Pho. Their pho broth is rich and flavourful. Doesn't seem to be lacking taste. Really filling. Extremely recommended. Service is good, servers are extremely friendly.",positive
"A small underground pho place in Chinatown montreal. The place was pretty clean, the service was good. The waiter was very friendly. Very good pho. Love the satay pho, the broth is very flavourful. It's not the regular pho you get at other places it has unique taste to it. Definitely recommended. The banh xeo is really good. One of the best I've tasted. It is crispy on the outside yet soft. Pairs perfectly with the fish sauce. Comes with some vegetables that you use to wrap the view crepe with",positive
"Everything we ordered here are good! We ordered Pho, summer rolls, spring rolls and banh, so good! Pho noodles in 3 sizes, small, medium and large. The price is very reasonable as well!!! Highly recommended!",positive
"Really really good pho. We were craving pho while visiting Montreal and came here. It's right on the main strip, one flight below street level. The place is spacious and clean. The sauce bottles weren't dripping from usage. I had #11 rare beef and brisket; the small size was good for me. The beef was fresh and sliced thin. The noodles were perfectly done and the accoutrements were so fresh. Now the broth - flavorful and clean, really outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant.",positive
Our family is vegetarian and the server firstly assured us that he does have vegetarian options and recommended them. We ordered and all the dishes he suggested and they were excellent!! The order came quickly as well. Very efficient service. Food 5 stars!! Service 5 stars!!,positive
"Came here for authentic Phô and authentic it was. One of the best phô ever tasted. Don't pay attention to the decor, or lack of. It's your typical outdated phô joint but the authentic phô makes up for it.",positive
Excellent authentic food that also comes along with excellent service. I don't know for a fact but it seems like it's a family run place. The service was amazing. Portions were large and price was very reasonable. I will recommend this place to all my friends and come again in the future! I don't know how people had a hard time finding this place?? I found it with any problem and it was my first time to Chinatown in Montreal. Big sign outside... It's kinda hard to miss.,positive
"3.5/5, +.5 for service To lay it all open, this place is definitely worth a try. There are several Vietnamese places to try in Montreal's Chinatown, but this place stood off due to the reviews and the fact that the menu is quite diverse. You have to walk down a set of stairs to reach the restaurant entrance, and there is no elevator so if you need accessibility assistance...you may be out of luck. I took away half a star for that, though I do understand the constraints of opening restaurants in the downtown core. When my family and I arrived at around 11:30am on a Sunday, the restaurant was quite empty, though by the time we left it was about 3/4 full. Either way, there's definitely business here and I can see why considering the food quality. I didn't know what to order at first, but after looking at the diverse options here, I went with the banh canh cua (thick noodles in crab soup), as not many Vietnamese places have that (or let alone, do it properly). To share with my family, I added a beef rice paper roll, since I wanted to try something a little different from spring rolls. The banh canh cua came first, and I was glad with the fact they use real Vietnamese transparent noodles, instead of cheap udon that I've had in other Vietnamese restaurants. The noodles were a little soggy for my liking, as I'm used to the thick noodles being a bit chewy, however it still tasted very good. The broth was also quite flavourful, but also not very MSGy as I didn't have the thirsty feel after. The rice paper roll was actually a do it yourself project, and was quite a unique experience. The server will teach you how to dip the rice paper into the warm water, then put the meat, vermicelli, veggies, and finally wrap it into a roll. We messed up a few times and ended up making tacos and burritos, but eventually we got the hang of it. Either way, the beef paper rolls tasted very good, and definitely something I would order again. My parents were all satisfied with their noodle soups, although the satay beef noodle soup is actually very spicy...thought I'd give you a heads up. Service was excellent, and the employees I found were very hardworking, as there were only two people running the shop during the time I was there. I'm sure they have more people, but they were very efficient.",positive
"Not much to say: -The place is hard to find, in the basement, with a sketchy decor and front door -The service was quick and nice -The prices are low, the amounts are big -The food is so, SO yum Get the Egg Rolls Get the chicken soup with vegetable",positive
"Was in Montreal for my friends birthday and chose to have diner here based on the reviews. Service was okay nothing special, that could also be because we got there 45 minutes to closing time. I ordered the Basil stir fry with shrimps and rice because I wanted to try something different. Bad idea. I got 4 small pieces of Stale shrimps that had already gone bad and a whole bunch of vegetables. I was so disappointed! The only good thing about dinner were the emperor rolls which I loved! 1 star.",negative
"I was never a big fan of pho, but I really like this place. $10 gets you a big bowl of pho topped with beef. Unlike other phos, the soup in this place actually has a flavor. Also, the hot sauce they provided on the table does not taste sour at all.",positive
"When my wife and I came to Montreal for Osheaga 2013, she took an afternoon shopping and I went to Chinatown for Pho. I did not come here, but instead crowded into another Pho place where you had squeeze between lines of other customers at family-style tables. This time, (September 2014) the wife joined me and we had little gremlins in tow so the prospect of waiting to find a seat for all of us sent us here. We arrived for an early lunch and were seated quickly. Know that Pho Saigon is located below strew level, and the steps to reach it are narrow and steep. Take them slow and easy, especially in the winter. The restaurant is clean and neatly appointed. It features very simple and tasteful decor, and at the time it was not too cluttered. There's a flatscreen TV on the wall, which we could pretty much care less about. Since we were there before the lunch crowd, the service was very quick. One of my gremlins loves Pho Ga, the other is more into noodles, so that's what they ordered. My wife and I had Pho Bo Vien (if I remember correctly). Here's the thing, the food was good, no doubt. Hot, fresh, and tasty. However (and you knew this was coming), on this particular day, and with our Pho, it was not transcendent. If you're a Pho-lover, then you know it's all about transcendence -- the full umami mouth feel, the savoriness of the broth, the distinctive clash of meat, noodle, and vegetable textures, all punctuated by the sting of the lime, peppers, and sriracha. Sadly, we did not feel that the Pho we had (on this day) possessed that transcendence. It was tasty. We enjoyed it, but did not feel compelled to drain the bowls as we have at other places. But please, you must try it for yourself. Palates vary, and it's quite possible we arrived too early and the broth just hadn't ""hit it"" yet. Also know, that as the lunch service gets busier, service slows down, as can be expected. Great prices -- a family of four for $35 is on of the best values you'll get in Montreal. Oh and before I forget, there's no booze. We'll be sure to try it again and edit the review if necessary.",negative
I've tried all the pho places in Chinatown because we live nearby and this place is definitely the best! We eat here almost every week! They make their pho broth from scratch so the flavours are really rich and authentic. It's really inexpensive too- probably why we go so often. Most of the meals are under ten bucks. I really like the Beef Satay Pho and the grilled pork chop meal.,positive
"We came in here based on the stellar Yelp reviews and high star rating. The Pho was amazing. Spring rolls, too. It's been a long time since I've tasted a bowl so good. Service is a bit... spotty, but in a weird way, the order mixup we experienced seemed to add to the charm of the place. The bottom line: I'll be back here the second I return to Montreal.",positive
"Maybe it was our mistake for not getting the Pho or maybe it was because the B-Team was in the kitchen that night - but about the only good thing at our visit was the service. The food was remarkably flavorless, which for a fresh cuisine like Vietnamese was a first for me. The shrimp that appeared in a number of our dishes was soggy and flavorless, reminiscent of the too-cheap frozen variety. The shredded pork was dry, gritty and tasted off. Our food was only occasionally punctuated by the fresh taste of basil or mint - but otherwise was just not good. The service, however, was excellent. Our waiter was cheerful, efficient, and welcoming. He switched right to English when he heard my girlfriend and I trying to work our dubious French. I have to wonder if something was off that night in the kitchen, especially given the other reviews and an experience like this in a city known for its excellent Vietnamese cuisine.",negative
"Probably the best phö spot in Montreal, but don't tell anyone. Okay, maybe tell one or two people, and then start a super secret phö gang with them. And then, as your gang grows stronger, invite a few more people to join. Eventually, your gang will be so powerful and this restaurant will be so popular that they'll need to open a second location... but don't tell anyone about that one.",positive
"Pho...kin savory. Stick pork tendon, tripe, and beef in pho....stick grilled porkchop, egg, rice and pulled pork on my plate....dayum good. all the servers are so affable. All vietnamese fams be eatin up in hea. Clean and organized resto. Zero negatives.....zeeeerrrroooooo",positive
"Humble, friendly, fresh-faced Pho on lower St Laurent, totally willing to switch up spicy soup options to make them vegetarian for me, careful to warn me that the broth would still be chicken. The resulting soup was light, spicy, not oily, or too spicy, and amazingly aromatic. For $8! The decor is simple. The ceiling and the storage area are both a tiny bit unfortunate and on a rainy day so is the basement smell, but the soup! the soup! Curative for sure.",positive
"Best pho I've ever had, and I eat a lot of pho. It's all about the quality of the broth, and this place has it. Don't let the semi-hidden basement location put you off, those are usually the best places anyway.",positive
"Love the Pho! I travel all over the world and try to get Pho wherever I go. This is one of the best I've had. It's on the sweet side, not overly salty like you can get in other places. A plus is this place is a clean, friendly family place. VN iced coffee pretty good too.",positive
"We usually go all the way down to scarborough for pho, but we dont have to anymore! We went to pho tai bac on a whim, because we were craving pho after a 6 hour roadtrip. The pho definitely hit the spot. The broth was super hot and flavourful. Fresh rolls were also wonderful. We are so glad we dont have to go so far for good pho anymore !",positive
"Tired this Pho restaurant last Saturday. I ordered a XL-size special pho at $10.25 plus tax. Affordable price and good taste. I think it's the best Pho restaurant in Richmond hill area, but the place is not very clean.",positive
"This is now my go-to Viet restaurant. It's a total hidden gem. The dishes are decently portioned and reasonably priced. I particularly like their rare beef & soft tendon pho (#23 on the menu). I literally get this almost every time. If I'm not getting the 23, then its the bun rieu, (#8B on the menu) which is basically rice noodle in a tofu and tomato/shrimp soup base. It doesn't sound like anything special, but o my goodness, that bowl of noodles is packed with flavor. Don't knock it til you try it!!! The only thing I wouldn't recommend is probably their pad Thai - the flavor is a little odd for me, and the last time I got it, it looked quite small on the plate. This place is getting more and more popular, so do try to come earlier for dinner because it starts getting pretty packed at around 7pm even on a weekday evening. Cheers!",positive
Favourite pho place I've ever been to. Gone o multiple places all over toronto and this one is always consistent with its broth. never a bad day,positive
"The soup was oily for what you call authentic vietnamese pho. I asked the chef in the back to remake the bowl but all she did was scoop up the bigger blobs of oil and hand it back to me. I would like to also mention that I asked for no onions in my pho and she put onions on it. Please read the slip carefully before making the pho because there are customers who may be allergic to onions, thanks.",negative
"Really good Pho. They're a good authentic alternative to Little Saigon if you cannot tolerate waiting there. The Pho has a good broth that isn't salty. I also go for their bun thit nuong, which is vermicelli with pork and fish sauce. It's really my new fav and should be tried here.",positive
"Typical Vietnamese pho restaurant, had all the normal selections and decent prices. Great service and clean tables (nothing is sticky or greasy like some places). Definitely better than Xelua (pho train)! Open on Christmas Eve, closed Christmas!",positive
"As an update to my previous review, the food standards have been more or less keep at a satisfactory level. The pho that my friends and I ordered were tasty and bold in flavour, but in terms of heat the soup could definitely have been hotter. The overall experience was brought down by the servers, who I presume were the daughters or family members of the establishment seeing how they were speaking to one another. At one point, you could hear a young woman behind the counter on the phone who was yelling out about her plans to visit a bar and club. In addition, the treatment of the younger waitress (again I assume in a family member) was absolutely horrendous and was done in a harsh tone. I understand cultural backgrounds and family relationships play into why this happened, but the overall professionalism and image of the establishment went downhill after that performance. If I wanted to hear yelling, drinking and who to hook up with at a club, I would've taken my pho in a college dorm.",negative
"Richmond Hill seems to have a good selection of Pho restaurants, and Pho Tai Bac is no exception. My wife and I originally intended to go to Little Saigon but the lineup was out the door. With a hungry stomach and an urge for Vietnamese soup noodles, we found this place. First impressions: + Packed with people (didn't have to wait as long - their space is slightly larger than Little Saigon) + Authentic (owners are actually Vietnamese) - Really cold (rainy weather, blasted AC, who knows?) - At busy times, servers are a bit inattentive (no utensils, had to call down server to get a ticket to write order) Ordered two Pho Tai Nam (rare/cooked beef) in a small and large portion size. The small is pretty standard in appearance, but there's slightly more noodles. The large is pretty filling and has a good balance of ingredients. Both are really well priced. The broth is pretty clean tasting and flavourful - just the right amount of seasoning. The meat is of pretty good quality; no chewy or overly fatty pieces. And judging by the plate, it looks like they actually clean their bean sprouts. Good by my books. All in all, a good spot for Pho if your favourite one happens to be full. If you can deal with the mediocre service, their pho is something you won't PHOget.",positive
"So originally we intended to go to Little Saigon which is in the plaza directly north of this one, but there was a sign on the door that said the restaurant is on vacation. Not renovation, vacation. I guess, it worked to hard over the years and needed a break? So we ended up here at Pho Tai Bac, Little Saigon's competition. We arrived around 18:30. The place was not full, and we were seated immediately. By 19:00, place was packed and line was out the door. The place is family owned and operated (by Chinese Vietnamese). The staff speaks many languages as I was able to discern Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Teo Chew, and English. Credit cards are not accepted so make sure you bring cash. The decor is typical of Pho places, plastic (formica laminated) tables and chairs. Sauces and utensils lay in containers and are stationed right at your table for self service. The service was good and typical of Asian restaurants: you call them if you need something. They only come to clear empty dishes, otherwise they leave you alone. The staff remained friendly, thanking you for your business and greeting you adieu. On the menu for today is the staples: Pho, Com, Bun, Cha Gio, and a Sour Sop Shake. #42. Pho Dac Biet (Dac Biet means ""special"", which basically means it has everything in it). The broth is the star here and performed decently. It was slightly on the salty side, but carried pho flavour. Star anise was also noticeable. Very good meat to pho to broth ratio with the large bowl as every spoonful had all three elements. 4 stars. #74. Bun Bo/Thit/Ga Nuong (Vermicelli with Beef/Pork/Chicken). This dish is all about the fish sauce. Depending on the region, the sauce will differ in taste. Here, it was pretty balanced. No overpowering fishiness and not too sweet. 3 stars. The meats carried good flavours, but were a little light on the grilling. 3,5 stars. #127. Com. Tam Thap Cam (Pork chop and chicken). Same as the bun, meats well flavoured, but light on the grilling. 3,5 stars. The rice was mushy (too much water?), and they skimped in the onion oil. 1 star. The vegetables were huge, and had all the right ones, no skimping on ingredients here. 4 stars. Overall 3 stars. #1. Cha Gio (Spring Rolls). They used a Chinese spring roll wrap... wrong! The ingredients were ok. 2 stars. The fish sauce was the same as the other dishes. 3 stars. Again did not skimp on accompaniments, carrots, radish, lettuce and noodles. All were fresh. 5 stars. Overall 3 stars. #158. Soursop shake. This was not good. To much ice. Too little soursop. 1 star. Like many places they have high points and low points. I'd return for some dishes but would stay away from others. 3 stars overall. --------------- Pho flavours are highly subjective and expectations depend greatly on which region you're from (if Vietnam is your motherland). If Vietnam is not your motherland, here's a really quick summary of what you should expect in terms of flavour for each major region. Decide on the one you like, and search for your Pho-vourite place. Know what you're eating before you judge... North (Hanoi). Simple dishes often influenced by tradition. Strict pairings of ingredients and the cooler climate makes stewing a popular method of cooking. Black Pepper tends to replace most spices. Light, yet balanced flavours make up all the complexity. Lots of Chinese influence due to geographical proximity to China. Signature dishes include: Pho, Bun rieu, Bun cha, banh cun. Central (Hue & Hoi An). Former Imperial Capital. More spices are used and greater care is taken with regards to presentation. Due to heritage, meals tend to be more luxurious with multiple course meals. Food is spicier than the North and there is less Chinese influence. Hoi An is unique in that it where North meets Central, often fusing the two cuisines. Signature dishes include: Com hen, Cao Lau, Banh Mi. South (Saigon). Warmer climate = higher harvest yields, so liberality is often displayed with southern dishes. Flavours are bolder and more vibrant with the use of fresh herbs. They also tend to favor the sweet side through the use of coconut milk. French influence in some of the cuisine due to occupancy during the war. Signature dishes include: Banh Khoai, Bánh xèo, Goi Cuon.

"My go-to pho restaurant when craving for something soupy and comforting. Introduced to this place by a friend and have been coming back time after time. The restaurant is very clean, brightly lit. All the condiments and utensils are arranged neatly on the trays at the table. Floors are clean and the storefront is not crammed, unlike many other pho places. There're always customers no matter what time of day, indication of a quality authentic restaurant. Soup base is flavourful and hot. Meat and toppings are plentiful and the herbs and bean sprouts are always fresh. I usually order a small #42 or Bun Bo Hue, both are delicious. They have a wide selection of apps, the Cha Gio (spring rolls) and the vietnamese omelette are both really good. Parking is plentiful in the plaza. Try this place regardless whether or not you live in the area!",positive
My favourite go to restaurant for pho. The quality of the food is exceptional when compared to other locations. A friendly environment that delivers quality dishes with variety of spices and herbs. Quick and an accessible location for the Richmond Hill community.,positive
Came here tonight and it absolutely surprised me how good this place was. As many of the other people said the soup base was amazing. Definitely some good spices and herbs and it wasn't too salty. I don't normally drink the soup too often when I go to pho places but this was a different experience for me. I cannot get enough of it! The portions of meat is good too. The vermicelli was quite standard and I felt the spring rolls didn't stand out to me too much. I'll just stick with the pho next time which is fine by me. This place is packed which is a great sign and all of the servers were very polite. One accidentally spilled water on my phone and she apologized and came back to ask if it was really ok. The phone is fine and I'm writing this great review for them. Will be back for more pho!,positive
Best Vietnam restaurant in the neighborhood. We came here for a quick dinner and fell in love. We have been to Vietnam and this is the closest thing in York region. Great service as well!,positive
Service - friendly owners and staffs. Food - Good. I like their steam rice rolls. Noodles are good. Broth is not salty. No MSG. Portion is decent and good balance between meat and noodles. Atmosphere - clean and neat. Price - decent. Will go back again!,positive
"Probably the best pho place in the GTA. Its always busy during dinner, but the food comes really quickly, so we've never had to wait too long. The decor is a little lacking, but it's not a big deal imo.",positive
"This place is the younger sister of Pho Con Bo at Jane and Wilson....been visiting that location for 5 years, and upon discovering this new one I felt blessed. The lady owner is a sweetheart ( bad thing the daughter didn't take after her), food's always on point, prices ridiculously cheap...best pho places in GTA. Keep it up guys, we love you!!!",positive
"The BF wanted a ""bun rieu"" and saw a picture on yelp that they had it so we decided to drop by. Turns out they didn't have it, the BF was devastated and just got a ""bun bo hue"" instead. He thought it was okay, the soup lacked the tomato base, thin and just spicy. Since we dropped by early, I wasn't too hungry so I got their shrimp and pork roll and their avocado smoothie. The roll was okay, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I ended up just eating one roll and took the other one to go. I was disappointed in the avocado smoothie, it was basically avocado and pieces of ice. I was chewing on ice each time I took a sip. The place is quaint, not too busy so if you want a hideaway place to eat this would be the perfect place for you. Service was good, the staff were friendly. Overall this place is average, it would be two stars but I added the extra star is for service and the friendliness of staff. I probably won't come back again :(",negative
The broth is the best I've ever had (Not oily) Healthy! I'm blessed to live a block away from this place. Authentic pho made by a lovely Vietnamese Family.,positive
Love the bun rieu and bun bo hue here- didn't feel like I was dying of thirst after my meal. Their fresh rolls contain both shrimp and pork belly which I appreciated. Will definitely be one of my new go to pho places as it is quite authentic,positive
The Pho noodle soup was awesome and the restaurant was clean. The service provided was good. I would definitely be back to try more items on the menu.,positive
I was excited to have a Vietnamese restaurant with good hours opened in my neighbourhood. The Pho broth is not too salty but the portion of the regular size noodles is on the small side. Their vermicelli is portioned better and they also have Banh Cuon! The restaurant is bright and clean and service is good. They also have WIFI which is a plus. A great place to go in the area.,negative
"We ordered pho noodle and vermicelli. The broth was average in the soup, but the vegetables were not fresh in the vermicelli. Overall, below average experience. There are better Vietnamese places nearby.",negative
"Yesssssssssss this place was delicious. A+++ pho. Their broth was flavourful, and well seasoned. Their noodles were great and their herbs were fresh. You KNOW this place is going to be slamming because out front they have pictures of their food. Only hole in the walls that are amazing do this and they did not disappoint. I also ordered their bun bo hue and it was yummy and spicy and well done. Not too salty or over spiced. I will definitely be back when in the area because they were awesome.",positive
"This is probably the best pho place in the GTA, I've tried all the popular pho places in the GTA, and this one is nothing like the others. I can taste they don't put alot of MSG in it. I highly recommend this place.",positive
"Went there after a stroll at Hillcrest mall and stumbled on this little resto near by. Big fan of pho, this is actually to my surprise not too shaby. Ordered a pho tai (rare beef) and banh cuon (rice rolls). Broth was not bad, but I did like te noodles since they were on the softer side (many places prep it more aldente), but I would say 6.5/10 for the overall. Rice rolls were decent as well. Rice roll had a good consistency, but the cha than came with it wasn't great. If you order this platter, just stick with the rolls. If you;re in the area and in the mood for pho, this is not a bad place. You won't be disappointed.",negative
First time here. I was looking for a Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp and I found this one nearby. I asked the waitress if they have any vegan options here and she said she can serve me a spicy veggie soup with rice noodles. Its always appreciated when a restaurant accommodate to different lifestyles. The soup was delicious. Fresh ingredient and great spices. The closest a vegan can get to pho. Service is super friendly. Prices are affordable. Overall this is a nice family owned Vietnamese restaurant. Worth checking out.,positive
"Yes!! Finally, a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill. Most of the good pho is in Vaughan so I'm very happy a more convenient location popped up. The menu is pretty comprehensive in its selection, and the prices seem to be lower than the average Viet restaurant. While the restaurant itself is spacious, they don't actually have too many tables set up. We came here for lunch and ordered: - Spring rolls: A small order gives you two spring rolls, and they were pretty big. The filling was meaty and went well with the dipping sauce. - Bun bo hue: While the broth only had a tiny hint of spiciness, it was still very flavourful and not overly salty. This had a generous amount of toppings, including pig's blood, Viet pork roll and beef. A plate of purple cabbage was also on the side. - Beef pho with rare beef and beef flank: Broth was clear and light. Asked for the rare beef on the side as we don't like it to be overcooked, and it was very fresh and tender. The beef pho comes in four sizes so you have a choice to cater to your appetite. The food came quickly and the service was very friendly. Overall, this restaurant is great for its value with its lower than average prices, generous portions and most importantly, good food.",positive
"I have been to this restaurant three time so far and it's safe to say every time it gets better and better. The service is fast, the hostest is friendly, and the food is cheep. I have had pho many times before and this establishment stands out on a league of its own, for its great portions and food that is obviously cooked from the heart. I will continue to visit the great eatery, and enjoy every minute of the Vietnamese pop music ;) p.s the pha thai is killer",positive
"We recently came back from Vietnam and was really craving Pho. This place is really good!! The soup tastes well balanced not too salty or sweet. Noodle was cooked just right. We asked for cooked bean sprout. Try the chunky chilli sauce and the oyster sauce with lemon - so good!! Oh and the avocado slush was yummy. Not too sweet, tasted natural, and blended well. :) Overall, this is our new fav Pho place!!",positive
"I'm sad to leave a 2 star rating for a Pizza Hut that I've always enjoyed and used to manage when I was super young. Therefore, I'm familiar with what it means to have good service and eat quality, well made pizza. My last couple orders have been underwhelming with my stuff crust pizzas... Which my kids love by the way...I found the dough was not rolled out properly nor were the slices even cut all the way through. When I grab a slice of pizza, the slice had to be re-cut and it would fall apart in your hand because the dough was so thin and you can tell they tried to fix it by merging more dough on top... Which never works. So basically, we had to eat chunks of pizza scraps because the pizza dough was a mess. Definitely need some improvement at this location.",negative
Phone in pick up order on a Saturday night. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it was! The pizza looks great. Smells amazing. Lots of cheese and toppings. Very hot even after 6 min drive home. We ordered ham and pineapple and a Canadian. Both pizzas are delicious. Not greasy. Crust is soft and perfect. Boneless bites chicken honey BBQ is good. Kids loved them. Definitely worth our money and happy to order again.,positive
"I was wandering around aimlessly hoping to find something I haven't eaten in a while. I found this Pizza Hut, it was either that or the nearby Taco Bell. I should have chosen the Taco Bell. I was greeted by a pleasant young lady who's nice smile and perky demeanour earned the only star in this restaurant. There was a special, buy a large pizza, 5 toppings for 16 bucks. Not much of a special but that plus the twelve dollar add on for a two litre of pop, breadsticks and 8 wings. (The sign saying ten wings was covered over with a sharpie marker saying eight. Cheap out two wings because calgarians will pay more right?) 15 minutes for it to be ready, I sat down. Twenty minutes later I stood up so I don't get forgotten about. Three minutes after that I got my food handed to me. It was sitting in the warming tray, they forgot I was sitting there... On the way home I ate the breadsticks. The marinara was tastey but the breadsticks not too fresh and not too flavourful. The pizza was pretty good and I was satisfied. The boneless wings were poorly put together. It was like someone took some chicken nuggets, and threw its dipping sauce in the box. (See photo ) The advertisement shows the boneless wings to be smothered in sauce, like they are tossed in a bowl to coat every bit of it. It's not a hard process, I can do it at home. When you pay 12 bucks for wings, two litre pop, and a version of crazy bread, it should taste good. Not make you wish you had gone to costco and make it yourself. Honestly, this negative review would not be online if I hadn't felt like they rip you off on wings and breadsticks. I mean come on, writing over the number 10 with 8. Then seeing him dump two bags into the fryer minus the two he took out by hand. (Meaning each bag is sold with five, and intended to have 5 per serving, not 4, for every other Pizza Hut in canada) plus they took no care in saucing them. Anyways, one day I will give this location another chance, and hopefully I will amend my review, but considering its store policy to give you less than everywhere else in canada, I doubt their generosity will increase anytime soon.",negative
Makes Pizza Hut look real bad! Cheap on the toppings! Bad service! Never again! I would rather drive to another Pizza Hut. Very disappointing.,negative
"Tonight we ordered the ""family size"" lasagna, order of honey bbq wings, bread sticks and garlic toast!!! Word of the night ""GROSS"" The lasagna was disgusting and their idea of family size was enough to feed two people!!! The wings were ok but we will not ever be ordering from here again!!! Huge disappointment",negative
"You know the pizza really sucks when on the receipt it shows you to the ounce how much topping you are getting. I don't know if I was supposed to see this receipt or if it was the stores copy, but I got it anyway. Am I naive in thinking that pizza places just randomly top a pizza with your choice of toppings? I would think that it would take more effort to measure out 0.3 oz of mushrooms than to just throw a handful on, no? I understand the whole meat and cheese thing and yes, they are more costly ingredients where measuring them out would make some sense but SERIOUSLY measuring the veg? Pizza Hut, you have reached a new low. Sooo disappointed in this chain, it used to be half decent and one of my favourites about 10 years back, now I could feel the chunks emerging. Some of the best pizza I've had were from mom and pop shops set up in surrounding neighbourhoods. BOOOO Pizza Hut, you should be ashamed of yourself. Little Ceasers is now better than you and that isn't saying much.",negative
"If you order from here and the internet says it will be ready in 15 minutes....add at least an hour to that. This is the second time I've been to this location and the second time they have been this slow. Neither time has been a holiday or something like Super Bowl Sunday, just normal days. It's been 6 months or so since our last visit. I don't know that I will to try here again.",negative
"At 8:30 on Friday night, after holding for almost 10 minutes and being hung up on, I was told they were not taking any orders at that time. Their ovens were running behind as were deliveries. W H A T? So let me get this straight, Pizza Hut made ALL the money they needed to make today so they just not going to take any more orders. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! Pizza Hut just lost a 30 year customer.",negative
"They're so slow. I ordered a pizza at 6:30 that said it would be ready by 7:20, by the time I go there it was 6 people waiting, one lady had been waiting for her pizza that she ordered at 5pm. I ended up leaving and had to cancel my order, was told that my points would go back on my account so I could get my free pizza, once canceled I was told it would take 24-48 hours before I could get my points. So now I have to reorder pizza from a different location but this is terrible I will never order from this location again. The worker also dropped ingredients on the floor and picked them up to use them.",negative
"I get weekly emails form Pizza Hut offering me some kind of deal. Including this time, the last two attempts to use the coupon codes from the emails this location refused to honor these codes. What's the purpose of me getting weekly emails with my local Pizza Hut doesn't accept the deals offered? Don't waste your time we Pizza Hut go to Jets or Marcos...better food better price.",negative
"Both pizza was cold and one was cold and burnt smh it taken them 1hr45mins plus to bring it! call the first time and they say it was on its way that was at 6:45 call back again because still no pizza it's 7:30 now no pizza and i stay less than a mile away from them... the lady just felt out lied because when I called back at 7:30 my pizza just had went out at 7:15 when you told me my pizza out for delivery remind you that she say my pizza was already out for delivery at 6:45 smh long story short just don't get any thing from here!!! I ordered here again to see if they get it right!! nope they didn't they say it will be a 1hr wait and it taken them 3hr.... And when we call them the Manger try to make it seem like it was our fault and going to say why I didn't order before dark, we did it was 4:10 when we order... Little do she know I was recording the whole time when we was on the phone and I will be putting this on YouTube and sending to the corporate office",negative
So disappointed. I keep seeing the commercials on repeat advertising the new pizza and Spider-Man movie. And I tell you the marketing worked. It got me to order. But never again. It was like eating day old pizza. The mozzarella cheese bite crust had no cheese in them. They where hallow holes Bc the cheese ran out all over. Because the pizza was cooled down by the time it arrived it missed the mark completely.,negative
"Not sure why I still order here, after tonight I will never make that mistake again. I ordered the pizza a little after 9 it said it would be an hour or so. Ok so I waited about 10:30 I called and the staff member said he left 15 minutes ago he's on his way I said ok. That meant to me he made other deliveries so I waited. At 10:40 I called back and no one would answer the phone. I called from 2 different phones online it said they close at 12. So about 10 after 11 I decided I should ride by there. I get there it's like a few minutes away and the whole crew is sitting outside smoking. Wow so I asked what was going on, the manager said oh I thought you said a different address. I said so that means you wasn't listening to me?she said our phones are muffled and I couldn't hear you. Really ma'am? So I tried explaining to her why I was upset, she didn't want to hear anything I said at all, too busy enjoying her cigarette I guess. I asked for my money back, she called her driver and he was at my house. The pizza was cold, he said he had a whole lot of deliveries and he was the only driver. So I'm standing in the parking lot with the crew it's like 5 of them standing there smoking and he's the only driver, really? So she went inside to refund my order to her forever sent another lady out to show me my refund. Very unprofessional manager, she could careless about what was going on wow. Never again",negative
"I will not order another pizza from this location. I ordered a pizza online at 7pm and was told that it would take 1hr and 30min to ready for pick up. I get there before 8:30pm (I should have checked the pizza before I left too trusting) picked up my pizza, got home, got comfy, opened up the box and was disgusted. The pizza looked like it has been sitting in the warmer for hours. it was dry and tasted like the cardboard. It was a waste of my money. The only good part was the chocolate chip cookie pie that I ordered. I ate that and called it a night. I work 2 jobs and was too tired to call or go back up to the store seeing that I had to be up that night in another 2hrs to go to the next job. I won't order from them again. I work too hard for my money to be wasted.",negative
Pizza was more than 45 mins past the 1 hour promised delivery time. Called store repeatedly (7 times over 30 mins period) to see what was going on and was hung up on. When pizza finally arrived I advised the driver that I didn't feel it was fair for me to pay full price - she said fine and took the food back. Finally got through to manager and he advised that it is a Friday and 2 hours for my food is to be expected. He said I should have insisted she leave the food and then he would have given me a $5 credit. He advised that it was my fault because I did not insist she leave the food? He was upset with me because now HE was out the product for my $12 order??! This is not the first ridiculous experience with Lawyers Rd Pizza Hut. But it will def be my last.,negative
"I at tached pictures in case you don't believe this. Just because you run a special doesn't mean you have to rip people off. I got a large two topping pizza. I noticed this ""large pie"" would not feed me much less me and my two kids! And moms not even here to eat. By the way this took 20 minutes to be ready. So I stopped on way home fir a hot and ready so kiddos could get full......exact same size!!! And it was ready instantly. I have always like pizza huts flavor but when you treat your customers like we are dumb we are done. Me and my kids are still laughing at this poorly made tiny little pizza. Bty why put a pizza in avocado that has lots of room to make it look bigger.... Seriously?! Box exact same size pizza was smaller. What a joke we will not eat Pizza Hut again sadly. Please look for pictures I attached unless they take them down.",negative
"This place is horrible! I had placed an order one day and they had messed it up the pizza was soggy and just disgusting to eat. So I called the store was put on hold for a while and never got ahold of anyone so I emailed the survey in and a few days later the management team called me from the store and tried to claim that it was MY fault for the order being messed up and I should of paid more attention to it and this and that. But after a while of going back and forth they credit me a Large one topping pizza. Fast forward.... My wife and I were lazy and figured we'd use the deal, so I called in placed the order and we waited. After about an hour our pizza guy got here and he hands me the pizza. On top of the box was the receipt and he snatches it off the top and crumbles it up (at this point he still hasn't said one thing to me) he then turns around throws the receipt on the floor in yard and storms the hell off. I mean what the hell. Not sure what his attitude and deal was maybe he hates his job? I don't know. The pizza sucked anyways waste of time. And the management is horrible at this place. I'll stick to dominos.",negative
"Its is your typical Pizza Hut pizza. This location is a carry out/delivery only. The carry out deals are great, amd since this is close to home, we take advantage of those. I found that the delivery drivers havr no personality; they have forgotten to deliver things I've ordered like soda or my side of bread sticks, amd I never get my ranch or blue cheese when they deliver wings. Overall..wings are good, pizza is typical, and they have good deals.",negative
"I've lived close to this place for years, but never ate here as I figured it was a cheap college hangout with cheap, runny sauce. Wow, I was wrong! I got the pepperoni/meatball pizza - it was amazing!! Thin crust, but not too thin. Crispy bottom. Perfection.",positive
It's neighborhood hangout. Food is average.. I have a couple favorites. Calzones often doughy. Salads a very fresh and crisp. Guacamole gross and over spicy. The saddest part is most of their wait staff don't smile. There are a couple that work weekdays that are fun and friendly. The hostess seating me didn't even smile today. Many have been there for years and seem unhappy. Today I basically had one totally ignore me. I knew I'd be there for awhile working between events in town and would have tipped over 20% for being there. If your not buying alcohol I guess your not worth the time. I even told her I wanted to order a pizza To go for a 4:00 event. She said they take 1/2 hour. She basically never spoke or acknowledged me again. Even went to bar to get my bill and she didn't respond after 3 attempts and standing by my table with my coat on. I should have walked out without paying.,negative
"I'm an undergraduate at John Carroll and this has always been my go to if I'm not feeling the cafe food. I got the seafood pasta and it was great. The shrimp was excellent and the Diablo sauce was perfect. The atmosphere of pizzazz is great, everyone is so friendly! I defiantly suggest you come check this place out!",positive
"The house salad dressing was awesome. The pizza came out and looked AMAZING. I remember thinking, wow this is gonna be delicious. It had no flavor. I sprinkled Parmesan and red pepper flakes to give it some flavor. Maybe they forgot to add seasoning? Not sure. Looked good though!",negative
"The atmosphere is kind of cold but nobody I know has ever acknowledged it. Service is fine and many young people work there. Pizza is fine but not the best I've ever had, or even the best in Cleveland. Salad dressing is really acidic. Also, fries? At an Italian place?",negative
"Not impressed. My husband likes to occasionally stop and get pizza here because of the convenient location between his work and our home, and quite honestly because Pizzazz takes credit cards and Geracis requires cash on hand. The last time we ordered pizzas from Pizzazz, they were both watery: the topping layer would immediately slide off of the dough base leaving you with one big bite of toppings and many bites of boring, soggy dough. We also had fried provolone which smelled and tasted like it had burnt plastic in it and the cheese was dense unless eaten quickly while sizzling hot. I wouldn't let my toddler eat it for fear of choking and not understanding the harsh smell- although my husband and I both tried some and we're fine. I don't understand the hype, except that we Heights people try to support our local family businesses and Pizzazz has been in this area for a long time. They do have a lovely spot on Fairmount circle.",negative
"Asked waiter if they had meat balls, he then smirked and proceeded to say ""You can meet these balls"" . Very rude and disrespectful service will not come here again . Still didn't get my meatballs . Restaurant does not deliver .",negative
"We stopped in the other day, myself and AN, we split the chips and guac, a small pizza with double pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, onion and green pepper, it's our traditional date night pizza. And for dessert we had the cannoli! It was the best pizza we've ever had and AN and myself have had pizza all over the U.S. from NY, to California, to Chicago and many more places, Pizzazz is still the best pizza, the best service and always feels like home.",positive
"Pizzazz is just a typical ""Italian"" restaurant in my opinion. They have your pastas, pizzas, calzones... I'm actually unsure why they are so popular when Little Italy is just 15 minutes away. I'm going to guess convenience, since it is located across the street from John Carroll University (and that is exactly how I ended up there!). I went after class with some friends and found it to be very mediocre. All three of our entrees were just unimpressive, though definitely edible. The cost of the meal I found to be just a tad expensive considering I wasn't having any mouthgasms. As a side note, I have also previously had their pizzas, which is what they are known for. Again... just some pretty typical pizza. I honestly would rather eat Pizza Hut.",negative
"Had a nice lunch here with friends. The warm Pizzazz sub with capicola, ham, & provolone on a sesame seed bun was tasty, and really loved the option for grilled asparagus & zucchini instead of fries. A friend enjoyed the grilled portobello, and another had the Italian sub. Friendly & fast service. Cool location on the circle!",positive
Kind of pricey for the amount of food you get the food is high quality but it's kind of pricey and it's always crowded too many people in a small space,negative
"This is a great pizza spot right by John Carroll University in University Heights. My family loves to go here in the summer and sit out on the patio. The salads and dressing are really good - everything I have ordered has been great, but favorite is still the pizza! The staff could be a little more professional...lots of young staff probably students from the university. Great spot though!",positive
I do service work for pizzazz and the people who own it are very very nice. They have the best pizza around. Ive been to Italy and had great pizza there but i prefer pizzazz. Their salads are excellent too and the dressing is a work of culinary art! I highly recommend visiting this place if you love pizza.,positive
I used to love this place when I was growing up in Shaker but I got it after moving back to Ohio from Cali and this place has gone downhill. Food is not cooked or made well. I had the Pesto Pizza and Stuffed Gnnochi and it did not impress or bring back memories why I loved the place growing up. It looked like they have just a bunch of teenagers working there. Don't know if they just don't care about the experience they hire now..,negative
"A few friends and I were in the neighborhood and decided to give Pizzazz a shot. A very clean, well dressed neighborhood restaurant was just what we got. Split between two dining areas, we opted for the ""Bar Side"". A spacious area with a 15 seat bar and ample seating including both booths and tables. After being seated by the hostess we were greeted by a waitress almost immediately. The best part was, she had the hot bread on our table top before even asking for our drink order! I was in Heaven already. The beer selection was more than I expected. From locals to crafts, they had it all. If your a domestic beer drinker they have you covered as well. About 12 Beers on tap I chose the Buckeye IPA (Lakewood, Oh) We started off with a few Stuffed Peppers (4 for $8.50) and an order of Kale Sprouts ($5) Both came out in a timely manner and both dishes were amazing. I ordered the Chicken Parm ($11.50) Two large breaded breasts and a nice pile of penne paste. Let's just say It was enough to feed two. The service was phenomenal. Not only was our waitress on top of everything, and the manager was very helpful as well. For those who are saying this place is over priced?! I couldn't disagree more. Well worth the cost and we will be returning in the near future.",positive
"I am really impressed with their newer menu and chef. I've been in a few times this year already and I along with my bff are pleasantly surprised and happy with their changes that we will continue to support this local restaurant. The food is actually great. The wine prices are cheap and their brewed iced tea is always fresh. They have the best calamari in the city- never overdone. I Love their raspberry dressing on the arugula pear salad and the Italian wedding soup. My bff usually orders the mesculin salad with a side of chopped grilled chicken. Mmm...the warm bread is delicious. Service is friendly and fast and the place is clean. That's important to us because we eat out a lot. We've had the calzones and they are large and hearty, usually enough to take home. The gnochi is fantabulous. Their flash fried kale is good and different but a little greasy.",positive
"The restaurant was clean and well organized ! However the food was way below average ! Pizza was oily and the crust was tasteless. Honestly I don't understand the high reviews here ! The service was very bad and unacceptable, the waiter was best conversation killer ever ! All we heard from were ( yes / no / ok) he wasn't welcoming at all and not happy serving us, Not coming back there and will not suggest to a friend",negative
"The first time I experienced Pizzazz on the circle near JCU I was invited to a party in their downstairs 'Jake's Speakeasy'. it was a great venue for a party - plenty of space, bar seating and tables. Overall a nice laid back atmosphere... the food was tremendous and the party was a blast. My girlfriend and I decided to go back for dinner with another couple. I went with the Stuffed Gnocchi Abruzzi (amazing) and my friend went with a chicken parm. He loved it ! My girlfriend, being a finicky eater, was thrilled that the menu was not limited to just pizza; she had the Cajun Chicken Salad which was impressively fresh, not to mention Pizzazz's famous Italian salad dressing, which is great. This has become a regular spot for us, and will continue to be for takeout and dining in.",positive
This place is an old family favorite. Every so often we have a dinner gathering here. The food is awesome. I love the open kitchen. The bar side is a great place to sit with friends and enjoy the game while the dining room side is a nice place for family dinning. I attended a friends work party in the basement party center/bar which was really nice too. Go for the Cajun chicken salsa pasta. Switch the pasta to cavatelli. The pizzas and salads are great too!,positive
"My partner and I had spaghetti with olive oil and fresh tomatoes and were not terribly impressed. The pasta was way overcooked and the dish looked drab and was kind of tasteless. Over all, we felt the place was just going through the motions of trying to stay afloat as a business; there was little joy in the service, interior decor or presentation of food. It reminded us of a candidate for an episode of a restaurant-salvation TV reality show, although the place was reasonably busy. Maybe the pizza is a draw, but I had it several years ago and it was only okay.",negative
"Great selection of draft beer especially for such a small place. Definitely better selection of beer than that ""speakeasy"" place downstairs (HA! found you sucker via wifi network). Mech, pompous bartender down there for a such a low rundown bar. I got the El Diablo specialty pizza and added pineapples on it. Spicy advertised. Spiciness denied... well for the most part. The pizza is a bit watery. Not cool especially for those who love to eat with their hands. All the waitresses, presumably college girls with John Carroll University next door, wear spandex pants and black v-necks. Yea yea yea, some eye candy you suppose, but not really. You have to see my girlfriend with hers on. I know, iBrag. 4 for beer. 2.5 for food. You can't budge me for a 4. Sorry!",negative

"The diablo sauce is a little spicy, if you like that. The servers have always been friendly here, and the food has always been good.",positive
"This is our standby for the nights that we don't feel like cooking. We get the same things every time because they're solid and delicious: Hot wings. They seriously have some of the best wings in CLE. Pepperoni pizza, thick crust, with diablo sauce (its a must if you like things spicy) Grilled chicken salad - I don't know how a restaurant manages to make such good salad, but the fresh ingredients are always perfect. We always get takeout. The staff is mostly young high school and college girls...and definitely leaves something to be desired in terms of service. Can't go wrong with carry out though.",positive
"We recently moved to the cleveland area and we went to this restaurant. We were sat but a waitress never came so we had to go back to the hostess area and ask for a waitress, turns out the waitress that finally came over was the one who saw us sitting there 15 minutes ago but she said she didnt know we were there, the calamari was horrible and the pizza so so soggy I couldnt pick it up to eat it and there was sitting water under my pizza, then of course I had to go and get my own napkins to sop up the mess because the waitress was so unattentive. We will not be going back.",negative
"Pizzazz This is a place that I believe to be a bit overrated, however the close spatial proximity to JCU makes it an obvious option for students. I always just had the thin crust pizza when I went here. One time my roommate ordered a salad that said it came with some meat topping. This salad came out with three of the smallest pepperoni slices that I have ever seen. We were all laughing. Another time I saw my psychology professor repeating, verbatim, our lecture to try to impress some middle age woman. Something like, ""Your smell is driving my limbic system wild."" Again I was laughing my ass off.",positive
"I used to hang out at Pizzazz all the time growing up. I loved their chicken salad. But that was like 15 years ago. I recently went back and discovered that yes, the chicken salad is still just as good. What consistency! I can't explain to you what is so delicious about this simple chicken salad. It's just iceberg lettuce with grilled chicken, grape tomatoes, black olives, shredded provolone, and house italian dressing. All I can surmise is that the secret is in the house dressing. And the cheese is wonderfully moist, unlike most dry shredded cheese on salads. I vaguely remember that their pizza is good too, but really, this review is for the chicken salad.",positive
"First thing is First. The dinner salad. My friends and I can never resist ordering the dinner salad when we come here (which used to be more often when we went to John Carroll). Usually by the time you get through the cheese, it is kind of hard to eat the rest because I swear they use half of a block of grated cheese. I have really never been disappointed here. Sometimes the service can be a little rude, but they are usually pretty busy so that is understandable. Word of advice to anyone that likes Irish Car Bombs but you dont feel like paying $8 at another bar, you can get one here for a mere $5 and they are usually pretty big. Warning, you may get wrapped up in the fact that the shots are not that expensive, and the next thing you know, huge bar tab. But then again, the only people who use this as an actual bar opposed to a restaurant is my group of friends.",positive
"The Pizzazz Salad is to die for. I'm also a big fan of their chicken sausage. It's great alone or on a pizza with red peppers and artichoke hearts. They can get pretty busy, but the staff is very nice. It's a great place for a date or a family dinner.",positive
"For all the amazing food Cleveland has to offer, pizza is not its strong point. The standards are particularly low, and the pickings are slim. That said, this is one of the better pizza places out there in the greater Cleveland area. The pizza is good, if not particularly interesting. It doesn't have any objectionable qualities: it's not too greasy, not too salty, and it's a step up from any of the mainstream pizza chains. The atmosphere is very snazzy for a pizza place...sleek, modern, but in a classy sort of way. It's a spacious place too, and can usually accomodate very large groups without much trouble. When I lived in Cleveland I wouldn't eat much pizza but if I were in the mood for it, I would never object to going to this place.",positive
"Wow. Chop salad, shrimp tempura tacos (like NOBU in Malibu) and the Side of Mac & cheese (I'm from the south, Mac and cheese snob, best I've ever had in a restaurant-get the side, not the fancy fixings) sooooooo good. Visiting from NYC for a cousins wedding and found this gem! Plus, the staff was Incredible-if I lived here I'd be here every day!",positive
"First timer, and this place rocks. Can't wait to go back. Get the pretzel app. Get the tacos. Get the Mac & Cheese. Everything is great.",positive
Pub Frato is a local favorite! Pretty much everything is great and hands down the cod fish tacos are a fan favorite. Great drink selection and atmosphere. Love their brunch too! Make sure to make a reservation or get there early because they fill up quick!,positive
"A well deserved 5 stars for Pub Frato! We started with the pretzel appetizer which came out piping hot with a delicious pub cheese and mustard sauce. Each were excellent. Our entrées included a burger, cubano and buffalo tacos. A+ all around. The server was attentive, friendly and helpful. Definitely headed back!",positive
Excellent food and service. Fun variety of tacos. Tried the tempura shrimp and beef. Both top notch. Very attentive and pleasant service.,positive
Good food and service. Their tacos and burgers are delicious. I would say their food is gourmet bar food. Always like coming here! Highly recommend!,positive
"I should say that I consider myself a foodie. I travel quite a bit for work and get to experience all sorts of cuisine. Well let me say this - my wife and I moved into the neighborhood about 30 days ago. Today I stopped here on a whim for lunch... all I can say is wow! The atmosphere is amazingly clean, sophisticated, and classy! I was really impressed. After making a few choices from the menu, our food came out... 1 word... WOW!! I now live 1 mile from here and will be a frequent flyer!!! Tacos and sandwiches were our choice during trip 1! 5 stars!! Nice work Pub Frato!!!",positive
Love it! I guess I'm biased because it's within walking distance of my house? Hard to resist the prezel app and everthing on the menu is good. Drink specials on Thursday nights too! Us hospital workers love to call in our lunches and have it ready when we get there :),positive
First time at Pub Frato. Great selection of drinks. Friendly service. Ordered the excellent Brisket sandwich with truffle fries. Highly recommend it.,positive
"My husband and I were expecting to love this place as much as other yelp reviewers did and as much as we typically like a place with this kind of style. We were disappointed based on such high expectations, but if we would have gone in to Pub Frato with a lower expectations, I suppose we may not have been as disappointed as we were. We enjoyed the drinks we ordered and the selection of cocktails, drafts, and bottled drinks. We also liked our artichoke app, and the pub sauce on the wings was amazing. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his pub burger, but i was disappointed with my meal of buffalo chicken tacos with a side of fries. I love a buffalo-chicken-anything, and this had a bit more of a bbq flavor.... maybe it was the cole slaw or something? The side of ""hand cut fries"" that were plated with my meal were like someone scraped the bottom of the fryer basket for the little crispy broken fries that didn't make the cut; especially when compared to the normal serving that came with my husband's. Our main disappointment was with the service. We consider ourselves pretty laid-back diners, and we have both worked in food service and have an understanding for what makes service appear slow for diners, at times; there was no excuse for the slowness of our service at the bar. We would try to make eye contact with our bartender to order something, and she'd pass by, maybe five times, until we eventually had to call to her.... when she would pass by, it wasn't because she was busy making drinks, taking an order, or checking on someone, etc, but because she was just leisurely strolling around, looking at her watch, chatting with other servers, etc. The other servers hung out under the spiral staircase most of the evening chatting, and would depart every once in a while to check on a table here or there. I can only assume this is normal. Menu: 5 stars Food prep: 4 stars Service: 2 stars.",negative
"When staying in Concord this has become our go-to place for good quality food and drinks. Admittedly the competition isn't great in the area, but Pub Frato could compete anywhere. It's a gastro pub so the food quality is several notches above a normal sports bar, and the menu is constantly being tweaked. The decor and atmosphere is about as cool as one can get in a shopping center. (Speaking of a shopping center, this happens to be located in a newer shopping center which itself has nicer curb appeal than most). The food is delicious and consistent. If you're going on Taco Night (Tuesday) be prepared to wait or see if they will let you reserve a table for larger tables. The tacos are great but hungry people will require at least 4 or 5 to feel full so keep that in mind (they're small in other words). Of special note are the parmesean truffle fries. They are the best around. Our entire family goes there just for them. I am gluten-free and while they don't have a special menu or a separate prep area, the staff is always knowledgeable and they'll work with you. I've also never had any digestive issues after eating there. (That being said, it's 2016 so it's probably time for management to mark gluten free items on the menu or at least have a separate paper menu to help the newer servers.) If you're in the area, this is the place to eat for upscale pub dining.",positive
"An excellent local restaurant with a nice, varied selection of dishes. The beer is good, the food is tasty, and the atmosphere is excellent. Always a great dinner date.",positive
"Don't pay extra for the truffle fries. I used to love them, but they changed the way they make them, and according to the waiter, it's staying that way. We were very disappointed!",negative
"Went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers. We had called three weeks prior to make the reservation and an employee called the day before to confirm our reservation and number of guests. We were also told at this time, that they would need to make room for another small party at 6:00, but we could still have several tables. The night started off ok, but it was obvious that the restaurant can't handle large groups. We asked about specials and were told by one server that the restaurant doesn't have any specials. This was clarified after we all placed our first order. We had to wait for drink refills and several people from our party never got their meals. Our server did the best job she could, but lacked additional help. At one point, she put her hand up to us and asked us to wait. It was obvious she was frustrated. Then, we were told we had to move because the restaurant had additional reservations, so we stood at the bar where service was still lacking. The food and drinks were good, but I was not impressed with the service and the way we were treated.",negative
The service is off the chain good. If you get Michelle thats a great start. Order the Montréal poutine...with the fried egg. You wont be disappointed. The braised brisket and cod tacos will knock your sox off. Will definitely be back. Tuesday you can mix up your taco order. Definitely a must try!,positive
Great place. It's small so seating can be difficult but totally worth it. The buffalo chicken sandwich is awesome. My wife loved the buffalo chicken mac-n-cheese. Our friends both ordered the smoked brisket patty melt and it was fantastic. Great menu. It's small and not overwhelming. Everything we've tried has been good. Great beer selection as well. Highly recommend.,positive
This place is phenomenal. Was staying at the Quail Hollow Resort for a wedding and a group of us were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch. Couldn't have picked a better spot. Staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. Had the chicken tacos which were delightful. Friend had some sort of grilled cheese sandwich that looked amazing. Great selection of local beers as well.,positive
"In response to Lydia's comment; I've been here countless times and I love it. However, I've had my fair share of disappointments at this establishment ( 3 separate occasions), and the common denominator has been that general manager. Always left a bad taste in my mouth. I give this three stars because my last experience was with Alexa, and she was amazing!",negative
"Great place! I have the buffalo chicken sandwich with slaw on top and my wife had the risotto with scallops. Both dishes were fantastic and perfectly prepared. For dessert I had the not your fathers root beer float, and holy sh!t was it good. The atmosphere was great in this place, very modern.",positive
We have eaten here twice. We have been lucky enough to get seats at the bar because most of the tables are reserved. We prefer to sit at the bar anyways. The place seems to fill up quickly on weekends. They have a nice beer selection but the food is why I come here. The pot roast pierogies are awesome and if my mom made brussel sprouts like this place I would have eaten them all the time. The staff is very friendly and attentive.,positive
"Food is amazing, staff is sooo friendly and beers are great. Such a great addition to the Concord area. Reservations needed on weekends, but a great place to go for a beer. Best dishes we've had are the Poutine (currently not on the menu), salads, fish tacos, burger, wings, and perogies. Just a nice change of pace from the Red Hawk/Panini atmosphere. We would be ""regulars"" if we didn't have kids! :)",positive
This was a great place to eat. The look and fell of bar is modern country feels. Using a reclaimed design feel. The only complaint I had was not enough sausage on the stuffed peppers. They were still good. I had the kielbasa sandwich. Was really good. To many flavors going on but good. My girlfriend at burger and wedge salad. She was so happy with flavor and juiciness of burger. The staff was nice fun and outgoing. All and all I would go back.,positive
"We go here all the time, probably the best restaurant in the area. Mentor is the capital of terrible chain restaurants so it's a relief to have Pub Frato. The beer selection is great and the food is awesome!",positive
Really good beer selection. Really noisy but it was a saturday. Pub burger on point. Subpar service but oh well. Oh really good salad too. Would come back.,positive
"Five stars for food!! Amazing food, and drinks! -1 stars for the blonde hostess. Had to greet her when we walked in and ask if we just seat ourselves. She told us no it's full till 8:30. Not apologetic or anything. Worst Coustomer service I've come across in a while. Pub Frato please hire someone with manners!!!!",positive
Had dinner here last night and the first thing that I noticed it was a very small place that was packed with people. It took about 20 minutes before a table opened up and we were seated. The selection of beer is outstanding. I had the golden Belgium Monkey as well as fish and chips for dinner. Both were good and highly recommended. Service was also outstanding.,positive
Stumbled upon this place. Great drink specials. Most importantly this place had the best hot soft pretzel I've ever had. And that's saying a lot.,positive
"We stopped in here with some friends unbeknownst to us they had already had dinner, therefore my wife and I had to grab something to eat while they were drinking. However the evening started with us at the bar, waiting for the table which is fine with me. I started out with two cousins draft beer which must be somewhere around 50% alcohol because they hit me like a rock! The bartender was able to transfer our tab over to the table which is not a common practice but I tip to the bartender anyway. Once we got your table we have 3 or 4 more beers and ended up ordering some light snacks. After all this place is not known for large heavy meals and the whole light snack motif is apparent. Now I have been to bars before that had a Tater Tot obsession and when you order tater tots they serve you mountains of tater tots topped with every bit of cheese and bacon it seems Northeast Ohio has to offer. However when we ordered tater tots here what we got was much different than what I was expecting. What we received, although delicious, was five tater tots. 5. The tater tots were just a little larger than normal and they appeared to be handmade and came with a couple different dipping sauces. However I wish the menu would have said hey you going to get just five tater tots with this. It was easily remedied by ordering another round of tater tots, but I just kind of wish they would have disclosed that it was not your normal Northeast Ohio mountain of tater tots. Our server was attentive, easy to flag down, table was cleaned off, and the check was brought promptly when we when we asked for it. Overall it was a really enjoyable night but I think they are too maybe include some pictures in their menu.",positive
"To start, we are from Chicago. One of the great food hubs of the US. We went here while visiting family and Pub Frato was a GREAT experience! First let me say the service was IMPECCABLE. Everyone was friendly and attentive and LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE. The beer selection and bar specials we fantastic! $1 bottle beer is un heard. We started with the charcuterie plate and everything was as good as it could be. We also got the pretzel...wow was that good. The white cheese sauce I could of taken a few shots of! For the main course we got shrimp tacos, braised short rib tacos and the pub burger. The shrimp tacos were flavorful and the shrimp were plump and well cooked. The burger as perfectly done with bacon and a runny fried egg, yum! The best was the braised short rib tacos... HOLY COW! They were absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and the goat cheese on them added some acidity which it needed because the meat was so rich! Great meal! Overall this place deserves every bit of 5 stars. Whomever wrote previous reviews with 1 star must of came right when they opened because there was absolutely nothing I did not like about the place and would recommend it to anyone!",positive
"In the last few weeks, have been here once for lunch and once for dinner. Menu is well-edited. Salmon was perfectly cooked, crisp on outside and still moist inside. BLT was great, made with a tomato mix instead of slices, very good. Pretzel appetizer was fantastic. Only complaint was that our table was near door and every time someone walked in, we were blasted with cold air.",positive
"Red Lobster is a classic seafood place to bring your family to. The food is always consistent in its quality and tasted great on my experience. The food price was also affordable and my family enjoyed eating at Red Lobster. One knock that I had about this establishment was that it took long for the food to come and it took a while for or drinks to get refilled. If they can work on their service, this can definitely be a spot where I would regularly go to eat meals with my family for special occasions!",negative
"Wanna Laugh? My husband and I go here with another couple where everyone proceeds to order THE NEW YORK STRIP STEAK! I think to my self,why in the world did we come to Red Lobster for them to eat steak? I naturally order fish! Right? It only seems right! Our dinners are served promptly, with a smile. I look at my shrimp and I look at their steaks, I look back at my shrimp and realize I was the one that ordered incorrectly. My husband was nice enough to share his perfectly medium rare steak with me. It was as good as any high end steak house. Moral of the story you ask? Red Lobster has better steaks then coconut shrimp! Go Figure!!!",positive
"I used to go to Red Lobster in Florida all the time and decided to give it a try here in Las Vegas! It was so good! I got a shrimp Caesar salad as an appetizer. My shrimp was so crunchy!!! And the size was huge. Then as a main dish I got a big sampler of fried shrimp, shrimp Alfredo and baked shrimp. It was excellent and so big that you can share it with your partner. And of course the famous Red Lobster bread! It's a legend. The service was very fast and friendly. And the prices are fair. Can't wait to come back.",positive
"Came in for my girlfriends birthday! Took a while to be seated (it was a Saturday night) anyway upon being seated I noticed we were super close to the restroom. No biggie until I noticed there were other tables that could accommodate our party closer to the front. The waiter was friendly but I can tell new. He didn't refill our drinks until after our dinner arrived (I asked him to do so) and never checked on us except to bring the check, take the order, and bring out the appetizers. When I asked him about singing happy birthday he did wish her a happy birthday but I had to remind him because he had already closed out the check and was ready to be done with us! The appetizers were delish, the salad was crisp, but my steak was cooked medium well when I asked for well done! Very pink and a little runny. My girlfriend had crab legs and let's just say they were a little to not so good. Never been to this location before but definitely wouldn't think of going back. I asked to speak with a manager and he/or/she took forever to come out. We just payed the bill and left. Not a great birthday for her sorry baby.",negative
"A couple of weeks ago we visited this Red Lobster location for the all you can eat shrimp special. As we expected for a Friday night at 5:30, the wait time was 20-minutes. I think because of where we were seated, we did not have the best customer service experience. Our server was pleasant and helpful. But because we were off in a corner and it was busy, it took a long while for a dish to come out. When it did and as we watched, our dinner 'floated' around the restaurant for a little bit until this other server noticed that we didn't have any food and by reason of elimination, made the connection that it belonged to us with the explanation, ""all the servers help one another out. its so busy in the kitchen that when they call out the table numbers, they all run together so I can't really make out which table the food belongs to.' Thanks for admitting that, I think. So although the all you can eat shrimp was $17.99, the dishes are really greasy. As you get older, your digestive system can only handle so much grease. As my husband's patience was growing noticeably thin about the wait time and the few times our server had forgotten a few times to drop off something at our table, my husband chalked up the slow service to our server being ""forgettable"". I understand that people are working hard and I commend them for it. I have no experience working in a restaurant. But as a patron, I have experienced fabulous customer service in extremely busy environments. So I do expect with coaching, one can improve their customer service skills, especially in a very service oriented industry. So for this particular experience 2-stars. I hope to update it with a future visit.",negative
Setting here very disappointed in my ultimate feast the manager has nickeled and dimed this for everything at this location subpar food okay service we won't be back,negative
We just had the best experience ever at Red Lobster. Our server Roy made our experience so enjoyable we will be back just for him. His service was impeccable and went the extra mile to ensure we were taken care of. Someone in my party had trouble cracking the crab leg shells. Roy threw on a pair of gloves and started cracking for us. He stood there and got all the crab meat out for my guest. The food of course was great but it was Roy that had us bragging. Kudos Red Lobster on hiring just an amazing waiter. See you soon!,positive
I came in the other night with a couple friends and seriously had the best experience ever! Our server Jesus made it a fun and special night to remember. Hands down the best service I've ever received and all the food was delicious!.. and believe me I practically ordered a little bit of everything,positive
"best restaurant around this area! I love their crab cakes my waitress Michael was very attentive with my refills, the management seems ti know what they're doing",positive
"Went for a late birthday dinner last night and it was good, not great, but just good. I had the ultimate feast and the other half got the endless shrimp. The ultimate feast came with shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, lobster tail, and snow crab legs. Everything was just ok, nothing that really stood out or to remember but it took care of my seafood craving. I enjoyed the lobster and shrimp scampi the most. The other half really enjoyed the endless shrimp, it was his first time getting it and he put the term endless to the test. Our server was really nice obliged him. They have a new Korean bbq shrimp which was really good also. All in all a good visit and a good meal. If you can eat a lot of shrimp i suggest to go for the endless shrimp promotion while they have it!",positive
"great food and fivevstar service from roy, that man was on the ball drinks ready before we asked plates ready for our meal before it came out,and he even bagged up biscuts to take home way to go roy you made our dinning experince perfect.",positive
I always come to red lobster for lobster fest. Can't beat the lobster lovers dream. I also ordered the new dueling lobster plate. Absolutely delicious. I always make sure I have room for the stuffed mushrooms. That's a must try. My server Mary was so nice. All the workers are nice and polite. Definitely recommend this restaurant.,positive
"Had an amazing server ""Jesús "" he was very polite and always made sure we were happy throughout our meal, couldn't ask for anyone better :)",positive
"Red Lobsters will always remain on my low budget seafood places because it's just the quality! Once you eat at 5 star seafood restaurants like Mastros Ocean Club, and then eat at red lobsters then you will understand where I'm coming from! Not to come off snobby or anything but bottom line I just don't ever have great experiences here! My mom for whatever reason loved Red Lobsters and selected this location for her birthday lunch! First hiccup was the Caesar salad that came out with the wilted lettuce, Second was the steak that I ordered with the whole surf and turf new dish my waiter recommended. The steak was ordered medium and came out WELL and dry, Third I asked for cheese on my baked potato and it came out with three strings of cheese? Smh don't believe me look T the pics attached! Management got involved and addressed my concerns accordingly hut geeze it was a train wreck. This experience validated my initial issues I stated in the beginning and is the reason I don't come here.",negative
Their lobster tacos are delicious and the staff is very friendly. The restaurant is clean and smells good. I enjoy coming to dinner.,positive
"Went there last night with the husband. Was seated right away. The food was delicious. Lobsterfest is going on so I ordered the ultimate feast and it was terrific. Loved the shrimp and lobster fettuccine Alfredo, it was so good. Also came with 2 lobster tails that where equally as good. My husband had the surf and turf and he really liked the stuffing in his lobster tails and said his steak was really good too. Can't leave out the warm garlicky cheddar biscuits, they are the best. Will definitely be going back again soon.",positive
"I have visited red lobster many time but have not been that satisfied but today the food was off hook, meaning fantastic and the customer service was very prompt and the waitress was very polite. Best Birthday present ever...thanks hunny for taking me!",positive
Just walked out of this red lobster on flamingo and eastern they sat us down and no one even acknowledge us so we walked out never to return,negative
Tonight I had the grilled lobster shrimp and salmon And a mean lobster tail jumbo shrimp skewer salmon green beans and baby gold potatoes. Who hasn't been to red lobster? It's always good. Fresh seafood is not a bad way to go. We went about an hour before closing and the restaurant was empty. Every other time I've been it's always packed so this was a nice change of pace tonight. Service was great as well.,positive
"Ok,been going to this Restaurant for years,And haven't been dating for the last two years,started talking to this man on the internet a couple months ago.We met there Friday the 20th of February,he brought me a dozen red roses,since we was having such at great time at our first meeting,I forgot the flowers there after dinner we went somewhere esle ok Monte Carlo to be exact,I drove so after leaving Monte carlo he asked where is the red roses I brought you for our first date,I said oh my gosh I must have left them at Red Lobster,tried to call them but they where closed,so the very next morning I called at 11am,Here's my thought any establishment that you leave something at you should have at least 24 hours to claim whatever it may be,well talked to a lady employee there the next day which was Saturday and have called the manager twice no one has returned my calls,I also spoke to the manager tonight March 3 2015,he informed me he has to speak with Julie says it's his boss, and by the way the night in question I ordered a 3lb Lobster just boiled or steamed and they brought me a over cooked stuffed lobster that was horrible,but didn't want to complain because after all it was my first date after speaking to this gentelmen for two months getting to know him,there will be no second date.Want to ask you guys out here on the internet do you agree you should have at 24 hours to claim anything you leave at any Restaurant or Bar any estalblishment no matter what the item is please response on my Facebook if you agree at Vickie lynn martinez Thank You Looking forward to responses",negative
"OK so Red Lobster is classic as I have been eating at this establishment since I was a kid since the 80's. This is the spot for celebrations of birthdays and such for us, maybe two or three times a year. This last visit was a treat for my birthday and my first time at this location. I usually visit the location on Decatur as it is closer to home. Anyhow, I am boring, I always order the same dinner, the seaside trio which is shrimp linguini, fried shrimp and shrimp scampi. I am a shrimp eater, what can I say? Mmmmm all of that buttery scampi juice going wild in my mouth, it was truly welcome and delectable. The service was great, the food was delicious as always and pretty much what we always expect. Although I had to work off the calorie intake from this meal with three sessions, it was well worth the splurge. If you have eaten at RL before than you know what it is all about, if not than check it out.",positive
"Great experience overall. I normally don't take the time to write a review about a restaurant BUT this definitely deserved a 5 star rating. Our waiter was the best! He fulfilled all of our needs without us even needing to ask him. Very polite, quick service, and many refills. We made sure to tell the manager before we left that he was awesome. I wish I could remember his name though. The food never disappoints either. The second time I have come to this location and left happy and full.",positive
"Our bartender Krystal, was surprisingly personable, patient, helpful, and bubbly. The surprises continued throughout the crispy calamari with fried veggies, and my favorite, steamed snow crab legs. I'm not one for chains, but then I have to remind myself that these type places have grown into chains because of their success.",positive
The Ultimate feast was truly amazing. It was delicious and I basically ate the entire thing haha. My stomach is beyond full but it was worth it. My friend had the beer battered fish and chips and she said it was delicious. It looked really yummy. We had cheese sticks to start and they were pretty good as well!,positive
"Always a great place to eat. This I would say is my husband favorite restaurant. He is the kind of person that will find one thing and order it every time we go. I had just gotten off work so I was a bit tired but it was my idea to go. I went straight to the restroom when we got there. When I came out my husband had been seated right next to the restroom doors, with the sun shining right in our faces. Asked the little hostess girl to please close the blinds and she said wr would have to wait because there whee people sitting at the table where she needed to closed them at. (She had just seated the family). The mother must have heard me because she was the one to close them. Our waitress was good, I think maybe a little busy she seemed to be in a hurry. Our biscuit came out hot and fresh. She took our order and came right back with our salads. When our food came out about 15 min later wr could not eat. We had not silver ware at our table. We had to flag our waitress down. Me, I like to try new things. This times when we went it was lobster fest. My husband as always ordered the admirals fest and I decided to go with the lobster lovers dream. Not being a fan of green veggies so I opted for mashed potatoes. My rock lobster was good it melted in my mouth. My alfrado with shrimp and lobster was ok. To much shrimp and not the good kind. I would have taken a few Nice sized shrimp instead of three small salad shrimp they have me. When I finally got to my main tail lobster it was over cooked and rubbery. We will eat at red lobster again but I suggest going to the one on valley view and 215. Better cooks, better service and better food.",negative
"I'm a fan of Red Lobster and Seafood in general. The staff was very friendly and courteous. It was a pretty standard ambiance for the Red Lobster restuarant franchise which unfortunately isn't very impressive but lucky the food makes up for it. It wasn't very busy at this time so it would have been disappointing if it wasn't up to standards but it was so back to the good stuff. We got the Crab Linguini Alfredo, Rock Lobster Tail, Snow Crab Legs, and Garlic Shrimp Scampi... And everything was absolutely amazing! It was the kind of meal that put me right to bed after :)",positive
I have eaten here several times and the food has been very good. My last visit was different. I had the Sirloin steak w/ melted blue cheese. The steak and potatoes must have been under a heat lamp for a very long time. The steak was one of the worst I have had in a while. It was very tough and over cooked. The mashed potatoes had a crust over them (from the heat lamp?) On the plus side the server was good and funny.,negative
"red lobster was ok! The endless shrimp feast was decent but for some reason, it left me with after taste and hungry again a few hours later. Maybe im just not a seafood guy.",negative
"It was my mom's birthday not long ago, last month, and decided to go back for the 4 course meal for $15. Very well worth it AGAIN! It was my second time at this location and I liked it much better than the Red Lobster on Decatur. This restaurant was cleaner, had nicer decor and staff was more focused on welcoming you than shoving you at whatever table they could find. My selections for the limited time 4 course meal included, New England Clam Chowder, Caesars Salad, Scallop-Shrimp Alfredo pasta and the Chocolate Brownie a la mode instead of the Apple Frittata this time. This dinner of course came with the famous unlimited cheddar biscuits. The soup was creamy, not the best I've had, but I really enjoyed it. Now the salad was delish, just enough dressing, crunchy, crispy and fresh. Now let's talk about that pasta. The Alfredo sauce was 3x better than the Olive Garden! The shrimp and scallops were cooked on point. Very well seasoned, super creamy. I was kinda full and the waitress was super nice, she asked if I wanted my dessert packed to go! Not many places do that, you eat there or you miss out! I wanted my frittata warm so I opted to have it served. The apple frittata was small, in my opinion perfect size for an after dinner dessert. -This second time around the chocolate browny was not as good, it was chocolate extreme to me. I should of went for the the Apple Frittata again.- Most places that do the number course meals, as offers, tend to always give you smaller size, salads, smaller main courses, but NOT RED LOBSTER! Hurry up and grab some dinner, this special is limited and ending soon!",positive
"I have never been to Red Lobster up until this point in my life. I am 27. I never want to go back to Red Lobster ever again. I was whisked away to RL over this past weekend for a dinner birthday celebration for my brother. He wanted lobster, my parents immediately thought of RL. I really wish we had gone somewhere else. Everything in this place is salted beyond belief. I guarantee you they serve the food this way because they are catering to the general American public and the general American public have an overly iodized taste (in my opinion). I ordered one of their shrimp dishes, and selected the shrimp scampi and seafood stuffed shrimps. YUCK on both accounts. The shrimp ""scampi"" was coated in butter I'm very certain and it was horrendous. The stuffed shrimps were not any better. My salad came out slathered in ranch dressing (I should have asked for it on the side). The famous little cheddar bay biscuits were okay, but pretty dry. The rest of my family got dishes with lobster tails, and I did have a few bites of the lobster. It was good, but nothing spectacular. However, I really have never had amazing lobster. But I doubt I'll ever get it at RL. My favorite dish was the appetizer we ordered off of the ""build your own"" appetizer selection. We selected clam strips and mozzarella sticks. Well, it's pretty damn hard to mess up clam strips and I thought they were yummy. I think the mozzarella sticks could have been heated up a BIT more, but they were good none the less. Our waitress was very nice, good humored, and very quick. She kept our drinks filled and was an all around champ about getting our food and clearing our plates. However - it was definitely mentioned that my brother was having a birthday - and NOTHING! No complimentary dessert! Seriously, RL? That was just really disappointing. Needless to say I have no intention of ever returning to Red Lobster. If I'm going to throw down money on seafood it better be some effing good seafood and I know I'm not going to get it here.",negative
"We were doing the art show so we called in an order. I went in when she said it would be ready. Wasn't ready so I waited, she said it would be right out, I waited, she went to check on it, it wasn't ready. Three others picked up their order and I waited. Someone brought me an order, wrong one so, I waited. She checked and said it would be right out. Thirty minutes of waiting and our food was barely warm. Won't do that again.",negative
"Had the pleasure of eating here tonight. First, i should mention there was over 50 prom goers eating there tonight. SO THEY WERE SWAMPED. Staff killed it. Almost no wait. Everything we all ordered was incredible (chips, tuna, wings apps were all amazing. Salads as entrees, one of us added shrimp, the other steak). All great. Highly recommend this place!",positive
"Great food and patio area! I recommend visiting on a weekend to enjoy live music from the squares while enjoying a nice cocktail My Ahi Tuna and asparagus were cooked perfectly, and the sesame sauce added a sweet kick to the overall dish",positive
"OMG!!!!! I am absolutely beyond happy with their service. I originally went to another restaurant in the area only to find they were closed. I decided to go over to Red Rocks for dinner. My heart was set the ENTIRE day on the other restaurants fried pickles. I asked the waiter here and sadly they did not have any on their menu. Moments later one of the managers Kristen came out to my surprise with a bowl of fried pickles. (I could hear the angels singing in the background.... ) Even though the item was not on the menu they went out of the way to brighten the remainder of my day! I'm so thankful and blessed. I'll definitely be back! Great food, EXCELLENT service and staff!!! P.S. if you guys decide to add fried pickles to the menu please name them after me Mirisha's Fried Pickles.....",positive
"We went to RRC for a rehearsal dinner last weekend. It was fantastic!! All of the staff was wonderful!! We started with the crab cakes, chicken skewers, and vegetables. The crab cakes were delish! I had the filet and my husband had the seared ahi tuna. Both were spectacular! You could cut my steak with a fork. It was absolutely perfect! My husband loved his tuna. It was the perfect location for a rehearsal dinner! Thank you!!",positive
"Generally, we've had good experiences here. However, Easter Brunch was a train wreck. Prix fixe menu, which wasn't indicated anywhere on their site prior to making the reservation. Normally, not an issue, but since we'd had a big dinner planned at home, we just wanted a small meal and did not want to commit to a three course ordeal. Fine, we went with the flow. However, at 1:30 they were already out of deviled eggs, red velvet cake, and even the vanilla cake that wasn't on the menu and was offered as a substitute to the red velvet cake. Instead our only choice was 4 slices of chocolate cake. Our filet was horribly overcooked, salmon should have been advertised as sushi, and the replacement filet was equally overcooked and had no flavor whatsoever. Service was inept, no visible management, and we were there for over 2 hours. I would expect more from such a staple.",negative
"The environment here is great, staff very friendly and fun but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the food ...I got the almond crusted flounder and can probably say it was the worst seafood I have ever had prepared for me! It came with asparagus over rice which was mediocre given you can't really mess that up. My husband got the jambalaya which had a nice kick to it but once again just mediocre. I can say the dishes look nice when served, but they are not what I would expect for $30- $40 entrees. I did have a friend suggest the crab cakes if we ever go back so they must be one of the better dishes.",negative
"Went for a girls night out. Birkdale had live music which made the outside patio atmosphere super relaxing! It was extremely busy, but the service was still good. Our waiter understood we were there for just apps and drinks and came back multiple times for our drink orders. It is expensive, but going for apps and drinks was a good value! I would come back for this! We had the calamari, which was perfect! The pieces were thick and flavorful! We also had the artichoke crab dip that was served with tortillas and was delicious! This place is a must try!",positive
"I've been to Red Rocks at least 5 times over the past 6 months. I've been satisfied each time. Great food, excellent service, reasonable prices. The reason for only 4 stars is the last time hubby and I went for dinner they tried to seat us in a side room where there were TWO separate tables both apparently celebrating birthdays or some other event. I knew it would get loud and I requested to be seated elsewhere. Then, they took us to a booth on the other side where I noticed there were several empty booths. Why in the world would you try to seat a couple near 2 loud parties when you have several empty tables elsewhere? Other than that, RR rocks!",positive
"We've actually eaten here twice this weekend...once when it was very busy (Saturday) and again when it was not (Sunday). The service and food was exceptional on both occasions. Kylie and Jordan were friendly and knowledgable. The GM, Chris, talked with us on Sunday which was very nice as well. We will definitely make this a regular spot to enjoy!",positive
"Wow the quality has gone way down in the past few years. This is the first time I've been in for three years or so and my girlfriends and I were really underwhelmed with the food. They had Reubens and I had the Kobe beef burger. The server asked how I waned it cooked. I said medium rare and even said ""hot pink center."" When the burger came out it was well done. Since it was still juicy I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it, but when she came back she asked if all was good. I mentioned it and she offered to have the kitchen try again. We weren't in a hurry so I said sure. The second burger came out and was exactly the same, well done. She came back by and I told her not to worry, because it was still juicy. But it is weird to see a kitchen unable to hit close to a basic temp check. The spinach dip was not great, tasted microwaved and not very fresh. The Reubens were good but greasy, and our side salads were just okay. Especially since they charged $4 for it even tho we replaced our side dish with it, was expecting a 2 or maybe 250 up charge for something so simple. The Bloody Mary was great, and the server was a sweetie. The manager really needs to learn not to interrupt when a table is talking, apologizing after completely jumping in the middle of a sentence not once but two separate times did not endear him to us. Appreciate a manager dropping by but this one had an attitude and really has a problem with social cues. With so many other restaurants in Birkdale alone, we won't be back. Guess Red Rocks is on its way out.",negative
"First time at Red Rocks even though I have passed the restaurant several times shopping at Birkdale and have heard great things for a long time. It was restaurant week so I was able to try a few things. Appetizer I got the Caesar salad, which was good nothing special but the significant other got the She Crab soup which was amazing !! It just needed oyster crackers. Dinner we had the surf and turf and the herb baked chicken. The surf and turf was great ! The shrimp was great size and grilled perfectly and the filet was cooked perfectly as well! Very tender and the sauce was great as well. The herb chicken was flavorful and very tender but steamed vegetables were plain. Dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter cake, it was very good even though I'm not a chocolate cake fan. Wish I could've tried the red velvet cake in the dessert display. The atmosphere was very nice and intimate and the waiter was really great ! I can't wait to come back and try the normal menu ! Maybe the Danica Patrick Salmon !!",positive
"This was such a waste of money. Ordered the chicken formaggio pasta with a ""four cheese sauce."" The chicken was dried out, mushrooms looked canned or as if they had been soaking in water for hours, there was barely any ""sauce"" covering the pasta. Little cheese shreds that weren't completely melted as the ""sauce."" No flavor whatsoever. Meatloaf didn't taste like anything, veggies on the side were still partially raw. Pissed off about such poor quality food for $16 a plate. Paid less at Maggiano's and got 4 pasta plates, an appetizer and dessert. What a shitty place. Oh, and my fork had an old piece of dried out food in it.",negative
"We arrived at 5:30 pm for a 6:30 pm reservation. The valet said no problem come on in and eat. Then the hostess said: ""I'm sorry, but we have 1000 reservations tonight and we cannot seat you early."" I told her what the valet said and that they had already taken our car, so she sent someone out to speak with them and she seated us - in the cold corner of an outside room. No ambiance for New Years but more importantly no heat. After our food came out the manager came over to see how everything was. I hadn't started on my food yet, but told him it was cold. He stuffed napkins into the hole in the corner of the tent and said he would turn on the heat. Honestly for $100 meal with no tip (no alcohol either) I've had much better. The calamari was very standard without a lot of flavor. We both ordered the filet and crab cake. The filet was cooked medium (requested medium rare) and had little flavor. The crab cake was the right size and had lots of crab, but again little flavor - even with the sauce drizzeled on it. The green beans had salt and you could taste it and they were good. No dessert. I won't go back.",negative
Delicious chicken and biscuits. You can only get it for Sunday brunch. Good meal overall. Server was not thrilled to be working very obviously. Cute shopping area and if you can get a seat outdoors in the shade ask for extra ice ;) kids meals looked quite good.,positive
"Very good food except for the brunch buffet. The brunch buffet for Father's Day was not very good, with most of the food just cheap dried out breakfast items, yet it was very expensive. Not worth it at all. The normal food is great though! Love the seared ahi tune entree. It is the best I've had anywhere. All of the regular menu items I've tried there have been great.",positive
"We moved here 2 years ago and were excited to try this place. Let me start off by saying it is a beautiful restaurant, but I didn't go to look at it. It was very disappointing. The food is just mediocre, nothing special or even good about it for the price. We even tried it again about 6 months ago to give it another shot... Still disappointed and we both agree we won't return. It just makes me wonder how places like this stay open. I would suggest the chef try something at Alton's or even Choplins in Cornelius, the food is so much better!",negative
"I really liked my Red Rocks experience and I would definitely return and recommend it to others. I do agree with other reviewers who said that the meals are overpriced, however, all the food we ordered was excellent and the service was exceptional. My picky date mulled over his order and discussed options with our awesome waiter (hey Jonathan!) and settled on the Quattro Formaggio -- which is super delicious but rather heavy. (No complaints from him because he's carbo loading for a 15 mile training run). I had the pork chop which was SUPERB. The side of sweet potatoes almost makes the dish worth it on its own. For dessert we got carrot cake and peanut butter pie. Both were sugary perfection. Jonathan stayed and chatted with us after the meal was done. The vibe was nice and the service was super friendly. Definitely will return.",positive
"We went here because Bonefish had over an hour wait and Red Rocks has good reviews... Maybe we had a bad experience but the food was not good. I agree with other reviewers that the food is overpriced for what you get. My husband and I both had a surf n turf with filet and crab cake. The crabcake was the worst I've ever had! I'm from Florida and lived in DC so I know what a crab cake should taste like and it was all filler. And not good. The steak was comparableto outback but with a much bigger price tag. Our server was also very obnoxious trying to oversell bottles of wine and add ons to the steaks and more. We each had a glass of wine, no desserts and no apps it was over $100 for 2 of us and not worth it at all. The atmosphere is very chain-like and not upscale, the table next to us had loud children and were eating burgers... Maybe that's the way to go here? I might give them one more chance because we live close but steer clear of the crab cake and steaks.",negative
"Went here for lunch around a year ago and found it pretty good. Went back last November with 5 people for lunch and food was horrible.my wife & daughter had Kobe beef burgers which were both overcooked to death.my son-in-law had a fish salad which only the fish was edible, the lettuce was old. I had a salad which was just on! The waitress was horrible, waited 70 minutes for food to come out and then no one ate.left 2 burgers behind minus one bite each and a droopy salad for the price of $85.00.would have been better off at Burger King for $25.00.save your money, don't eat here.",negative
"This was the ultimate so-so meal. There were four of us in our party. We arrived at 11 am on a Saturday to celebrate a birthday with (what we thought would be) a tasty lunch. The highs were very high. The she crab soup is as tasty as I've had. Just the right amount of sherry to cream ratio- not easy to achieve. One person in my party also commented that the chicken salad was very good. The lows were so low. I had the BBQ chicken medallions. Yuck! Rubbery chicken slathered in what tasted like bottled sauce. I also had smashed potatoes and broccoli- both very poorly executed. Two in my party had the Mac n Cheese as a side and neither liked it. ""Bland"" ""Looks like they ran out of cheese"". Yet another ordered a medium-well burger and I'm pretty sure when she cut into it I heard the cow scream ""Ouch"". Medium at best. It has been my experience that if they can't cook a burger right other menu items will be sub-par as well. While the soup was very good, it could not rescue this meal from several culinary boo-boos. Red Rocks Cafe- Birkdale Village: C-",negative
"You have to get the Thai Mussels. High energy, swanky, modern and comfy restaurant. I've been to just about all the restaurants in this Birkdale Mall area and I think this place is the winner. The bar is fully loaded, lots of beer, and wine to choose from. The menu is interesting and will satisfy. I had their Almond Grouper and it was done very well. The creamy almond sauce compliments the white fish very well. I usually don;t go for desserts, but this place is famous for their cake. So I went with the Red Velvet and whoa.... it was worth every calorie..",positive
"The food was delicious. Service was so-so, but not terrible for a busy Friday night. Food is a little over priced for what you get, but it has a nice atmosphere",positive
"We chose to head over to Red Rocks for Charlotte Restaurant Week. While they didn't offer as many courses (just salad/soup, entree and dessert) the entrees really stood out and slapped us in the face. Plus it's one of the last restaurants at Birkdale that we haven't been to yet. I'm pretty dang happy with our decision to go here because it ended up being a great meal. We made reservations for 6pm on Saturday night. We were greeted quickly and shown to a table right away. I really liked the ambiance of Red Rocks...it's dark and quiet, and makes for quite the romantic/ intimate dining experience. All of the staff were friendly and courteous, and also knowledgeable on the menu details. We ordered some wine to go with our dinner and then prepared for the feast. The salads were both very good. I was a plain Jane and stuck with the caesar salad, but it was so good. The dressing was one of those extremely light caesars where it's almost the consistency of a vinaigrette and not a clump of heavy, creamy goodness. I was quite pleased with it, and there was plenty of shredded parm on top. The miss' had the baby field green salad which had some crasiens, goat cheese and other goodies all topped with a fruity vinaigrette. Both were light salads that were a great way to start the meal. I chose the Niman pork porterhouse as my entree. This thing was the real deal! It was a huge porterhouse pork chop, and it was COVERED with chunks of sauteed apple and bacon. The pork was cooked to a perfect medium and was so tender and juicy. The bacon that went with it actually gave the whole chop an overall hint of smoke that was awesome. And the bacon chunks were just that...CHUNKS! Not shriveled crunchy bits of bacon, but decent chunks of tender, fatty bacon. Those bacon bites, combined with the apple, really brought this dish home into flavor country. Then you have the sides. The sweet potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had. They were sooooo sweet and buttery, it was like biting into a marshmallow cloud. The whole dish was served on top of a bed of greens, which was initially a turnoff for me since I'm not a fan of sauteed greens. But those bitter greens really turned each porky bite into some kind of divine tastetacular experience. All in all, it was a huge portion of tasty food that is one of those meals I will remember for a long time. The miss' had the blackened tuna, and that was also just to die for. The tuna was cooked to a perfect rare, and was so tender and had that wonderful warm outside with cool inside. It was served over a bed of risotto which was just insane. The risotto was so rich and wonderfully tasty, and blew away most other sides I've had before. It also came with some asparagus that was cooked perfectly and had a light buttery taste to it. The one thing she didn't like was the avocado. I didn't try it myself, but she felt that the avocado didn't play well with both the tuna and the risotto. The tuna and avocado were good together, as were the tuna and risotto, but when combining the tuna, avocado and risotto there was just too much going on. After feasting on pork and tuna it was time to bring on the dessert. It sounded like each night would offer a different dessert option, and tonight we could choose from either a blackberry shortcake or bread pudding. We decided to get one of each and just share them equally, and there was more than enough dessert in the end for both of us. The bread pudding wasn't like bread pudding I'm used to. Rather than having chunks of bread that are baked it was like an actual pudding consistency, and was totally smooth all the way around and inside. It was strange for me at first, and I didn't like it as much right off the bat. However, once combining the bread pudding with the berry sauce and vanilla ice cream that garnish the plate, it was my dessert of choice. This thing was ridiculous, and if you go and see it on the menu, do yourself a favor and hit your server up with an order. The blackberry shortcake was also quite the tasty treat. They used two biscuits that were light and dry rather than buttery and sweet, and this really helped balance the dish out. These biscuits were smothered with tons of locally grown blackberries that the restaurant gets from a farm stand right down the road. On top of the berries is what I think was a kind of creme fraiche since it wasn't sweet like whipped cream. The biscuit, berries and creme all brought an awesome dessert to the plate, but it wasn't enough to topple the mighty bread pudding. Red Rocks is tentatively one of our favorite restaurants in the area. I think very highly of Alton's, and Red Rocks definitely competes with it as far as fanciness/ambiance goes. But the food at Red Rocks was slightly better, and definitely presented in a ""classier"" manner. I'll definitely want to return on a non-Restaurant Week day to sample the full menu before making a final judgement, but I guarantee we will be returning to Red Rocks soon.",positive
Stopped in for a drink last Saturday night. It did not live up to all of the hype. Too many inattentive servers standing around & socializing. Restrooms were filthy! Martinis were so-so for $10 a pop. I won't be rushing back anytime soon.,negative
"Red Rocks Cafe is a great place to eat when in Birkdale. The menu is eclectic with steaks, fish, appetizers and deserts. I really enjoy the blacked salmon. As for drinks, I usually enjoy a martini, followed by a nice glass of wine from the excellent by the glass wine list. The food is reasonably priced and the service is prompt and courteous. Will keep going back when in town.",positive
Seated immediately. Service excellent. Food excellent. Had the lobster ravioli. Barely finished my salad when the entrees arrived. No waiting for anything. Drinks were even refilled before empty. Server checked in regularly. 5 stars.,positive
"This place is in Birkdale Village, or as I like to call it, ""The Truman Show strip mall."" Typical suburban food with an obvious electrical problem - It is, without a doubt the DARKEST place I've ever eaten. I think the owner must have gotten the ""conserve energy"" memo. I went to the bathroom and it took me 10 minutes to find my seat. I felt like Mr Magoo. I don't know about you, but I like to be able to SEE my food before I eat it. Do yourself a favor & go the Fox & Hound across the street. The food there is fine, plus, they paid their electricity bill.",negative
"I've only been once, but it was a wonderful experience. I had the NY strip steak and I had to say it was the best steak I've ever had. I'm not a meat connoisseur, but I know what tastes good and this was very good. The service was wonderful and the setting is very nice. I would highly recommend this place.",positive
"I have been here twice so far during holiday visits from California. I like the fact that they have a full bar and the baby field greens salad is also good, especially with grilled chicken. (Salmon is also an option) The salad consists of spring greens topped with fresh goat cheese, roasted pine nuts (they were not roasted last time I was here), craisins, and served with balsamic vinaigrette. The perfect size for lunch. My dad liked his chicken salad sandwich and fries. My mom's crabcake sandwich looked just ok. Very pre-fab. Service is pretty friendly... can get VERY loud and busy on certain nights. Even the Xmas music was too loud when we were here at about 2pm on a Monday. I'm all about a party but.... c'mon now. I can't say that I""d be running to go back here but there are a couple things on the menu that are okay.",negative
"Best sushi in Calgary, possibly Alberta. Excellent rotating specials with unusual and interesting offerings are always worth a look on the menu board. It's always worth coming early before certain items sell out. Service is prompt, efficient and kind but could never be called overly friendly. You come here for the wonderful cuts of fish on top of warm, perfectly seasoned and textured rice. I've been a fan for some time and continue to drive the two hours round trip from Canmore and back or drop in whenever I'm headed to Edmonton.",positive
"Called ahead and made a reservation for Omakase, Chef prepared an excellent selection. All sushi, sashimi, etc was fresh and of the highest quality. The atmosphere sitting at the sushi bar was great as well. They make some amazing food here! It was a pleasure to watch each creation. Thanks so much Roku can't wait to come back.",positive
"Excellent sushi place. We have been here a few times, and not only that its close to our place but it's a finer dining restaurant with a great selection of a la carte sushi. Love the Midori salad and the rainbow and house special rolls. It is our place to go for Jspanese!",positive
"We decided on a late lunch at this popular Japanese restaurant in Royal oak after it was closed for a special function the last time we went. After hearing some great reviews, I was excited to try! Atmosphere: 4/5 The restaurant is not very big but neat and modern with a good decor and ambience. It can get busy, but since it was the end of the lunch hour, we were seated quite quickly. There is the option to sit at the bar or tables. It is conveniently located in royal oak mall with plenty of parking. Food: 4.5/5 I love the variety of fishes and dishes here! We went with the tofu salad, tuna avocado no goma ae, udon, and ordered white tuna, salmon, and unagi sushi a la carte. There were so many options regardless of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, rice bowls, or grill / entree items. Perfect portion size, fresh fish, and tasty salads without too much dressing. I love the big piece of unagi in the sushi! Service: 4/5 Efficient and friendly service. Price: 3/5 Reasonable Overall: 4/5 Really great Japanese restaurant with a comfortable ambience and many delicious options on the menu. I would definitely return to try some of their other fish.",positive
"I was in town for two days and both of those days I had dinner at Roku (I had to come back). Not only did they have fresh fish but also their portions were absolutely worth the bang for your buck. We ordered the gyu tataki to start and it was tender and the ponzu sauce really packed some flavor. We also ordered the salmon, salmon belly, and toro nigiri and this is where you really get the bang for your buck. The fish portion of the nigiri was more than generous and just melts in your mouth. The house special roll, chop chop roll, and negitoro roll were standardly made but nothing short of satisfying when it comes to the freshness of their ingredients. What I really appreciated the most other sushi restaurants don't do is that for the larger rolls they offer half orders, which encourages variety. We also had an order of the sweet shrimp (botan-ebi) and my favorite part is that once they take the heads off of the shrimp, they have the option of frying it up for you and let me tell you, that shrimp head tastes EXACTLY like those shrimp chips you get from the Asian market. It's sooooo crispy and a nice little treat with all the raw fish. Last but not least, the star of the night would have to be the green tea panna cotta. Just wow. I honestly came back for the dessert. I've had plenty of panna cotta and plenty of green tea flavored things but this was something I have tried for the first time. It wasn't too sweet but the little dollop of whip cream does help the dish out and a little hand from the ball of red bean (is what I believed it to be) was the perfect amount of sweetness. It was both rich but not overwhelming sweet; I loved it. The service was very friendly both times I visited and overall I would definitely come back and back and back again when I am in the area.",positive
"I came here with my family for dinner for the first time but left disappointed. I was hoping to find another sushi place in this quadrant of the city to love, especially after seeing all the good reviews. We either went on an off day for them or the quality is going downhill. The service wasn't too great as we were basically ignored after placing our order and the waitresses weren't too attentive or friendly. We got a few giant rolls, a couple maki rolls, assorted tempura, and breaded oysters. The tempura was fresh and lightly battered, which was nice but nothing to write home about. Our rolls came next and that was where things started to go wrong. The hamachi was super fishy. I flagged down a waitress and told her about it, to which she asked me what I wanted her to do about it. I asked her what she could do for us and she offered to have it remade for us. A smaller serving of hamachi rolls came to our table and it was still super fishy so it was definitely not fresh. The other rolls were mediocre, not really flavourful or delicious although my mom complained that everything with fish in it was fishy. The breaded oysters were overcooked so they were dry and very chewy. At least they weren't fishy. Overall, we can't say we really enjoyed our meal which ended up being quite pricey. Most likely won't visit again, especially not for sushi.",negative
"Roku is fantastic at one thing - making their food taste fresh. I'm not completely blown away by the overall flavours or the service for that matter, but this is actually really good sushi for a relatively decent price. The hamachi is godlike by the way. Highly recommend.",positive
"Probably one of the most authentic and best sushi places in town if you are looking for the ""real"" deal. Place has very limited sitting so it's best to book in advance unless you are willing to wait. The dinner combos are the best bang for the buck. Loved Chef's sashimi assortment.",positive
"Honestly, one of the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. But PLZ MAKE A RESERVATION! It's a small place that is very popular. Their beef tataki, tacoyaki and udon are my favourite. Other plates are pretty good too. Clean and organized place",positive
"Was super excited to try this place out after hearing that it was authentic, but after trying a few items: sushi, tonkatsu, and tuna, I didn't find that it was anything special. I thought it would have a while difference flavor compared to other Japanese restaurants I've been to owned by Chinese. Other that the food, the atmosphere was nice and the service was excellent.",negative
"Decided to try this neighbourhood resto as I've heard so many great reviews. Service was attentive. Sushi was fantastic. Melt in your mouth salmon that was the right temperature. Cool but not cold or frozen in my mouth. Rice was perfectly fluffy without too much vinegar. We tried the chicken karaage, tempura shrimp to start. Both were tasty, very crispy and lightly seasoned. A big bonus as I hate my food over salted. I had red tuna, unagi (BBQ eel), hokkigai (surf clam) sushi and red tuna and salmon sashimi. So tender and perfect! Followed by spicy tuna roll and California roll. Good size portions for sure. We will definitely return here again to try more items. The appies are extensive so I'm sure you could make a meal of it and they also have set menus for 2 or 3 people which takes the selection process out. Desserts look great so next time!",positive
Terrible service. Went in once saw lots of seating and told us it was an hours wait. Came another time and the server poured coke all down my daughters back and apologized to my other daughter for dropping her coke. Still made us pay for the coke. Will never go back again!! Had to give a star to post review doesn't even deserve that.,negative
"Tried out a lunch special (sashimi with izakaya in a bento box, served with rice, miso soup and a small salad). I was impressed with the freshness, flavour, and presentation. The ambience is lovely, the service exemplary, and our meal was great value for money, something not to be taken lightly in a struggling economy. We'll be back!",positive
"I dropped in here with hubby for lunch at 11:30am--we were greeted promptly and were seated at a table by the window. Although we glanced briefly at the sandwich board that listed the daily specials, the lunch combos on the menu were a good deal ($14-$16) for sushi/sashimi/izakaya with rice, miso soup and salad. As more customers came in (this place fills up quickly), we noticed that they were all ordering the lunch combos(served from 11:30am to 2:00pm). Our server was pleasant, attentive, and very informative (I added ""izumitai (=white fish)"" to my vocabulary today). Hubby ordered the Lunch Combo #1 and I ordered the Sushi Lunch. Our miso soups were served piping hot. Mmmmm....comfort food for me! The salads were dressed in light vinaigrette and not doused with Thousand Island/Ranch dressing like most sushi restaurants. My sushi was very generously portioned and the freshest I've tasted. Both tuna and salmon melted in my mouth and was served at the perfect temperature. The sushi chef uses fresh ingredients, right down to the shiso leaf (they don't use plastic green leaves here) and the California roll (crab, avocado,fish stick) was carefully made. The pickled ginger was pleasant to eat (not overly strong or pungent) and the presentation was impeccable. We will be back to try some of the selections that are rarely offered elsewhere (e.g. sea bream, blue fin tuna, grilled whole squid, Japanese whiting).",positive
Best sushi restaurant in Calgary. They are also quite gluten free friendly. Many items can be made gluten free....just ask. Their sushi rice doesn't have any wheat ingredients in it! Love their seared salmon special. The service is excellent and they are quite patient with children. Can't get enough of this place!,positive
I heard this place is the sister restaurant to zi pang so no wonder I liked it so much. It's a little pricey for sushi but it's worth it. Authentic sushi in the north is hard to find. The only downside to this place is that it's too small and mostly reserved for dinner.,positive
"The best sushi in Calgary. My brothers and I eat here at least a couple time a week. Always for lunch, only once for dinner, but it doesn't matter it's always good. Staff is very friendly, the restaurant is always clean, the food shows the care and pride evident throughout this restaurant. Prices are very good as the he quality is better than any place I've dined for Japanese cuisine. My go to place.",positive
I love this sushi restaurant! The sushi is very fresh and high quality. The servers are friendly and polite. The restaurant is spacious and opens.,positive
"There was a quite a nice variety of items on the menu to start off with, which is always great when it comes to sushi. I'd like to share that I had called ahead & enquired about vegetarian options. I was delighted that the chef had created an elegant, regular-sized, roll for me in addition to the avocado & cucumber mini-rolls, for which I was super impressed! Although every plate brought out looked super delicious, I have to say that the most visually pleasing was the salmon & roe egg plate (see top image); The following were also ordered: miso soup; beef totaki; broccoli; veggie mix; both regular & fatty tuna, and salmon sashimi; soft shell crab roll; chicken combo; tofu salad; and a root veggie mix. There was so much delicious food. All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 4 out of 5. We will for sure be eating there again.",positive
"Such a calm environment, love the atmosphere here. Soft jazz music. I have found my new love. And his name is roku. It was so cute cause they brought around a white board with their specials of the day, and their chopstick covers had little fish on them (perfect to take home for bookmarks). It was an absolute delightful lunch. We both opted to get lunch combos. And of course the bf had to try out their salmon as well. The portion sizes were great. The plating was pretty to look at and eat as well. All the sashimi tasted very fresh. And the tuna was melt in your mouth yummy. The miso soup was not overly salty and you could tell a distinct difference in their soup base. It tasted richly of fish/dashi. Food came out at an amazing time. We barley had to wait for any of it. The aki fry was delicious! I think i could've eaten another ten pieces of it if my appetite permitted. Will visit here over and over again.",positive
"This place has some really quality Japanese food and a wonderfully wide menu selection, both in terms of cold dishes and hot dishes alike. You may find prices to be a wee bit on the higher side than some other places, but it's definitely worth what you're paying. The portions are great and the sushi always tastes fresh--consistency has not been an issue to me with this place. It's really a treat to have a sushi joint out here in the 'burbs that offers quality Japanese food. You won't be disappointed by the sushi here, and the service is A-OK to boot!",positive
My favorite sushi restaurant in calgary. The fish is always super fresh and excellent quality. They also have specials everyday. Their lunch combos are a great deal. Be sure to make reservations because they're very busy and usually packed.,positive
"My favourite sushi place in Calgary hands down. I was struggling to find a go to sushi place in Calgary ever since Wa's closed, and was so happy to find Roku. The sashimi here is amazing! Always super fresh and nice thick cuts. I like the udon here as well, and the special rolls are quite big. If you have room for dessert, I recommend the tempura banana with green tea ice cream. Soo good! The service is also always great here. If you are going on a weekend, I recommend making reservations in advance because the restaurant is pretty small. I like that they didn't try to cramp in as many seats as possible and there is lots of space in between tables. I find that dinner can get pretty pricey as all sushi can in Calgary. If you are on a budget, I recommend going for lunch. They have some lunch specials that I find are great and cheaper. The sashimi lunch is my fav! :)",positive
"Roku has quickly become one of my favourite places to go for lunch. One thing I love is that the lunch menu has a large variety of dishes. It keeps you wanting to come back until you've tried them all. The fish/sushi dishes are surprisingly fresh for the price, and the fried dishes are lightly crisped and not too oily. If the great food and atmosphere wasn't enough, the staff and servers there are some of the friendly and attentive in the city.",positive
"This time I came with my husband for dinner and had a mix of items off the menu and specials board. The specials, red tuna poke style, seared salmon belly sushi, and blue fin tuna sashimi were fresh and delicious, as was the kaki ponzu again. The rolls, however, were a bit disappointing... The 2 maki rolls, though fresh tasting, were in horrid shape! They looked like a person's first attempt at making sushi! Given the Japanese are known for exquisite presentation, I was surprised to see they served it looking like that! The large rolls had way too much rice in proportion to the stuff inside... Once again, no complaints about the quality of the fish and whatnot inside. Lesson learned: order hot foods, sushi and sashimi, but no rolls.",positive
"Fish aside, the rice is what makes good sushi. Sushi masters in training work on making rice for a year or something before they get to touch ANYTHING else (it might even be two... I don't really have the facts in front of me) so it's obviously important. I don't eat fish but I can tell you Roku has the best sushi rice of anywhere I've eaten in Calgary. The downside for me is they have a more limited menu for fishless sushi than some of the other sushi places but they have the old standards and they are pretty good. I also can't eat the miso which is also disappointing. Moving away from sushi they have some interesting other dishes like eggplant with tamarind sauce. Different, good but I'm not sure what I think of the texture. Even still, it's not something i've seen elsewhere and is something I can eat so there is props for that. Much of the staff speak japanese and are patient and indulge hubs as he's learning in preparation for an upcoming Japan trip. Luckily they speak english to me as I'm completely lost. :) Lunch combos are a pretty good deal if you're not a vegetarian... you can mix and match sushi and cooked food. Overall nice restaurant but the bill gets big quickly it seems.",positive
"Delicious dinner with a number of great choices for the non-sushi lovers. As a sushi lover, it was yummy and fresh! Highly recommended. The lunch menu has tweaked my interest and I will be back.",positive
"I could eat here every day! A lot of the clientele are Japanese, so when they say it's authentic, it's the real deal. They import their ingredients from Japan, and use a delicious combination of, I believe, rice vinegar and miso to make their rice. The result is oy-shi (delicious!). This is hands down the best sushi I have ever had. One tip is to not put too much wasabi on your rolls. The chef here puts wasabi in the rolls they should go in, giving you a truly authentic flavour profile. There is a good of cold and hot food. The service is also the best I've experienced. All the service staff attend to your every need, not just your one particular server, though this is of course mostly the case. One may think a five star rating should be reserved only for gourmet quality food, and it certainly deserves it. If you have a hearty appetite, you won't walk out of here without a dent in your wallet, but with food and service, you often get what you pay for. That being said, there are lunch and dinner specials around $25 each on the expensive side, and as low as $15. I would not hesitate to avidly recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience the best delicacies you can eat on this side of the Pacific.",positive
"Excellent, fresh sashimi! We had their blue fin tuna and salmon sashimi. We also ordered the fiddlehead with their unique mayo sauce, a daily special. The other dishes we tried were the kaki fry (fried oysters), plain soba noodles (big bowl), 2 dinner specials - fried chicken and the tempura - both dinners came with 2 appetizers (kind of a smoked salmon & sliced mushrooms), miso soup, a bowl of rice and a sushi plate - california roll (3 pcs), tuna sushi, yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi and prawn sushi. Lot s of food but every items was done with such finesse! A true Japanese gem in the Royal Oak area. Interesting piece of decoration in the middle of the restaurant - a large golden rock with vines. I asked the waitress what it was and she said it's an anthill! I'm not sure what the significance of the ant hill is. Great customer serivce!",positive
I went for lunch at roku with my friend. They have excellent and unique options for the lunch combos. I got sashimi and fried mackerel. It was delicious. The miso soup was perfectly flavoured - none of the super salty premade stuff that you find at other restaurants. The fried mackerel was light and flakey. Very high quality. Downside - no change table in the washroom for my baby! It's nice and open there. The presentation of the food was really beautiful. Price wise it is slightly higher than most lunch combos. I would like to try it again for dinner but I think I'll save it for a special occasion as it is slightly more expensive than my usual sushi joint. Side note - the owners daughter competed in Sochi 2014 for ski jumping!,positive
"On one of the walks I found in a book titled Calgary's best walks and stumbled on my first Rosso Coffee establishment. I know now that they have many locations. The americano was good and what I needed today. Quaint, nothing fancy and friendly people. Quiet no frills place with outdoor seating. They did not do a dark roast..... too bad.",positive
"I love Rosso, and have been a faithful customer since my first visit in 2010, every opportunity I can get. I am very excited that they have been opening up new locations, especially one in Inglewood that is now open late! The Ramsay location has always served me well. On my visit today during my lunch break, I discovered that they had discontinued their Tomato Jam Sandwich, which was a favourite of mine. While sad, the barista helped me choose an alternative, a yam sandwich. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. I love the industrial look & feel of this location, and the friendliness of the staff. I will never pass up a Rosso Latte. Ever.",positive
"This will be short and sweet. These dudettes make a mean ass cup of joe. The chicks there are cool as shit, they have next level swag and did I mention their coffee is amazing? Look, I'm cranky on the best of days and shitty establishments really grind my gears. This place put a smile on my face on a snowy dull day. I would drive out of my way to come here now that I've fond this gem. Cudos! They have such a cool location as well. You have to check them out. Let's see if they have the guts to post this on the wall.",positive
"Cafe Rosso is unassuming from the exterior. You'd never know a coffee house was here. Inside you will find a warm and inviting coffee joint perfect to meet friends, have a meeting or do some work at the coffice. Rosso roasts their own beans so occasionally you get to see the roaster in action. Lattes are always stellar. Their baked goods aren't quite as consistent but they seem to be making a few changes. Try the breakfast sandwich or the bagel bomb if you are peckish.",positive
"Great place to go for a coffee with your friends, nice environment & great coffee, one more thing also try the thai chicken soup because its awesome.",positive
"Overall they are excellent and I am a regular. They have great coffee, good food and a nice ambience. I wish they had large sized mugs like they used to. They switched to take out cups for their large and it is not as good. On occasion, the lattes or cappuccinos have not been hot enough and a few times the Thai soup has been too thick and old like it had sat too long. The service, food and ambience has been good overall. They have muffins and breakfasty things that are good. I will continue to frequent here. UPDATE: March 9th 2016. I have developed a dairy intolerance so i tried their soy milk latte and it was awesome!!!",positive
"Awesome coffee. Really recommend it. Also, it is located in an interesting location which is cool to check out if you enjoy discovering the city like I do.",positive
"Rosso now roasts their own coffee, and although it changes slightly from time to time as they use new beans, it is always consistently great!",positive
"A wonderful coffee shop where you wouldn't expect a wonderful coffee shop, but were hoping you'd stumble across a wonderful coffee shop. Voila! Caffe Rosso: a coffee shop that I'd go as far to say is... really really great! Ha! The sandwich signs, those foldable wood signs that don't resemble any sandwich I've ever eaten, are really important for finding this place. Well, that and a map on your phone. Use both FTW! If you're expecting to find a scrap metal yard or a heavy duty diesel repair shop, you're in the right place. Walking through the doors of Rosso is to step into an entirely different, coffee loving world. The warm smell of fresh roasted beans, a mix of rustic and modern design with brick walls, glass tables and those cool looking but uncomfortable backless chairs. To me, Rosso is the kind of place that is comfortable enough to enjoy your full cup of coffee, but you might not want to sit down with your laptop for too long. There's something about watching a roaster in action and Rosso's is out there in the open for you to see. It's interesting, calming, and you just can't take take your eyes off it - like a caffeine making Zamboni! The food I've had is delicious. I'd be happy to go out of my way to recommend their breakfast sandwich. It's a fun excuse to eat grainy mustard in the morning! Personal Review Milestone: #200!!!",positive
Had their hot coco. Very yummy. Great service. Great atmosphere. Love this place! Highly recommend it. Love the location as well.,positive
"Saturday I was at the Hawker's Market and got to try some of Caffe Rosso's coffee. Yum I was hooked. Sunday we were out and about in the glorious Calgary sunshine and decided to find these guys because we wanted coffee. Quite an interesting & unique neighbourhood. An eclectic mix of arts and almost too much industrial, but it works. The cafe has a ton of character both inside and out. Like a story being told over and over, but differently each time. Loved the mix of people inside. Old, young, hipster, grunge. Lots of peeps around for people watching but also quiet at the same time allowing us to sit down and have a conversation. Liked it. Staff uber friendly and helpful. A great little space.",positive
"Alright Rosso. Here comes my smack down. Interesting hood - reminds me of this old artist colony in Bejing. So, with that being said the building/architecture you can't really take credit for. The drinks are decent, with vegan options. Staff? Ok, I'm a hippy from Vancouver, let me preface my next anecdote with that....... The aloof hippies with dreads etc...that are too good for the customers, coffee and for general happiness, shouldn't work there. So when you're a goof, you could at least try to make my drink STELLAR so that I'll look past your failures and just give the place 4 stars for service, taste and locale/decor. You've failed the Rosso. Go to the box and feel shame.",negative
"Best coffee in the city. Best staff too. Only at Rosso is the drip coffee so delicious that sugar is totally not necessary. In addition to soy and lactaid milks, they are now stocking almond.",positive
"Success! Love discovering new places! This is way out of the way for me, but I'm always on the look-out for quaint coffee joints! Love the industrial feel, and the minimalism. Free wi-fi, and delicious americano are a must, and Cafe Rosso delivered!",positive
"After years and years of trying to visit this place. I finally landed @ Cafe Rosso. Its located in the strangest location (just off the blackfoot and past the train tracks) and if you don't like traffic circles you won't like going here. Rosso's does a great cup of Americano, at least in my opinion. Unlike other cafe's I've been too, I found that I didn't have to muck around with it too much. I should have jumped in and had the thing black, but alas I am not a coffee hardcore. They also have a small but great tea selection, which beats the packets cafe's carry and try to pass off as gourmet tea. How hard is it to keep a shelf of loose leaf tea? Come on respect the tea-drinking market here folks. Anyways I also had one of their muffins- a banana chocolate chip concoction- and it was deliciousness to the max! The staff were friendly once you get to chatting with them and the place wasn't too crowded for a Sunday afternoon. Rosso's sitting area was very comfy and I think encouraged strangers to take a chance in friendly small talk. Alas, the main reason for my review. An hour to closing time, one of the baristas and a frequent patron decided to brew coffee using the siphon coffee method. Some intense chemistry lab contraction was pulled out and in case you're wondering: http://youtu.be/wjH1hzl-Iq0 They got hilariously secretive bout the whole thing and insisted it wasn't offered on the menu because ""so many variables can go wrong"". As if I wanted another cup of coffee after two Americanos!? But guess what? I'm letting everyone know on the YELPERnet that you guys have this method on special request. Take that, secret society science coffee club!",positive
"""Oopsy - I made a poopsy!"" Pardon me? Really? Just imagine... you're sitting in the quaint and cozy Caffe Rosso in Ramsay, just south of Inglewood and you smell something funny... not ""funny, ha ha,"" but (sniff... sniff) ""this milk smells... funny."" That's when you realize your little one has used their diaper for the reason it was made for... oh, and you've forgotten your diaper bag (cause that happens - trust me, I did). Well, have no fear, Caffe Rosso is here to save your day, your lunch and a pending diaper rash! Not only does Caffe Rosso have a proper change table in the customer's spacious washroom, they also have diapers - three different bags of diapers... sizes 1, 2 & 3... and what's more - they're Huggies (not some generic no-name that are poor fitting and often results in some kind of unexpected rash). This is a pretty big deal - never in 3 & half years as a parent have I come across a coffee shop that had diapers in it. NEVER! Which means - IF you're that parent who brought your little ones on a coffee date and you've forgotten to restock the diaper bag with diapers or you've forgotten to bring the diaper bag altogether (and let's face it, it happens to everyone at least ...um ...ah ...at least once or twice) - the've got you covered! Okay, what about the rest of the Caffe? You know what, it's pretty cool too. A bit of an industrial feel to it. The first thing I noticed was a big, bright and spacious coffee shop. Room for everyone - staff & customers! Loads of space for customers - coffee tables, cocktail tables, lounge chairs and sofas. Patio seating with lots of south exposure... sun. Lots of sun. Free WIFI - however I didn't see any available power source and I looked pretty hard as my battery died after 40 minutes - I know, I need a new battery. The order counter is quite large - a lot of room for everyone (staff and customers a like) to order their favourite. Choices - coffee, tea, assorted juices, water, snacks, etc. The staff - very courteous. Actually, the best thing I noticed about the staff was their genuine willingness to serve you - you could tell they enjoyed what they were doing and they made me feel right at home. Washroom facilities... ya, we covered that. Nice big bathroom. A bit on the dark side. Black walls, vanity, toilet and flooring... and they have diapers! Did I mention they have diapers? Oh - and LOADS of free parking! How could Caffee Rosso move from 4 Stars to 5? - access to power. I'm not looking to hang out for half the day, I just don't have a very good battery and I don't like losing power. - the bathroom could be brighter... a bit dark in there. - the bathroom wasn't dirty but it could use a regular spot check and the small waste basket emptied... a few bits of rolled up paper towel on the floor. True, customers could actually put garbage in the... garbage... - my vanilla latte was average... I actually didn't taste any 'vanilla'. Weird. Bottom line, I'm a fan and I'll be back again...",positive
"My first trip to Caffe Rosso was last September. I've been back a few times since, and all I can say is this spot keeps getting better. If only there were an option to give it more than 5 stars. I popped in yesterday for an hour for a coffee and a muffin and to get some work done. The gals in line in front of me were trying to pay with debit, one of the staff got my order going while we waited. It seemed there was a problem with the machine. The debit was down. The girls didn't have any cash with them, neither did I. The nearest bank machine meant driving back into Inglewood. Oh dear. I've seen places shrug their shoulders at this and simply say ""sorry, the debit isn't working"" and leave it upto the customer to go find some cash and come back, or leave. The staff at Caffe Rosso on this day sent the two girls to go sit down and said they'd still bring them their lunch order and let them know if the debit came back online. They did the same for me with my coffee and muffin. An hour later, there was still no debit. The option? They printed out a receipt of what I ordered and asked me to come back again soon and settle up then. I offered to leave my name and number as well, I was told it wasn't necessary. You can bet I'm going back today to pay for that muffin and coffee... and that I'll be back again after this. Not many places take the ""we'll serve you anyway and trust you'll come back and cover your tab"" road. You rock Caffe Rosso.",positive
"Caffe Rosso is one of those places where you can grab a great coffee, enjoy some baking, have lunch and not feel bad about lingering. I have held many morning meetings here over a latte and scone and there is something remarkable that happens when we do 'business' in a relaxed atmosphere while breaking bread together.",positive
"We've been a fan of this place since literally before it even opened. Colin even made their website. I love getting a hot chocolate and a pannini from Rosso. The owner is a nice guy and the staff is always pleasant just like him. Try a fresh muffin or a scone. You can buy bags of their signature coffee beans as well. The panninis are made fresh when you order them and come nice and warm. I love chicken pesto one and the veggie one the most. The cafe is very clean and modern looking. They had these loose leaf teas sold in a tin last time I was there that they were selling for local vendor. I tried a few and I really didn't like them. I have a cupboard with a collection of about sixty or so loose leaf teas to compare too. If you want a good coffee and maybe a pastry then skip the conglomerates like Starbucks and Tim hortons and support this local gem. Believe me when I say I in no way have to say any of this and I would have no issue telling you if it sucked. If you don't know our neighborhood very well you may have a hard time finding it. It's on 24th ave off spiller road, Ramsay's pretty small so as long as you find spiller road you should be able to find it.",positive
This place is amazing... par none. There's no point writing an extensive review because everyone else says it all. But I highly recommend the Thai Chicken Soup!,positive
"Rosso is a neighbourhood gem. Though many people rave about their coffee - I am a tea drinker and like their selection of teas. Their sandwiches are good too. I'd love to see them expand their menu a bit in the future to include a few more items. Rosso staff are always friendly and polite. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, though good luck getting a seat at certain times of the day! A small challenge and one to be expected at a busy, popular spot.",positive
"Great food, nice service, cool & comfortable atmosphere - what more could you ask for! Took my 6 year old cousin here to work on his homework (I'm all about bribery when it comes to getting homework done). We split a panini - which staff happily customized so my half could have no cheese while his oozed with it - and it was a hit. This picky eater told me it tasted like a cheeseburger, and a pizza, but better. Brilliant! I also enjoyed a chai latte, and we split a chocolate muffin - yum! Stayed for about 2 hours to bust out some math learning. Only problem might be that there are only about 10 tables. Not a super big issue when we were there on a Saturday afternoon, but I could see it filling up for sure.",positive
"Just enjoying my second cup of coffee here today. Very cool, trendy but casual coffee and lunch destination with a community feeling. Food is good- veggie options are very tasty. Bought a bag a coffee beans that is roasted for Cafe Rosso by Phil and Sebastian. It's direct trade coffee-no middlemen, so the farmers get a very fair price, which hopefully protects their livelihood and the environment too. There is plenty of parking, and it's free. Great little place.",positive
"Wow this place really is as good as the review's say! I went here over the weekend with my girlfriend and I must say I am amazed. The coffee is hands down the best in Calgary, the staff are friendly, and the food was excellent too. For lunch I had a non-fat latte ""kid's temp"" - which came to me with a smiling face (will post picture later), a California turkey club panini (turkey, guacamole, tomato, cheese, mustard) and Thai chicken soup. It was delicious. The soup was perfectly spiced and really fresh, defiantly homemade. I am going to make this place my new hang out and spend a lot of time there! The atmosphere is very appealing too and I have made a list for you: 1) They use halogen track lighting, so the colors are enhanced and it feels warm and cozy. Ceiling is not too high but not too short. There are beams that are very relaxing to stare at. 2) The shape of the room is a square rectangle. This makes it warm and cozy and you feel as if you were home in your living room. Let me give you a quick example of what does not work: Phil & Sabastian's on 17th is one large long rectangle. The order counter is huge and tables line the long room. It makes it feel cold and people are always walking past you; ick. The square rectangle works. 3) The restaurant temperature is 74F (22C) not the typical cold Calgary 70F/20C. You feel warm and can stay all day and relax without freezing. No drafts either, door faces a non-windy direction. 4) Cool sights out the windows - next to a old factory type retrofitted building; views of a 10,000 volt sign with a cloths line next to it, cool old door thing, cool old building lights, and other views. Also there is some great artwork on the walls. Impressionistic stuff... I love it! 5) Chairs are soft, yet still firm and the tables are round glass ones - very cool looking and just the right size. There are also very comfy leather couches, plenty of plug-ins for laptops, and a good amount of tables but not too many that it feels too big. 6) Did I mention free Wi-Fi? 7) There is Splenda (What is with all these places in hating Splenda and only serving stevia. Let consumers have their choice!) 8) Good selections of free newspapers. 9) Decent scones and baked goods with a changing selection. 10) Good plates with funky shapes but not too weird; the soup and sandwich was served on a round cornered rectangle plate. It was just the right size and unique but not to the point where it draws too much attention or sacrifices functionality. It sounds stupid but this is very important. The cups for lattes are also very nice. Easy to hold, and come with these little spoons. Seriously sweet! 11) Independently owned and supports other local businesses 12) Nice bathrooms - clean and contemporary with change tables and stuff for mom's/dad's The list goes on and on; I love this place for every little detail. It is just plain perfect in every way and I plan to spend a lot of time and money there over the next few years.",positive
"My first experience of good coffee in Calgary. After years of Starbucks, I didn't know what a latte was supposed to taste like. I can thank Caffe Rosso for getting me interested in espresso (my wife thanks you, too, for the hundreds of dollars of equipment I bought to feed my new habit). I once drove 40 minutes into the city -- during rush hour -- JUST to go to Caffe Rosso and get a latte. I didn't regret it one bit! Great atmosphere, awesome baristas, and of course, amazing coffee. The only thing I'm disappointed with are the short business hours (only open until 5), but it's probably justified based on where they are in the city. Also, if you're a fan of flavored lattes, they do not have syrups for their drinks here.",positive
"A friend of mine wanted to get together before I head out of town this weekend and he suggested we meet up at Cafe Rosso. Having never been before, I didn't let the opportunity pass me by. Boy am I glad! Cafe Rosso is *AMAZING*. I don't even know where to start. I love the atmosphere, the staff is incredible and they serve a MEAN espresso/coffee. Plus it's almost sacrilegious to call this place a coffee house considering they go above and beyond! I'm talkin' muffins, scones and homemade bread served FRESH out of the oven, as well as soups, fresh paninis, wraps, yogurt cups, homemade granola bars, and the list goes on and on. Plus they offer unlimited and free WIFI for all their customers. Seriously - this place has got it all. If you're already a regular, I am joining your team. if you've never been, then isn't it time you experienced one of the 5 star business in our city?!?!? GET ON IT!",positive
"Today I sat down, at home, and savoured a Bodum load of Terroir Brazilian Daterra roasted ""Southern Italians Espresso"" made strong enough to use for axle grease. I you are a black coffee drinker, such as me, you will immediately notice after a little cooling that this coffee has a natural sweetness that lingers on your mid palette for almost an hour after drinking. It has fantastic body and flavour reminiscent of a rhum baba with dark chocolate syrup. In 2007 Coffee Review gave this particular product from GH 93 points out of 100. There is not much to say. I buy strictly beans and they carry the Terroir brand of George Howell from Acton, MA. Terroir is, simply put, among the finest coffee roasters on earth; the local Phil and Sebastian and Fratello Coffee Roasters are their equals. George Howell is the founder of the Cup of Excellence program where tens of thousands of different coffees are tasted from participating countries and and only about 2 or 3 percent make the list of excellence. If is quality you seek, this is a must stop vendor of coffee beans.",positive
Caffe Rosso is a neighbourhood gem for Ramsay and worth making the drive for their outstanding coffee and fresh baked breads. They opened up a second location at the TELUS Convention Centre downtown that should be just as popular. Decor at the Ramsay District is pretty cool too with Italian furnishings and contemporary art.,positive
"Cafe Rosso is quite a gem. Great espresso and freshly baked tasty treats. Ramsey is lucky to have this spot - warm, comfortable interior, friendly employees. I can normally find something sarcastic to say about everything but Cafe Rosso is just all around good. Sans sarcasm. Check it out...but don't check it out too much, because I like feeling cooler than everyone else who hasn't heard of it yet.",positive
"First time here, found out the hard way they don't except plastic! There was a ATM inside not a fan about paying $2.50 to get money for a $5 order but it is what it is. Nowhere to sit and eat here so i has to eat out in the car. The crust was good, but and yes there's a but hardly any cheese on it . They add the pepperoni on at the end so it's not cooked and the sauce pretty much tasted like a tomato. Not my style of pizza . But hey I tried it !!!",negative
"I crave this pizza all the time. My husband and I only eat heavy carbs once a week so I don't get to eat it as much as I'd like, but this pizza is seriously so good. Since I'm not from Pittsburgh, I was really confused about the cold cheese at first, but it somehow works. And I love how the dough is so fluffy and airy yet still crunchy. It's just perfect. I want some now. This review is making me hungry. I'm glad my husband knows how to order because thinking about having to call and order makes me nervous, haha! Oh and you need cash. That also makes me nervous, because I hardly ever carry cash. But despite the qualities of this place that induce anxiety within me, it's worth it!",positive
"Pizza by the slice! Sam's is my husband's favorite pizza joint in Canonsburg. He's a very frequent customer, and Sam and his family always treat him so nicely!",positive
Out of all the pizza in the Pittsburgh area this place is my personal favorite. The pizza is thick with ample amounts of some killer sauce. The topping options are vast and the prices are amazing. 20$ for a tray of pizza is unstoppable in my opinion it's 4 boxes of pizza. Only heads up is they don't take credit cards but they have an ATM right in store so it's really not a problem at all!! If your in the area I recommend stopping by and trying some of the best pizza around!!,positive
"Honestly, if I wanted a pizza that looks and tastes like I made it myself I would not pay $32 for it. Maybe some like thick, mushy crusts and uncooked pepperoni, though. Also, you can't pay with a credit card. But don't worry; they have an ATM in the shop with a $5 fee per transaction. Score! (My first and only order was around July 2015. )",negative
"The food is great, but that's not what makes Sam's so special. It's the people, the owners are so friendly and personable. You feel like your visiting very special friends when you walk in... Excellent food and charming service",positive
I absolutely love the pizza here! It's by the slice so you can get a different topping on each piece if you want! Quality ingredients and always fresh plus it's very reasonably priced !! Their newest topping is bacon and it's a must try!!,positive
"Best Pizza Ever!! The crust is absolutely amazing! Every time I come to Canonsburg, I have to stop by and pick up some Sam's Pizza!",positive
The Italian hoagies from Sam's Pizza Shop are great. I think that the only place that has better Italian hoagies anywhere near here is Fiori's Pizza in Pittsburgh!,positive
"A super weird place... I called to make a reservation for the next day for a group of 6 at 6:30-7. A woman that picked up the phone said that there was no reason to reserve and to call back the next day around 4 to pre-order appetizers so they would be ready when we come in. I confirmed that they will be open, will be able to accommodate 6 people for dinner and that calling tomorrow will be fine. I got affirmative answers to all three questions. I call back the next day at 4, the same woman answers, and... I'm told that they have a private party and the restaurant is fully booked. To my astonished reminder of our prior conversation I was told: we close at 5, you can't come at 6:30. Totally confused I ask again if they are closed or have a private party. To this I was told that it should not matter to me since I can't come any way and, after saying a curt bye, the woman hung up. One might try to write this off to a language barrier, but I won't since I spoke to her in Russian...",negative
"I went with a group. It's surprising how few Russian choices are on the menu for a restaurant that labels itself as Russian. Menu definitely leans towards Middle-eastern fare. Two of us ordered the beef stroganoff, while two ordered kabobs. The diners with kabobs said they were fine, but the two of us who ordered stroganoff received a bowl of frozen vegetables with watery broth and hard little pellets of some kind of meat that still had the fat on it. It was nothing like stroganoff and the waitress took away full bowls without comment. The lepeshka bread was very good, except for the underside of about a third of it being burned black. How do you serve burned bread to a paying customer? But I guess they're passing off frozen vegetable soup as beef stroganoff, so that's where the standards are here. On the plus side, the dining area was spotless.",negative
Staying in downtown Phoenix for work conference. Drove out here (25-30 minute drive from downtown) only to find the place locked at 6:30 pm on a Wed. night. Hours clearly state open Sun-Thurs 10 am-9 pm. No answer when I called. Not cool.,negative
I want to actually rate this restaurant. I have tried to come here two times now but they do a great business in private parties and shut down for regular business. This may be my last week in Phoenix so I might not get a chance to sample what sounds like a phenomenal Kosher Uzbeki dining experience. I look forward to being able to change my review to one where I've actually eaten there. My advice CALL AHEAD CALL AHEAD CALL AHEAD,negative
"The sign outside proclaims that the place is Russian. But if you consider that the city of Samarkand is one of the largest cities of Uzbekistan, you won't be surprised to note that the restaurant has strong Middle Eastern influences, and these influences are reflected in the murals and the menu. My friend and I came in mid-afternoon so we were pretty much the only people there. We ordered eggplant salad, cabbage salad, and kababs; all were quite tasty and filling, especially with the samples of the dense Uzbek lepeshka bread the friendly hostess gave us. A really nice Russian lager complemented the fine meal. I'll definitely be back; I need to try the more mainstream-Russian dishes next time.",positive
"I've stopped in twice during normal hours and was told they were currently not serving?!?! If third try is a charm, we may never know.",negative
"I do like exploring different Kosher restaurants around the country and they're usually okay. I went with a party of ten, so I expected the service to be a bit slower, which is fine. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. She let us taste all of the appetizers. I have to point out, the hummus was very good. The food was good, I had the lamb chops. The french fries were excellent. The entire menu was very reasonably priced. Overall, I'd give it four stars.",positive
"This was possible the most laughably obscure dining experiences of my life. I wanted to like this place so much. If there was one food I could eat for the rest of my life, I would probaly choose borscht, and maybe lamb kebabs. This place has both, and desperate to flex my Russian language and culture muscles in Phoenix, I went into this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon to grab a menu to find the place completely empty. We left to go shopping and returned over two hours later to find this place still empty, but we sat down after the great reviews, and my over-powering love for Russian and Middle Eastern food. No one greeted us, and we stood in the doorway calling, ""Hello?"" at an increasing volume. After several minutes I wandered into the kitchen and asked if they are open, to the disgruntled and seemingly annoyed owners that said yes. The lady that I assume was the owner was very nice, she helped us navigate around the bread menu and recommended the Kompot, which was a little sweeter than I have experienced before, but was still decent. Her husband in the kitchen was yelling at her the entire time not fifteen feet from our table, and I never complain about ambience, but even this bothered me. The borscht came, which was large chunks of beets cut into thirds, and carots nearly whole boiled in water. I know I am used to the creamy Saint Petersburg borscht and this is more of an Uzbek restaurant, but it was so flavorless and disappointing I had to add table salt to the clear pink broth (and I really hate salt). The lamb was all gristle and fat, and the chicken was very dry. I asked the owner/our server if she had any sour cream for the borscht. She looked at me with a blank stare without saying anything, so I asked the same question in Russian, to which she stared at me as if I was a moron that asked her for a golden pony. She said no, and disappeared into the kitchen without a word. Halfway through the meal a young woman came into the restaurant and started speaking frantically to me, in a language that was neither English or Russian. She grabs my arm and starts to corral me towards the kitchen (as I am still mid bite, chewing) and places what I think was a business card in my hand and yells at me pointing, to what I assume was a command to give it to the owner. After I swallow and get past my initial moment of absolute puzzlement of why I have to do this, I notify the owner that someone is looking for her, and walk back to my table, very confused. The owner screams at the girl until she runs out the door, and without pause or apology, refills our water glasses with a smile. I will break from my story to address the decor in which everyone seems to be upset about. It was probably on of my favorite aspects of the dining experience. Blue ocean wallpapers and mirrors gave this small restaurant a unique and more open feel, and it felt distinctly like Uzbekistan. It was certaintly not a 5 star dining experience, so who expects the decor to match? So after we paid and left, we mumbled with a confused laugh that the dining experience was...well, an experience, but I will probably not return. I reviewed this a few months late, so perhaps they have gotten their act together, or maybe just came on a very peculiar day? Nevertheless, I will probably not return and just make my own Russian food at home.",negative
"This is my first experience with Kosher Uzbekistan food and it was not disappointing at all. The owner was very nice and helped us order and I was pleased with it all. There were 3 of us so we ordered a few different things to try out. We got a pitcher of Kompot which is a refreshing fruit drink, its pretty much a hodgepodge of fruit (cherries, berries, prunes, apricots...) and it has a very light taste, not sweet like most juices, I'm looking into making some myself, we all liked it. We also got a fresh salad( just tomatoes and cucumber which seems like a bland boring salad but it wasn't) it had some really nice flavors, Lepeshka Bread (hot dense bread) and Samsa (meat filled pie) which were very good as well. And then there were the kabobs... oh my were they tasty. We ordered a lamb, chicken, and beef kabob and they were all delicious. They food is very filling but much worth it and am looking forward to eating there again.",positive
"I'm going to echo some of the other reviews on here. This restaurant is close by my office so I tried it for lunch, recently. Upon entering, the place looked deserted. The dining room is attractive, but seemed to be set up for a birthday party. It looks like it was remodeled recently. After making a bit of noise for about 3-4 minutes, a lady came out and seated us. The woman was very friendly and did a good job making recommendations. The food took a while to arrive. The soups we had were great and so was the salad. We had some shish kabbabs (lamb, beef and sea-bass). The beef and sea bass was good, but the lamb had bits of bone and was fairly gristly. The rice was good for the first few bites and then I got a mouthful of slimey wierdness once I got through the top layer. If you ask for water, you get a bottle of Aquafina, which is fine, but unexpected. While we were eating, another party showed up (that makes 2 groups total). Even though the place was almost empty, it took almost 10 minutes to get our check and another 5 to pay. This wait would have been expected in most parts of Eastern and Western Europe, unfortunately it can be a deal-breaker someone who has a limited time for lunch. I hate to sound overly negative about Samarkand, because the people working there are actually quite nice and some of the food was good. I will keep it in my lunch rotation and see what happens in future visits.",negative
"For years I heard about borscht and pirozhki amongst other Russian and East European favorites. I always wondered what the hype was about borscht. The problem is that there aren't many Russian eateries in Phoenix (just this place and another up north, that I know of) so I never had the chance to try out this cuisine. Then a Russian friend told me about a Russian-Uzbeki place he heard about called Samarkand Restaurant and naturally I went, and he came along with me. We've actually been there twice already. Like Mr. K's review said, it's in a strip mall which sits directly across the street from another strip mall in which the Russian Market resides (I have reviewed the Russian Market too). We walked in and immediately got a whiff of some sort of soup (it was pelmeni soup, more on that later) and got an eye full of the nice decor (they did some decorating since Gina W's earlier review); mirrored walls with pictures of domed mosques, a chandelier, gold inlay adorned tile floors, fancy dishware set out on each table, and of course, traditional Uzbeki-Russian music playing overhead. Behind the counter there's a framed picture of Mike Tyson himself posing with with Svetlana and her husband at the restaurant. Apparantly Mike has a taste for more than just mutulated ears and he has stopped by a few times for a bite (no cheesy pun intended). We stepped forward and Svetlana greeted us, told us to take a seat, and handed us menus. The food is actually pretty good. This is what we ordered on our first and second visits: ------------------------------ First visit: We weren't fully familiar with the menu, so Svetlana sat down and walked us through the menu. I got: **Borscht - The infamous borscht that I had heard so much about. It was pretty good; tasted similar to what I thought it would taste like. **Pirozhki - Small meat filled pies approximately the size of a dinner roll. You'll find these under the appetizer section as ""Samsa"", the Uzbek alternate name, but they'll know what you mean by pirozhki. My friend and myself loved these. We ate a couple of them. l recommend you get a couple of these, you won't regret it. Our second visit was mainly inspired by the pirozhki and lipioshka alone. **Lipioshka - A danish-like round bread served hot and fresh. We shared it, and much like Mr. K, we also really liked it and it's very filling. This bread comes with a tasty sauce that you dip the lipioshka into. It's much like salsa but with a greener/leafier taste. I recommend also getting the lipioshka along with the pirozhki. **My friend also got pelmeni soup and two marinated beef kebabs with a complimentary side of rice. ----------------------------- Second visit: Like the first time, we asked for pirozhki and a lipioshka again. This time I decided to try the pelmeni soup and I came to find out that the whiff that you first get as you walk in is that of this soup. I really don't know why it smells like pelmeni, seeing as to how it's obviously not the only thing that's prepared there. Anyhow, the soup itself is simple but good. It's basically ravioli squares stuffed with beef in a broth with a sort of grass. Very filling. Again, my friend ordered some kebabs with rice and onions. ----------------------------- Just like another reviewer said, you will be full for hours. We will be going back to Samarkand later on. (If you are wondering about price, my friend and myself spent $15-$17 each, both times there.) I recommend it because the food is good and filling and besides, how many other Russian-Uzbeki joints have you seen around town? None right? Then here you have the opportunity to experience a culinary rarity. And If a tough nail like Mike Tyson likes it, then you know it must be good. And besides, you wouldn't want to disagree with Mike's choice; we know what happens when someone has a disagreement with him. Just watch the news. It's not pretty.",positive
"This is my first review on Yelp and Samarkand is the restaurant that inspired me to register and write my first review. Unfortunately, this is not a good thing. This restaurant was utterly disappointing and has set a new low point in my culinary experience. I went in for lunch on a Monday with a friend. We walked in to the restaurant to find it empty and decorated with ""Happy 1st Birthday"" banners. We thought that they were closed for a private party and my friend suggested we should go somewhere else.. I should have listened. After spending a minute or two shouting ""hello"", we were greeted with a nice lady who assured us they were open and sat us down on one of the many empty tables. The place was clean, but had a ""funky"" smell to it. Since we had never had Russian food we decided to be adventurous. We ordered some home made fruit drink that did not agree with our palates, and sumsa (which is bread, filled with ground beef and onions) to start with. We also ordered some bread (can't remember the name) to eat with our marinated lamb and marinated beef sheesh kabobs. Fruit drink: Did not finish. Not for us, not sweet, had an odd aftertaste. Sumsa: Did not finish: Tasted and smelled like the meat filling had gone rancid before cooking. Bread: Majority consumed. Tasteless, but edible. Marinated Beef: Did not finish. Tough, chewy and tasteless. Marinated Lamb: Did not finish. Chunks of fat on bone. No meat to be seen. Absolutely disgusting. Needless to say, I will not be returning, or recommending this place to anyone. I wish I could rate this place to zero stars, but Yelp does not allow for it. NOTE: No one else came in to eat at the restaurant the entire time we were in it (peak lunch hour time).",negative
"Very nice surroundings, high quality food and over all great experience. Not sure what the people who reviewed this place expected. It's a great lobby cafe to a nice hotel. Keep up the good work.",positive
"The restaurant is small. I was seated quickly however drink and food orders took a little time. There was only one hostess and she was also responsible for taking food orders and delivery to the tables. The buffet was basically eggs (made to order), potatoes, and turkey sausage, pork sausage and bacon. I felt the sausage and bacon were under cooked and asked the cook to make them crispy but that took more time. They offered small boxes of cereal. They had yogurt sitting out in a bowl and fruit and nut toppings. I saw a few pastries available. Service was slow because there was only one cook. The pancakes looked delicious but are not included with the buffet . They offer mimosas but they are $14 each. On the bright side, I didn't have to wait for an hour like the people in line for a different restaurant across the street.",negative
"Went for breakfast before a Jays game. Got an omelette, good array of toppings, but they don't give you much cheese. A good pastry, fruit and cheese selection. The yogurt, berries and granola station was everyone's favourite. Something about that granola! Can't get eggs benedict until brunch, so we were too early. :( The service was fantastic. She was cheerful and on top of things. A bit expensive, but that's to be expected at a hotel. A clean, bright spot.",positive
"Two orders of breakfast. One arrives 15m before the other. By the time the second order arrives, the first one is cold. Cold sunny side up. Cold breakfast. Bleh. The server handled our toasts with bare hands after touching all kinds of stuff. Yikes. I can see why they only receive two stars here.",negative
"Want to sit all day and drink a coffee with your laptop? This is a good place to do it. Want to eat a normal, timely breakfast? SKIP AVOID BEWARE. Came down before my work pickup and budgeted myself 30-45 minutes for breakfast. This is what we ordered: * A coffee * Oatmeal * A bowl of fruit * A bagel These four items were not even delivered to our table in 45 minutes! My pickup had arrived and I had to ask them to package it to go. It took them another 10-15 minutes to package it up, and when they did they didn't provide any silverware to eat with. Asked for it and within 5 minutes I knew I had to leave. There was 1-2 other tables eating in the restaurant. I know they have to do the whole hotel but come on, coffee, oatmeal, a bowl of fruit, and a bagel is not a crazy order. The bagel didn't even start toasting until I asked for it to-go. Oh, and by the way, the expensive oatmeal is INSTANT OATMEAL! I saw the guy making it from a Quaker Oats bag. Uhhhh no.",negative
"We only got coffee from here but it was the new low bar for how bad coffee can taste. I had a latte, my husband had a mocha. Both were like bitter piss, we had one sip and then tossed the to-go cups in the trash. They had some pastries out and I considered getting one but they looked pretty generic and blah. After the bad coffee experience, I was happy I didn't waste the money. AWESOME hotel but they need to improve this restaurant.",negative
"Grabbed a quick cup of Earl Grey to go from here. I wasn't sure if they served the public as I approached from the street but was pleased to be spoken to by a busy chef letting me know someone would help me in a minute. Overall this is a hotel restaurant that also serves walk-ins and offers take away. Tea was standard and in extra big cups I would go back for a cup if in a pinch. The layout was a bit stuffed and uninviting for those coming in from the street which left me feeling rushed with not enough space do to the layout and lack of space to sort out paying my bill and gathering my purchase, had it been a bit more welcoming from this perspective I may have ordered more than just the tea.",negative
"Came here for lunch and we were gravely disappointed w/ the food. The lunch menu was nothing special and overpriced. I ordered a chicken club sandwich because nothing else on the menu sounded appetizing and I honestly thought I couldn't go wrong with such a classic lunch staple. Wrong. The chicken was overcooked and the tomato jam tasted disgusting. I mean, it was edible I guess but for $20, it was so underwhelming and overpriced. My friend ordered a salad with smoked shrimp and didn't end up eating the shrimp because it was too smokey. Service was mediocre- waitress never came by to refill our glasses. Not coming back.",negative
"I was here for dessert. They have variety of moose cakes and cheese cakes dessert. The size of the cakes are single person size, and they are exceptional. The white chocolate cheese cake is a balance between cheese and milk flavor. Chocolate hazelnut cake is rich in chocolate with hazelnut all around, which is really good although I prefer the hazelnut more on crispy/crunchy side. The desserts are $7.50 each for the two that I ordered. I expect they did some work on dessert decoration but they didn't do an impressive job... coffees are so so but at $4 each, and if you want some liquor in your coffee after your dinner, then it cost you $10. The atmosphere here give you an impression that it is a nice restaurant, but it is not exceptional. Overall, it is not an impressive restaurant that I go unless I have extra money to spare.",negative
"I've said it before, I'll say it again...I know that Winterlicious (or Summerlicious, for that matter) is not the best time to judge a restaurant on its food. So...I will try not to. But the service. Service is key during Winterlicious! (Or Summerlicious!) I went here for lunch on Wednesday. There was no clear place to wait for the host/hostess so I waited for someone to notice me. I was noticed, and then I waited until they finished doing whatever they were doing. Then my reservation was taken, but not my coat. Seriously? I know you have a coat check, so why does everyone have their coats on the backs of their chairs like we're in Swiss Chalet? The table was set for all three guests, but only two menus were provided. Huh? I had to ask for a third. I had the seafood croquette, the salmon and then the cheesecake. The croquette was pretty flavourless, but the roasted red pepper sauce that it was served with was pretty good. The salmon was definitely the highlight. It was well cooked and sat on a bed of yummy firm lentils and braised bok choy. Unfortunately, this was followed by the ""duo of white and dark chocolate cheesecakes."" I have a MASSIVE sweet tooth. I will eat almost anything sugar based. However, I learned something about myself this week. I will not eat weird ball-shaped, STILL FROZEN cheesecake. The shape didn't offend me, though it didn't please me. I honestly still cannot believe the cheesecake was still frozen. Neither I nor my friend who also ordered the cheesecake ate it. Also, we only realized at the end that we were not served any bread. WTF? Isn't this place supposed to also be a bakery? Anyways, this experience did not entice me in any way to go back and try their full-priced menu...not with plenty of other places serving delicious food AND offering good service.",negative
"The service has gone downhill. I brought two of my friends here for lunch as they haven't been before, I told them it was terrific. I had been here a couple times for dinner and lunch in the past, and the last time I visited Senses was only to buy their pastries for a meeting. When I arrived this time, holding a baby in a carrier, the hostess looked right at me, and then went behind me to some other people that seemed to have just arrived and asked if she could help them. Then she took their coats and hung them up. I suppose these other people could've been waiting first but she could have politely acknowledged me. After seating them she came back to me and without saying ""hello"" asked if I had reservations, which I did, and then replied ""well she is already there"" with a tone like I should've known this, and then she didn't even ask to take my coat. When I arrived at my table my friend also complained about the service as well, and I heard other grumblings at nearby tables. My friends ordered the cheesecake which they didnt know would be frozen balls, they were disappointed. When I ordered a coffee they didn't ask me if i wanted cream, just brought milk. They also forgot to bring us bread. I know these are all small things but its these small gestures that make a great experience at these fine dining restaurants. If I wanted this type of service level I would go to a diner. However, my entree, the steak, was delicious and cooked perfectly. Having said that, I won't be bringing any more friends here - I was a little embarassed.",negative
"Ive wanted to try the restaurant for a long time and finally did during Winterlicious 2012. I have to say that the dinner was not worth $45. I'm not sure if it was because it was the first night of Winterlicious or whether its always like this but the service and the food was very poor. The guys bringing out the food almost always went to the wrong table/individual. The food was rather disappointing. The bread was not hot and didn't seem fresh. The appetizer of squash ravioli was good and tasted homemade but I made the mistake of getting the halibut main entree. Its hard to cook halibut unless you are skilled in the kitchen and the fish was very dry. The lentils and vegetable sides were good though. The dessert was terrible - I don't think anyone's was good whether it was the apple pie, cheesecake or whatever - would have expected more since they have a bakery. I guess I gave this resto a bad rating because I expected so much more and was left disappointed.",negative
"I rushed to Sen5es Restaurant for a nice dinner because my Groupon was about to expire. I couldn't make a reservation because it was already booked full, but luckily, we managed to snag a spot early in the evening. Now onto the food: The complimentary bread was really nice. But sadly it was served with goat milk butter. Since both my mom and I hate goat milk, we left the butter untouched. French onion soup with sweet onion tart- I found the deconstructed presentation interesting. Instead of placing the pastry on top of the soup, it was served on the side as a sweet onion tart. The soup was delicious and not overly cheesy, as French onion soups often can be. Prime beef tenderloin and foie gras: truffled mash, green asparagus, and truffle veal jus. Altogether, this was a very rich dish. The beef tenderloin was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. I particularly enjoyed the aromatic truffled mash, which was ridiculously creamy and rich. The only disappointment was the asparagus, as they were amazingly salty to the point of being inedible. The beef, foie gras and mashed potatoes were all exceedingly rich (albeit delicious) and finishing the entire plate would have put me in a coma. Quartet of crème brûlée: vanilla, chocolate, ginger and mocha. Every one of them was divine! The texture was velvety smooth and creamy with a perfectly caramelized top. I thought that the coffee flavour in the mocha was a tad overpowering, whereas the chocolate and ginger were subtle complements to the natural flavour of the crème brûlée. All in all, it was a lovely meal, although I'm not sure that I'll be returning without a Groupon due to the steep prices. The quartet of crème brûlée definitely made a strong impression on me, and I'll most likely come back for the desserts.",positive
"Okay. My friend picked out this place, and considering she is a vegetarian, and she doesn't eat meat, it's surprising that she would pick a place that has no alternatives to meat. My main problem is that there was a short hair, or an eyelash on my Scallops app. It was on the plate, not in the actual food, but not appetizing. I didn't like the broth it came in, not very tasty. The scallops were great! But, when I found the eyelash or hair, I asked our waiter (who was beyond nice), to take it away, and he said he would take care of it. Unfortunately, having run into another restaurant (Milestones) that had a piece of plastic in my food, they said they would take care of it, as in my bill. But I was BILLED for my app. I told them I wasn't paying for it, and they took it off. For my main course, I ordered the lamb. I asked for well-done, I got PINK lamb. I asked them for a refire, and they did, but when they brought it back, it was still red (more red in other areas). For dessert, I got creme brulee (vanilla, chocolate, mocha x 2, I didn't want the ginger). AMAZING. I gave the waiter a 11% tip, he helped me with my coat afterwards and was just so nice, I couldn't be mean to him. He's not the one that cooked my food. He's just the poor messenger.",negative
"Had drinks and dinner in the bar last night. It is what you would expect from a nice hotel bar - good service, lots of fancy drinks, and a limited but reasonable selection of food. The atmosphere is elegant, quiet and quite dark. We joked that it would be the perfect place to bring your mistress. I had the lamb kabobs served with couscous, and my friend had a kobe burger and fries. My meal was delicious, although it surprised me that the couscous was cold (while the lamb was of course hot). The creamy sauce on the side (tzatziki I think) was a little over-powering, but I guess that's why it's on the side. My friend's meal was huge - a big juicy burger and lots of crispy french fries. $80 for one drink and meal each. Nice for a treat out but if I were looking for this sort of atmosphere I would probably check out the Roof Lounge at the Hyatt first.",negative
"I went their with 5 other friends on the first day of winterlicious. I made the rsvp at 8:30pm. Although there were some of us who were a bit late, we didn't get to be seated until approx. 9:15pm!the wait was extremely long, especially considering that we've made a reservation. Not only was the wait for a table was long..the wait for the food between each course was annoying too. We officially got up and put on our jackets around 12 am! Now onto the food. It really annoyed me and my friends how one's dish can be so different in size when almost all of us ordered the same thing. 5/6 of us ordered the lobster tail as appetizer but mine was so tiny compared to my friend's. I understand that lobster don't all come in the same size...but the huge size difference really disappointed me. Then onto the main course, all of us got the lamb, which I really regret. Again, some of use got more meat than the others. Two of us were done when the others have only ate half of their dish. The sizes of the desserts were pretty filling and finally more proportionate. In terms of the tastes of the food, the appetizer, lobster tail tasted nothing special. It did taste really fresh and great with the sauce it came with, but nothing surprising at all. As for the lamb, very disappointing. Our server told us that it can only be cooked to rare so there will be pink and blood, but that was hardly the case when we got it. If you blind-folded me I wouldn't even be able to tell it was lamb...it tasted like an ordinary piece of meat. The dessert I got was the pana cotta which was pretty good. It was my first time trying this dessert though, so don't got any previous experiences to compare to. Oh, forgot to mention, my friend and I also ordered a cocktail. One called seduction and another called sinful. Both tasted really good but we didn't get them til our main course came! As for the service, not bad...but not exceptional either. Overall, $45 for winterlicious...I totally don't think it' worth it! don't think I'll go again. If I ever do...probably just for the dessert or bar.",negative
"Terrible service, worst we've experienced at a Toronto dining establishment. - 45 minutes for appetizers, when finally arrived it was delivered to wrong table and servers didn't realize. So it took a total of 70 minutes from time of order to receive our appetizers. - At the 1 hour mark into the meal our main courses were delivered (this point we were still waiting for the appetizers that have yet to arrive). - Server brought main course back into kitchen and kitchen simply reheated it when proper time to serve us our mains. - Dessert was accompanied by the bill which we did not want and there was no waiting list to dine at restaurant. - $107 total bill, left $110. Never coming back again. Terrible service and the food not great either. Refuse to ever go back again. Very unfortunate as the ambiance was nice. Save your money.",negative
"Well -- this is actually for the Bar side of the Senses restaurant. First off -- it is not an inexpensive place but both the food and wine were great. Good ambiance -- not too loud music -- wonderful for catching up with friends and actually being able to talk! Modern decor and comfortable. We had the burgers and frites and I have to say, while the burger was on the expensive side, it was definitely one of the best I have ever had in the city! It had portbello mushroom cap, bacon and cheese on it with the othr fixings. Yummy! So, if you are looking for a nice place to have a bite with friends, with a city vibe and cool modern decor, look no further than Senses bar. PS the restaurant has some great offerings, but you will definitely find it even more expensive. Worthy of a special night out (say anniversary celebration etc).",positive
"I stayed at a corporate apartment across the street for a month and decided to try this place after trying Cora few times. $21 for all you can eat fancy style brunch is what they advertised. Ok. The place felt fancy. Large, comfy seats. Oversized tables. Went super early so got good service which eventually went down dramatically when it started filling up. For the food. It was very skimpy. Had tiny bowls with fruit, condiment bowls. Yogurt. Large sausages which were good. Potatoes which were ok. Bacon tray always just had few slices of bacon. Made to order omelet station that produced very bland and pathetic looking omelets. And toast. No French toast. No pancakes (they said you can order for extra and they'll put the order in upstairs. Come on.) Coffee was absolutely great however. I drank enough to fly out of there. All in all very plain (not fancy) brunch that lacked key brunch items for me, like French toast, pancakes, waffles, or eggs benedict. Go there if you want to pay $21 for egg and sausage breakfast with no frills except for table settings.",negative
"I was so lost in Toronto without my Yelp App (darn costly international phone plan) that I had to ask the concierge of my hotel...gasp... for a nearby lunch spot. And that's how I ended up dining here at Senses, which was conveniently located across the street from my hotel. Convenient indeed cause looked like there was a storm on the way. When I first sat down I asked for a refreshing glass of lemonade and the waitress offered me strawberry lemonade or chili spicy lemonade. Chili spicy lemonade? Weird! I thought maybe it was a Canadian thing, but those I asked seemed to think it was just as strange. I opted for strawberry lemonade. As for my entree I ordered mini turkey burgers and sweet potato fries. The turkey burgers were just so-so, but I devoured all the sweet potato fries. Yum. The meal was a bit more expensive that I'd prefer, but I guess that's usually the case when eating at a restaurant connected to a hotel. All in all this did the trick of filling me up, but next time I'll do some more exploring on Yelp before choosing my destination.",negative
"SEN5ES has great atmosphere and service. Not a huge menu to select from but good choices. I had the venison carpaccio as my starter which tasted good with no game flavor to it (bravo!). It was just a tad bit on the salty side but other than that, it was filleted very thinly with an amazing texture to it. For my entrée, I had the roasted barbecue duck breast which went well together with the thai red curry sauce, although some pieces of the duck meat were a bit over cooked. Lastly, I had the raspberry crème brulee which was beautifully plated. So beautiful that I didn't even want to eat at first.... but I couldn't help myself ofcourse... and it tasted SUPER! (not too sweet and creamy - the way I like it). They also have a nice wine and cocktail selection where I ended up going with the 'sinful cocktail' as a recommendation from a friend and it tasted just amazing! Overall, it was a fancy restaurant serving okay tasting food.",negative
"(This is a review of Senses Cafe/Bakery in the Soho Hotel - not to be confused with the Senses Restaurant there.) This is my first review. I know nothing really of reviews and thought at first I best write a nasty review cause that is easier and people will accept it better. Then I was having a coffee yesterday at the cafe in the building I live in and I thought, ""Oh right, duh!"" So review this place. A place I know. I've lived here for over three years. There's a resto a bar and a cafe/bakery. I do almost daily meetings in the cafe or on its mini-patio - six chairs sitting outside on the corner through the brief non-winter season here. The coffee is fine. $2.25. It never makes me feel good to watch an espresso have hot water poured over it in front of me - just reminds me of when Ive made instant coffee. But that's what an Americano is, so I just look away. The great pastries are all going stale after 2pm. But they mean for their pastries to be bought by 10am anyway. The service staff is geared to specific tasks, by management, that do not synch with reality so on weekends there may be only one person on the floor while table service goes to hell. This is not a reflection of lack of desire by the staff to serve you well. It is worth noting that they serve brunch and then breakfast and lunch and then will not serve food to you except for pre-made sandwiches after about 2pm and the kitchen opens again round 5pm and the cafe remains open til about 6pm. One thing worth noting is that there is an all you can eat morning buffet breakfast that is about $20 I think. It is part self serve, part made to order in front of you. It has an excellent range of foods - the obvious - bacon/sausage, great home fries, but also fresh fruits and graved lax, muesli/granola/yoghurt, fresh made heavenly pancakes (they may get stupid and pretty them up with confectionary sugar - avoid it) with unlimited real maple syrup. There's all sorts of foods of course but for me the highlight is that, since the owner also owns Lai Wah Heen (a noted Chinese restaurant), there is also steamed dim sum which is succulent. I love it every time. I once told the management at Senses that their price on their brunch is only a few dollars more than Cora's across the street - Cora's is about $16 for the Cora's Special with coffee and tip. At the time the Senses brunch was only $16 - they soon corrected for this since you do get much better than diner food, all you can eat of it, and no 30 minute line-up waiting outside in the cold. What's new for Senses? They removed both the ""High Table"", a communal table that was a great feel but had horrible trouble for sliding your highchair up to the table, and the casual lounge seating that was enjoyed by many. It just chills the place out a little reducing a nice warmth that I and many had enjoyed for years. It now looks all business, no charm. Okay, I'm new to writing this sort of thing and just decided to start writing anything here. I'll do better next time. Advice is welcomed. Here's a great deal right now: http://www.groupon.com/deals/senses-restaurant-and-bar-toronto?utm_campaign=senses-restaurant-and-bar-toronto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;c=btn&amp;addx=thefabulousmsjmc@yahoo.ca",positive
"I bought a cake here for a birthday. The cake tasted blah. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Definitely not worth the $40 I spent on it though. The cake could have been a lot moister. Not sure if I will try another cake from here again, because the price was high and couldn't justify it when comparing it to the taste. I rather prefer the cakes you can get at Decadent Desserts (where they sell Dufflet's, and some other top of the line cakes for $20-$30 each)",negative
"According to the SMOQ PITT Facebook page, they closed as of Jan. 29, 2017. Such a shame because their food was wonderful and the staff was very friendly. They'll be missed for sure!!!",positive
"Soooooo freaking delicious!!! Do yourself a favor and eat here ASAP! We shared the 3 meat combo; st louis ribs, sliced brisket and pulled pork with two sides... it was more than enough to stuff us! The ribs were to die for! Homemade sauces, moist cornbread and good prices! This gal is a happy yelper!",positive
"It takes more than slow-smoked proteins to make good barbeque - that is the impression I was left with after my visit to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. On my first visit I decided to try a brisket sandwich with macaroni and cheese. I was served a deflated, soggy bun which was glistening with grease, overflowing with what appeared to be a generous pile of smoked brisket. As I took my first bite it became immediately clear that the entire sandwich was comprised of 40% tasty, nicely barked brisket and 60% oozing, gelatinous fat. The macaroni and cheese had even less curb appeal, yet managed to disappoint even more so than the sandwich. Anticipating a rich, creamy cheese sauce coating al dente elbow noodles. Imagine my disappointment as I was served overcooked pasta soaked in butter with no discernible (and certainly no natural) cheese to be found. Advice to the proprietor: - Trim your meat! Brisket isn't marbled like Butt - even if you are going to cheap out and leave ALL the fat on, do a better job of chopping and blending to hide your sin. - I'm still speechless about the macaroni. You would have been better off serving Kraft. - Seasoned french fries are yummy - but not when they are caked with a kilogram of salt, paprika and what, a dozen other ground herbs? Less is more and the fries were almost inedible.",negative
"We had the brisket and baby back ribs. All very good. Having a choice between three sauces was nice, spicy, sweet and tangy. Not the best I've ever had, for me that is Clem's in Blairsville, PA",positive
"To quote my husband, ""Wow!!! Just wow!"" Tried this place on a whim for pick up (since we live down the road) and holy hell...is it good!!!! Homemade everything! You can tell they make their own BBQ sauce, spicy baked beans, sweet coleslaw, onion rings and more. The wings are the double wings, with drum and flats and are friggin huge. Crispy outside and moist juicy inside. Loved the St. Louis ribs and loved their Mac and cheese even more. Not only was our pick up super fast but you could tell they put a lot into the take out process. Wetnaps, forks, napkins, tons of little ramekins full of their homemade sweet BBQ sauce. My husband calls them lil cups with lids but they are RAMAKINS! Lol. Kid you not, every item had its own container, nothing was thrown together, everything in its rightful place. I must warn you though, this place is not for the bird appetite people out there. You fill up quickly on the heavy-stick to your bone-items on the menu. So stretch out your tummy, go prepared and enjoy every bite!!!! Merica!!!",positive
We stopped in on Friday at about 6:30pm and places a to go order. There was a couple in front of us and we walked up to the counter and stood for about 10 minutes and no one uttered a word or acknowledgement to us of any kind. Finally I interrupted a girl that was busy looking very confused doing nothing but watching another girl work. I asked if I could place an order? Which after a few more minutes she finally took our order. She had us repeat our order multiple times because she was so confused on getting it entered into the I pad. Then she said it would be about 20 minutes. We paid and waited 20 minutes. We went back in and she looked very confused and stressed and said it would be at least another 10-15 minutes. We are here right now still waiting. No matter how good the food is we will not be back.,negative
"I've been here several times, but as someone else mentioned, they have a Groupon deal/s which are pretty awesome, so we ordered take out on a Friday night. There were a few tables filled and another person getting take out, so I waited in the line as the delicious smoke filled my lungs. If you don't like smoked meats, you won't like their bbq. It's super smokey! I ordered a half rack with fries and a 2 meats, 2 sides with ribs, pulled pork, yams and onion rings. The meats are awesome - fall off the bone delicious with some great flavor. I always order them naked, so I can try the three sauces. To me, the spicy is too spicy, the sweet a bit too sweet, but I love the tangy which is mustard based and perfect. My husband prefers the sweet. I'd never had the yams or the onion rings and I have to say that the onion rings are hands down the best onion rings I have ever had. Super crunchy and crispy with a nice piece of onion that isn't stringy. The fries are always awesome and the yams taste just sweet enough without being overpowering. I also ordered the bread pudding, which was a mistake and which is why they don't get 5 stars. It tasted like white bread was dipped in pork smoke grease and then put into the bread pudding mold and slathered in honey and bourbon. I am not sure what they were intending, but they really should just not serve desserts rather than serve this. Thankfully, even the awful bread pudding did not dissuade me from saying that this is one of my favorite bbq joints in town.",positive
"Tried four different meats, by far loved the St. louis the most then the pulled pork. Fries are also very good. Lemonade is very tasty!",positive
"We ordered take out and it was delicious. We got pulled pork, brisket and chicken. The chicken was my favorite. My kids loved the mac n cheese. We'll definitely order again.",positive
"Got 3 meat 2 sides. Got discount since used yelp so thats a plus. Nice portions. Mac n cheese and fries were very good and seasoned. Brisket was chopped and fatty but still good. Pulled pork was awesome. I didnt eat everything at once but took the ribs for lunch and def not pull off the bone. I def had to work. Flavor good, sauces are good. I would go again.",positive
"My husband loves all things smothered in bbq sauce, and this place is no exception. The environment is casual, and the food is good. We both enjoyed our pulled pork sandwiches. Oddly, the baked beans weren't ready during the lunch hour, so we tried the green beans and sweet potatoes instead. The beans were crispy and delicious. The potatoes almost tasted like pumpkin pie. My husband loved them.",positive
"Smoq has the best smoked beef brisket bbq we have found in Pittsburgh. The flavor was excellent, and the slices had a good balance and variation of leanness (wet and dry beef). Having lived in Texas for 25 years, I guarantee this sliced brisket would do very well in Houston, Austin or anywhere in Texas. The three available bbq sauces are tangy with a mustard flavor, sweet and spicy. We have eaten here twice now, and for me mixing the sweet and spicy sauces works great. The cornbread is excellent. It comes jalapeno or regular. Next time I may make my two sides cornbread and cornbread. It is made as muffins, so every piece has both the nicely-textured edge and the warm, soft center. Cooked corn kernels add to the nice texture and taste. The cole slaw was better than most. It was light without a heavy mayo base like slaw has in some places. The baked beans were average and the mac and cheese just above average in taste, but who cares when the smoked brisket is this good!!! In some Pittsburgh restaurants, bbq brisket is not available until after 5:00. At Smoq, you can have smoked brisket for lunch or dinner! Smoq is a small, very informal hole in the wall sort of place right in the heart of Brookline. The service was very friendly, prompt and competent. I will go back, I will tell friends, and I plan to use takeout to make this outstanding bbq the theme of a party.",positive
This place has the best barbecue in Pittsburgh! It is so good. The beef ribs are so tender and delicious. I got a Groupon for $20. The portions here are huge! I highly recommend it.,positive
"I saw them at Eat.Drink.Pittsburgh last weekend. They had the best food there... pulled pork sandwiches were great They added some vinegar which was surprisingly good. I will be trying this myself. The pork belly sliders were cooked to perfection. The fat was just perfectly crisp. Their brisket could have stayed in the smoker for a few more hours. It wasn't quite as tender as I like but tasted great. I chalked that up to having to prepare for the event and the mass quantities needed. Their sides were good also. Cornbread, mac n cheese, slaw... all top notch. I only tried their tangy sauce. It was good. Next time, I'm going to see if they have anything with more heat. Smoq Pit may be the best BBQ in the city so far. I don't go out for BBQ much because I prefer to smoke my own pork, ribs, brisket, etc at home. Next time I need a quick fix, I'm headed to the Smoq Pit.",positive
"On this first day of spring with the snow flying and a fire glowing in the fireplace as the Bird and I began watching Jesus of Nazareth to begin Holy Week it wasn't too soon when thoughts of dinner were brought up. We both agreed that we did not want to venture out nor cook anything ourselves so delivery options were discussed. I pulled up Yelp and came across Smoq Pit BBQ. COMFORT FOOD! When I read that they delivered our excitement grew. We explored the menu and I called to place our orders. After confirming that we were within the 5 mile delivery area I continued to order. I went with the 2 meat option and chose the brisket and half rack ofSt. Louis. This came with two sides but I just asked for a double order of coleslaw. The person who took my order was very patient, Dana or Diane I believe, and suggested I sample all of the sauces. The Bird ordered a special sandwich that had brisket and coleslaw. Her side was the Mac and cheese but also ordered the corn bread and bread pudding. We were told we could pay with debit card and that it would be 45-60 min. Ding Dong....40 minutes later the food arrived. A good sign was that the bag was heavy. When pulling out the containers we were both pleased that everything was larger than expected. The sides were normal. The ribs were excellent. I did not need a knife as everything was easily pulled from the bones. Of the three sauces, tangy (mustard), sweet bbq, or spicy bbq I liked the sweet the best whereas The Bird liked the Spicy. They were all very good. The brisket was above par as well. My coleslaw, which is a vinegar based, was not my favorite ...at first. I was going to abandon it until I poured the tangy sauce in it and mixed it up. It tasted like the two belonged together. The Bird liked her Mac & Cheese and said the Corn Bread was excellent. She only had a small piece of the bourbon bread pudding. She loved it. She could not eat all of the Bread Pudding as she did finish the giant sandwich. It was too big for her so she had to remove the top bun and eat it open faced. We both agreed that the Smoq Pit will be part of our delivery options this summer.",positive
"We tried this place for the first time on Tuesday.. My kids ordered chicken fries and corn bread they both ate their food which is always a good sign... My husband had the St. Louis style ribs, fries, Mac and cheese and corn bread and I had the beef ribs, slaw and cornbread.. Everything was really good. Portions were big, the staff were friendly and we didn't wait long at all.. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because we were a little dissapointed with the Mac and cheese it we absolutely loved everything else...Don't forget to order a S'mores pie mmmm so good!",positive
"I am not a big BBQ lover but I loved Smoq Pitt. Bought a groupon and decided to order takeout on a Saturday night. The place was packed! So so busy. Luckily, we got our order quickly. We ordered half racks of Baby Back Ribs and St Louis Ribs, mac and cheese, and cornbread. We went with the Sweet sauce. The ribs and sauce were delicious. So much food! We will definitely be back!",positive
There are few bbq places in Pgh to begin with and especially in the winter time. To be able to order bbq delivery when it's 9 degrees outside is awesome. The pulled pork is delicious and my son loved the Mac n Cheese. The meat portion is large enough for me to have a few more meals from it too. Found my new go to bbq place.,positive
"I stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father. We had been in the previous BBQ shop to grace this spot and enjoyed it so whenever I saw that a new one had opened up, we headed over to Brookline to give it a try. The inside of the restaurant wasn't that much different than in its previous incarnation. As soon as you walk in there is seating for about 20 or so people on the right with picnic plaid covering the tables and then there is a counter right in front of you. Other than that this place has a cool feel to it as the walls have a distressed look and there are a number of older signs on the wall including a Coca-Cola sign that looks like it was used for target practice at one point in time. For lunch I decided to order the special of the day which was the Sam and Ema brisket, pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich and for my side I decided on the mac and cheese. My father ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich and at the last minute changed his side to the fries. After only about a 10 minute wait, during which my father and I enjoyed watching the Price Is Right on the only TV in the restaurant, our food was brought out to us. My meal came out first and the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. The sandwich was simply massive and I knew right away that it wasn't going to be easy to keep it on the bun. That proved to be the only downfall of the sandwich as well because both the brisket and pulled pork were tender, moist and had a great smoky flavor to them. The cole slaw was a nice addition as well as it gave the sandwich some extra moisture but that also caused the sandwich to collapse about half way through eating it and I ended up finishing it with my fork. The sam. Since the bun was fairly mushy and was not toasted at",positive
"Great bbq in Pittsburgh,smokey with great sauces..The ribs were great and so was the pulled pork..will go back again to try the chicken. you could tell the food was smoked for hours the old fashioned way.very friendly service",positive
"Great pulled pork! Huge portions. The mac n cheese is pretty good too. Highly recommend trying them for lunch. Pricing is ok. Once you try it, the price feels a little better.",positive
"The best pulled pork in the Burgh. Tender, but not too limp and very tasty. Excellent cole slaw. My partner loved her baby back ribs. Service was fast and friendly.",positive
"Let me start by saying I wanted to like this place so much! Myself and 2 friends decided to give this new BBQ place a try. We ordered delivery because it was a beautiful Sunday and we were out swimming. Since this is a new place, and none of us had yet tried it, we ordered the 4 meats (pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket) which came with 2 sides (onion rings, mac and cheese), as well as an ordering an additional side of mac and cheese, and a side of cornbread. Where to start... The pulled Pork was ok. Nothing special. Had I known how the rest of the food was going to taste, I would have hoarded this for just myself! The chicken was ok on taste, however, it was so burned on the outside and so dry on the inside that when you physically tried to chew it, the meat disintegrated in your mouth - this was the most unusual thing that I have ever experienced as far as textures are concerned - think astronaut ice cream. The ribs - terrible, these actually tasted like they weren't cooked all the way, so we all took 1 bite of our rib and threw it away. Onto the brisket - this was ok, nothing special. Very similar to the Pork - nothing to write home about. The sauces were just weird as well. The spicy sauce was the agreed upon favorite. The sweet sauce had so much nutmeg in it that we thought we were eating pumpkin pie! On a good note, it was preparing us for the pending arrival of fall. The tangy sauce - well it just tasted like watered down mustard - no thanks. Onto the sides shall we, because after all at this point the 3 of us have had to split the equivalent of 1 pulled pork and 1 brisket sandwich. The mac and cheese was disgusting. It had zero flavor and was so gritty that we questioned if there was actual sand in it. The onion ring on the other hand were amazing - the 3 of us fought over the 7 onion rings that classified as a side. Now for the Trump Card - the cornbread......I am pretty sure I will never look at cornbread ever again. Lucky for me, I couldn't get it past my nose and into my mouth. I wish I would have thought to take a picture of it. The corn""bread"" was practically raw, and had the consistency of the corn cake that Chi Chi's used to serve (which II loved!). Here is what go us - it was wrapped in aluminum foil and as soon as I opened it up, the entire area around us smelled like mildew! Friend actually put it in his mouth and immediately spit it out and was basically choking on it! After the smell of it and that response to tasting it, I passed and decided that a dissection would be better suited for this.....and low and behold, there was mildew! Do not waste your time or your money! I would have rather either a loaf of plain white bread then this, and it would have saved me $40 (it was my turn to buy)! Normally I would give a place a second chance if the food was as good as I expected or if they also had some good ratings to convince me that it was a fluke thing. They should be embarrassed to serve this, especially to paying customers!",negative
"This place is very good; we ate here last week and got delivery. Ordering over the phone wasn't the best because the girl had a little attitude for us ordering a lot but the food was worth it! Their pulled pork is amazing! I would not recommend their ""tangy sauce"" but their sweet sauce was very good and unique! Their brisket was good minus the excess fat & the ribs are good. The mac & cheese didn't seem fresh but the corn bread was good minus the corn in it. Two down sides; The online ordering on Grub Hub never seems available. Also, they don't sell 2 liters of soda. Over all, awesome little place.",positive
"Yeah, about as great BBQ as you are going to find, not just in PGH -- anywhere. That is what happens when low and slooooowwwwww meets up with the right hardwoods, rubs and sauces. Check out the prices. Double for this high quality in most towns. The sides are solid. Plate or sandwich: beautiful. The chicken is spot on. And the chicken wings are a nuts bargain, so big and meaty. Took a long time for Pittsburgh to get some swell barbeque, but this guy Mitch from Rockwell, IL brought it on home.",positive
"I have been here a couple times and so far I am a fan. I typically get the 2 meat platter and 2 sides. The brisket has always been spot on and I add a little bit of the spicy sauce and go to town. The ribs can sometimes be inconsistent, I have had them just perfect while other times they seem to be a little dry and burnt. When the ribs are good, I don't even put sauce on them. When they are a little off I wonder why I just didn't get more brisket instead. When it comes to the sides I always get the mac and cheese and whatever vegetable they have that day. From what I can tell the veggies always seem to be fresh and not from a can. I also recommend checking out their facebook page or twitter since they sometimes mix it up and have special items just for that day. They recently had pork belly and prior to that these chicken wings that had some of the best seasoning I ever tasted. Yes, sometimes they will run out of certain items as does any good BBQ place. Good BBQ takes a while to cook. You don't want to go to some place that just has frozen garbage on hand that they pop in a microwave at any time. I would almost be skeptical of a BBQ place that doesn't run out of certain items. They also get bonus points for staying open a little later than most of the other restaurants in the area. Not everyone eats dinner at 4PM! Alright an update after eating at this place for close to a year. It's still a solid option for BBQ in the area. I did however finally figure out why sometimes it can be a little inconsistent and the meat is a little dry. If you see a taller black guy cooking, just walk out and try again on another day. When he is cooking the food is always dry and sometimes cold.",positive
"After trying to find the taste of Brookline which actually didn't exist this year, we stumbled upon SMOQ. The inside is quite small with only a few tables and a counter. We reviewed the menu on the chalkboard and ordered at the counter. There was a small basket of dumb dumbs and starbursts for the taking in the counter. I was a little disappointed in their drink section. They had a very limited selection of bottled and canned beverages. I was told that they are BYOB. Hubs and I decided to go with the three meat platter in order to try a few options. We sat down and were served rather quickly. Our meal came out on a tray which we put between us. We were offered one of their sauces on the side but opted to try all three. My favorite was definitely the spicy sauce but hubs preferred the sweet. I proceeded to dig into the pulled pork. I was immediately impressed. Tender, juicy with a great smoky flavor. The brisket was also very good though I thought it lacked the depth of flavor I loved about the pulled pork. The chicken was my least favorite of the three options as it was a little dry for my taste. As for the sides, the fries were great but the mac and cheese was a bit watery and lacked richness. Overall, SMOQ is off to a great start. We will be back soon!",positive
"No no no no no!!!!!! I'm so disappointed. Here's some bullet points: - clearly stated on the menu under SIDES (and on the board in this joint) A TASTE OF RIBS. Fiancé ordered it- ribs aren't a side. Okay, fine strike 1. - ordered pulled pork, at a bbq joint. Out of pulled pork. Okay, thanks anyway . Strike 2 - we both got brisket plate with 2 sides. Food came out fast and it looked like we ordered appetizers. Well our bill was $30 so hopefully the taste matches the price. - my fiancé loved the brisket . I ate some of mine and gave the rest to him. Wasn't impressed. -his baked beans looked more like bean soup. -the macaroni and cheese had ZERO flavor. And I mean zero. I put bbq sauce on it for some sort of taste. Still couldn't bear it. Strike 3. - cornbread was good. Not going back.",negative
"Yesterday my fiance and I decided to order some take out from this place while we were on our way home from the store. We had wedding projects to do, so we just ordered some take out. The ONLY reason I would give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the order online feature on their website wasn't working. Also, you are required to pay with a credit card when you order online, you can't just order and pay with cash when you come in. ANYWAY, back to the important parts. When we called to order, the women who answered was very friendly and professional and she said the food would be ready in less than 15 minutes (which anything under 20 is very exciting for me). **DISCLAIMER: I am a total wimp when it comes to spicy things, so take what I have to say about the sauce knowing that Buffalo Chicken Dip is usually too spicy for me. moving on! Let me just say, the pulled pork and the chicken were SO GOOD! The quality of the meat was excellent... now for the sauces... I'll be honest, I didn't try the spicy or the tangy because I'm a crybaby, but I will say that my fiance (who is a huge fan of sauces that make him sweat) LOVED the spicy sauce. He said it was the kind of sauce that the spicy creeps up on you and builds up the more you eat. He wasn't a fan of the tangy. Now for the sweet. You can definitely taste the honey in this one, which is fine by me because it is like a meat candy coating (yum). HOWEVER, there is a kick to it... and it also creeps up on you. By the time I was done with my pulled pork, I was running to the kitchen to grab some milk to help ease the spice. Again, it may not be spicy at all, but it was spicy to me.. but still enjoyable! The flavor was excellent. We also got the mac n cheese-- it wasn't bad, nor the best. I'd say it needs a bit more salt, some breadcrumbs, and maybe a more flavorful cheese combo. Cole Slaw- vinegar based. not bad, i'll get it again. Moral of the story: This place is freakin delicious and we are so excited to have an AWESOME BBQ place within walking distance from our house. We're excited to try the other sides, and we'll be back sooner rather than later.",positive
"Stopped in for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised. All meat is grass fed and hormone free. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Small dining area, clean and tidy. I will definitely be back!",positive
"Food and service was horrible. The owner was holding back food because he told us we only allow to order 60 pcs per order so this way the restaurant have enough food to serve for ""later"" reservation . My family loves sashimi . We noticed every time we order more sashimi, they served is smaller pieces . Also, my family had to pulled this waiter teeth if the meal comes with dessert . It appears that they don't want to serve dessert.",negative
"If there was an option of 0 stars I would've rated that. We received the worst service ever the minute we walked in. The male greeter was really rude when we did nothing wrong to upset him. At first, I thought he was just stressed and exhausted at how busy it was so I didn't get so bothered at first with how rude he was but after reading previous recent reviews, it seems like lot's of other people also complained about him. After a long wait of about 30 minutes, we asked him how long it was going to be still. He started to get frustrated with us when all we did was ask a simple question. Kept saying ""give me a minute!"" in a rude tone. I noticed he got frustrated with other customers as well. He should be fired. We didn't have a reservation that day but the people who did have reservations ALSO had to wait as long as us. Must be that their service is really slow. I was really looking forward to try their food so I'll maybe come back to try it but it seems their food isn't even that good after reading other people's reviews of this place. This place seems like a place I'd go once and never come back, the environment and people working here is not something you'll want to come back to. Sorry.",negative
"Literally the worst experience I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant- Even the Spoon and Fork In Vaughan THE SAME FOOD except the quality of the food here is -10 and the Vaughan location is +10. To be honest I am still sitting trying to find things I like of off this menu as everything I've tried so far tastes bad/sour or bland- the only thing I can applaud them on is the Salmon Teriyaki, Beef tataki and the Escargots (please tell me how I can fill up on those ) I'm dreading paying for this - at a restaurant like this especially with the lovely atmosphere you would assume the quality quantity and taste would be top of the line - would not recommend",negative
"The food was okay, but they forgot our reservation on a busy day. The restaurant was too cold and they gave us a table by the entrance door. We were freezing while eating. We asked to move the table to inside but they said that the empty tables inside were fully reserved. We like Spoon and Fork in Etobicoke, but today's experience at their new location ruined our family lunch.",negative
"Just ordered (via Uber Eats) and was very disappointed. We chose this place because of the Bento Box option which states: ""Chicken Teriyaki, gyoza, green salad, vegetable and rice"". We ordered two orders. The orders took over 30 minutes to prepare and we received only chicken, vegetables and rice. No gyoza (which was the draw for us) and no salad. On top of that the chicken was hard as a rock. We are always prepared for delivery to not taste as fresh as dine in but this was far beyond that. We will not order from them again. Over $50 for rock hard chicken, some rice and carrots and broccoli. Two thumbs down!",negative
"Was most appreciative of Julia's attention to my shrimp allergy. Food was fast coming out but two dishes were way too spicy and salty, respectively. Other than that, great atmosphere, comfortable seating and good service.",positive
"Average place with lots of food options. We went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy. Thai, Japanese and other fare including escargot. Drinks are not included in the Ayce menu and no refills. Each person gets 3 small dessert portions at the dinners end, which was good. Food overall tasted ok and the sushi/sashimi a little less than average. Maybe we'll go again but maybe not. If you want to try different types of foods than I recommend but don't expect anything to stand out taste wise.",negative
"Food: 0.5/5 Service: 1/5 Positive reviews: outright lies I am absolutely furious at the disservice the positive, and likely fake or insincere, reviews for this restaurant cause. To note, as I write this it is 4:40am on a Tuesday morning. The reason for this is that the previous evening, I had dined at the AYCE for ~30$ and was served the worst sushi I have ever had, bar non, paired with the worst service at any restaurant I've ever experienced across 14 countries over 30 years of my life. Now I'm unwell. And this is not hyperbole. Nor is this an unrestrained review, I am holding back for the sake of propriety. The food: was not fresh, not sushi grade quality, and was very obviously slapped together in some crude fashion (see attached images). Not only did it look like whomever made the main rolls did not know what they were doing, but it was apparent that they were trying to con us --the rolls only had fish a quarter of the way through, the bottom half+ was hollow!!!!!!!!! The sashimi was oddly moist, WARM, and a sliver of a morsel (see attached). The first few times, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. But it was apparent that it was intentional. The soy sauce was in a drip bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you did not vigorously shake the bottle, you would sit there as it slowly dripped out. Are they mad!? They present themselves as an upmarket sushi restaurant, but force you to make an arse of yourself pouring SOY SAUCE??? And what's rich is that when we inquired about a low sodium soy sauce option, the owner himself stated rather frankly that they water the soy sauce down so it's low sodium by virtue of the water in it. And from the colour, just a bit darker than tea, he was being honest. Never have I seen such outrageous attempts to cheat someone in my life! It's Pacific Mall's essence manifested in a restaurant: Cheap knockoffs being pushed by crooked, dishonest, and greedy merchants. The service: without exception, the worst I've had for the price ($80/2 people). The owner himself sat us down, then proceeded to condescendingly inform us of what AYCE was, and how to operate a primitive iOS menu app. He was talking about it as if he was trying to explain to an imbecile which orifice to insert food into! As mentioned previously, he also said the soy was watered down and implying that thus it qualified as ""low sodium"", and before we had given any indication that we doubted him, he challenged us with an offer to go and fetch the bottles from the back for our inspection. I'll leave that there. The waiting staff were a total of two for what was approximately 50-70+ diners. Once more, not hyperbole. Again, a sign of distasteful frugality --the last characterisation you would want where you eat. As it used an ipad menu, food options were keyed in. However, unlike every other AYCE sushi place, the waiting staff or owner would have to come and enter a confirmation code. Only afterward would your order go through. So, what should have been a convenience, quickly became a nightmare. We would order food, thinking it was being made, but in fact nothing had gone through. We would sit and patiently wait, and after the first 15 minutes or so, would inquire after our meal, only then to be told that 1 of 3 people could confirm it and that in fact nothing had gone through. Learning quickly, we would key in our subsequent selections, and try to get them to confirm it promptly. But they seemed to actively avoid our table. I say this because the cash machine was directly behind us, and we tried to get their attention multiple times. At one point, one of the servers noticed we were trying to get her attention, and the owner seemed to hold her back and direct her to a non-AYCE table. Paranoid? Hardly, when we asked the owner why he needed to confirm the order earlier, he rudely spat, and I quote verbatim, ""because otherwise customers would order and order and I would go bankrupt"" (what's missing is the heavy Chinese accent, but otherwise word for word). Taken together with the unsatisfactory, sloppy, outright bad sushi, and the service, I was fuming. To summarise, it was down right terrible overall and the positive reviews (especially the ""elite"" reviewers) might well be paid or from a review farm given how alarmingly inaccurate they are. This from someone who worked in the social media marketing industry.",negative
"I just came back for my second time today and it was just as good as it was a few years back when I first went. The sushi/sashimi was extremely fresh as was everything else. Also enjoyed clam chowder, butter chicken and grilled skewers. Very filling lunch. Don't expect any dessert for ayce lunch menu; besides I don't have a craving for sweets, so this is fine by me. I know others may expect dessert, but for the price I understand why they don't offer it.",positive
"This spoon and fork is located in North York - much different from the one in Vaughan. Upon first look, in the parking lot - there aren't many parking spots. Going in, it's very nice, the decor is nice, the staff were very friendly and I went early in the day, so it was pretty quiet. The food was really amazing, the salmon sashimi - not as fresh as Vaughan's location but the escargot was AWESOME. The calamari and shrimp tempura were to die for. You're probably wondering why I gave three stars by this point. One, none of the staff were ever smiling. They got orders wrong and were all over the place. Secondly, there is no ice cream machine at this location. How is it spoon and fork PLUS without an ice cream machine?! The dessert menu is completely separate. When asking the owner why - he said they just don't have a machine. Well, considering I'm paying the same price as the Vaughan location... that's not a very great excuse. 3.5/5",negative
"I've had a good couple of experiences with Spoon and Fork. First experience was when we ordered in a plethora of different dishes to the office for lunch. Spoon and Fork seemed to be the best option for our group, offering a wide range of dishes from everywhere...Green curry! Mango Fried Rice! Caesar Salad! A strange but awesome mixture of whatever you're looking for can be found here. Second experience - was looking for a 'winter warmer' (ie. soup!) and came here for some wonton soup - very nice, although I was tempted by their $12 lunch menu where you can pick a full meal out of 15 or so options and it's $12. I'll definitely have to come back and take advantage of that, and on a hungrier day...their AYCE tasting menu! It's also very reasonably priced ($19 is the price when I went at lunch). Very nice inside and larger than expected. The plaza it's in is kinda terrible though, and parking is scarce especially at lunch. If you go around the side, there is garage parking. Kinda tucked away, but it helps on those days where spots out front are just non-existent!",positive
"Damm... this place was not what I've expected as to the ratings I've read. I booked a table for 8 people for dinner on New Years Eve - Called and Spoon & Fork Plus had space which was amazing because I thought everywhere would be booked up. Originally wanted to go to Dragon Pearl Buffet but it was full so settled for this instead since it is a new place and it doesn't hurt to experience new places! :) Came in, and the place was all fancy looking and quite nicely decorated. We came in slightly earlier for our reservation and everything was smooth. I guess this is where it goes downhill. Not really the restaurant's fault but we were seated at the booths and the booths were connected to the other table. The booth connected to us had a little kid that kept jumping up and down which was annoying. For an AYCE though, they do have tons of different options which I liked - especially the pasta options. However, being diverse, they certainly didn't excel in any of the food. The pad thai was pretty flavourless to me and the Japanese food/sushi wasn't anything special. Since it was an ayce, I didn't expect the quality to be good, and no doubt that I only liked the linguine dish (forgot the actual name) and I tried about 4 different pastas options. The miso soup also tasted odd. Service was pretty non-existent, after our waiter served us water, that was pretty much it and no one really attended to us. We also had to call our waiter everytime we submitted our order, and it was hard to flag down a person... It was only at the end that he refilled our water when we called for the bill since he had to wait for payment anyways but thanks for trying.. Also don't get why there was so much space on the sushi places - they couldhv fit more of our sushi dishes together onto one plate but I guess it was all about presentation. Our table was filled with food and had no space at one point... The food arrived promptly but they DEFINITELY MISSED a lot of our orders - including the escargot and since waiters are hard to get, we just kept ordering more but still, none showed up at all!! & according to the reviews, the escargot was good and I was looking forward to that... Also ordered the Sirloin Steak and Teriyaki beef which came in one huge piece and they did not provide knives... tried to bite the meat but even then it was hard and not chewy aka disappointing. PS: there was NO dessert menu for the AYCE! Which was disappointing again because for the price they've set at, I'm sure they could have accommodated to a dessert menu. Since we were a big group, the service charge was already added in to the bill... With no dessert or excelling in any of the food (especially thai or italian since they're not usually in AYCE), I rather go somewhere else that is good in their speciality cuisine (eg: Japanese) and offers dessert due to the value in price.",negative
"japanese, thai, itallian, all you can eat. Eel sashimi was the best, they had great entree's like lamb chops, steak and veal. Also chicken and salmon filet but those are common. Surprised to see dim sum items, soup of the day and also the amount of appetizers they had. Everything tasted great and the sashimi was fresh. I'd definitely go again, recommend the Eel sashimi, veal and lamb chops. MUST HAVE",positive
"Really is an ""all you can taste"" menu, the portions are pretty small. Good is pretty good and they have iPad ordering which is neat.",positive
"My wife and I both LOVE Spoon and Fork Plus. The staff are friendly, food is fantastic, and the experience is PHENOMENAL. We've been going to Spoon and Fork Plus regularly for the past two years, and it is undoubtedly one of our favorite restaurants in Toronto. Highly recommended - chances are you'll see us there :)",positive
"I am a regular here but today i had the worst service. Some old gentleman who looked like an owner made me and my guests wait 15min when we could clearly see the empty seats. And then kept on asking us if we have more members coming or not, i have no idea why that was important. He kept on passing our table frowning upon us and threw dishes on our table. Also sushi we got had so much rice in it we couldnt eat them without chocking. Maybe the owner changed? Its the worst visit i have ever experienced and will never return again. For a quality ayct buffet this is unacceptable. (Waiters were nice though)",negative
"People were nice, but we ordered the bun and not dumplings that didn't arrive to us at all. Everything was overall okay, the chicken teriyaki, sweet and sour pork, and the crispy chicken or beef (don't remember what it was called) were pretty good. Got full really fast and didn't get to try everything. We didn't get refills on our soft drinks or anything ..",negative
What a pleasant surprise this place was! We tried to go to a restaurant in the Shops at Don Mills area but it was lined up out the door so we drove around the corner and are so happy we came across Spoon & Fork Plus! I think we have now been 4 times since discovering it a month or two ago... recommend it to anyone looking for good quality AYCE! Great atmosphere and decor. Perfect place for a bite to eat if you are staying at the Westin Prince... it's walkable and just across the street. Enjoy!,positive
"Japanese, Thai and Italian? How exotic of a restaurant. I came here last night with a group of 9 and everyone of us enjoyed our meal. The food quality is excellent especially considering it's an all you can taste restaurant. It costed 28.99 per person on a weeknight, plus beverages, plus desserts, plus tax, 15% tips ( automatically charged with groups of 8 or more ) If you're interested, we paid 460 for a group of 9. Ginger tea goes great with all you can taste dinners. Even though I gave a 5 star review, I must admit they need to improve their dessert game.",positive
"The manager was rude.I was with my whole family to celebrate my mom's bday that night.When we got inside i asked for a table of ten including kids,while waiting one of the fixtures beside the entrance fell into my 3 yr old nephew.Instead of asking if the kid was ok the manager started yelling at us and he told us that we should pay for it.I told him that thing was flimsy and its not the kids fault but he kept on yelling at us.My nephew felt bad he thought it was all his fault.Thats when we decided to left and take our business somewhere else.I've been to spoon & fork vaughan same bad experience.Food's great but customer service was sh@t.S&F york mills you should fire your manager,this guy doesnt know anything bout cx service.He does not represent the company's core values.",negative
Didn't try their buffet but did find a great sushi deal for all you yelpers! Their pre-made sushi sets in the fridge are 50% off after 5pm. Not sure if that's a daily deal but it applied yesterday (Monday) when I was there. Sushi was not bad! Great variety and quality for the value. Pretty good portion sizes too. My boyfriend got one set that had an 8-piece rainbow roll + 4 piece sashimi + 3 pieces of sushi. I got a set with 6 pieces of assorted sushi and 8-piece salmon and avocado roll. These sets cost between $10-$15 before the discount. Restaurant looked nice and their buffet menu looked interesting too. Might go back for the ayce now :),positive
Generally get to go orders here and everything I have had from the sushi to the meat dishes has been great. The all you can eat menu also looks great but have never personally tried it.,positive
"Delicious AYCE Japanese, Thai and Italian! Wait a second, one of these does not look like the other. Italian food at an Asian restaurant? Well, it works and the Italian food was good! My twelve year old cousin stuffed the pasta down his throat as fast as he did the spring rolls and said it was delicious. He's a picky little eater too. So, A+ Spoon and Fork! My cousin was full for a whole 10 minutes! No, but really, the place has good food. The only thing I was sad about was the lack of Blue Fine Tuna sashimi and sushi. Apparently, this is normal in Toronto? I think I'll stick to my DC sushi then. But from pasta, to lamb, to sashimi, to nigiri, to tataki, to spring rolls, it all good a yummy in my tummy rating from me. Just look at those pictures! Delicious! Also, the whole iPad thing was so cool. I've never seen it before, so it was awesome. I totally ordered way too much. But we ate it all anyway!",positive
"Grab and Go Sashimi box ($10) Fresh and delicious. Says 14 pieces on the box. It's definitely more than that. More like 20+ pieces. 2 red tuna, 3 white tuna/butter fish, 3 octopus, 3 red snapper, 6(?) salmon, 6 albacore tuna. Lemon on the side is quite nice. Their soy sauce comes not in a pack, but in box with a lid, so you can dip a lot easier. Would have taken a picture, but forgot cuz I was too busy chowing down.",positive
"Overpriced and really disorganized - and it wasn't even busy. Came here for Sunday lunch ""all you can eat"" and I was hoping it would be better. We ordered our first round of food and it took 20 minutes for the first dishes to arrive. It can't possibly take a them 20 minutes to boil edamame! Ordered 2 subsequent rounds of food and they took so long, we actually just cancelled our last round of food. Apparently our last order was missed and the manager said it would be 15 minutes if we wanted to wait. No time - had to catch a movie at Fairview. Food is mediocre - nothing to rave about. Not shockingly, the portions were really small, so if you're coming with more than a party of 2 and everyone wants to try the dish, double up.",negative
"I have been here twice and both times for AYCE dinner. Dinner is approximately $40 per person. The dinner menu has a lot of variety, but I do find that my family and I kept ordering the same items over and over again. The watermelon salad, caprese salad, beef tataki, cantaloupe and prosciutto salad were my favourites. I believe my sister and I each ordered 2-3 caprese salads and 2-3 watermelon salads. The fruits and vegetables were all really fresh, didn't have any problems with wilted greens. Everything else was pretty good, like the satay, Thai green curry, Thai sweet and sour fish, Pad Thai, etc. I can't exactly remember everything we order, but the only suggestion is stay away from the pastas. The gnocchi was gloopy, and the alfredo was mediocre. $40 is a tad pricey compared to most AYCE places, but considering that the menu has so much to offer and the quality of the food is quite good, I believe its worth the $40.",positive
One of the better all you can in I've had in a very long time! The food came so quickly! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions of everything! I would definitely come again.,positive
"My new favourite AYCE restaurant. It has so many options! The decor is very nice, the washrooms are super clean, the service was fantastic (handled our group of 15ish with ease), the food was super good quality and best part about the food was you can eat as much as you want! I cant wait to go back!",positive
We came on a Saturday evening with a large party. Other than the fact the orders between our 2 tables got mixed up. The food was amazingly good. I personally enjoyed the different cuisines - really liked the veal marsala. The sashimi was fresh and rolls were tasty. It is a bit on the pricy side. But we will come back for sure.,positive
"OMG where to begin?!?! First, don't let the location in a small strip mall scare you awSt. The restaurant is fancy yet casual in feel. Being my first night in Toronto, I wandered in to check it out since it was across from my hotel. While I perused the menu in front, the sweet bartender brought me a glass if water. Just a quick glance at the menu and I knew I wanted to have dinner here! I admit I was unclear about the tasting menu option. My waiter, Kyle, was great in explaining how it worked as well as making suggestions for a non-meat eater like me! Long story short, with the tasting menu you order whatever you want for $30. Most of the portions were too large in my opinion, so I imagine there is a lot of waste. Since I was dining alone, I couldn't share a dish with others which would be ideal! Below are the dishes I ordered: Beet salad Mango salad (delish) Hot & Sour soup Stuffed crab shell Stuffed shiitake mushroom (delish) Spicy tuna & spicy salmon sushi Golden Roll (4 pieces - too big) Butter fish takati Spicy Basil pad Thai (delish) Mac & cheese As you can see above, this was an insane amount of food! Needless to say I didn't even make it to the rice dishes (pineapple fried rice & crab fried rice were on my wish list) or main entrees (red curry Thai shrimp, spicy eggplant). My suggestion, am don't order sushi or things you know what it tastes like or you can easily get elsewhere (hot & sour soup). One caveat, in TINY print at the bottom it states to not order an excessive amount of food and if you leave leftovers, you will be charged. My waiter mentioned it when I finished and had asked how much food they throw out. So don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach!! Definitely check out Spoon & Fork Plus!!",positive
"Had the opportunity to hang out here. Terrific food, lovely staff, a nice layout with room for everyone. Very cozy. A good menu as their kitchen is shared with the restaurant next door. Nice wide windows which will be very nice in the summer, a patio outside. Just around the corner from St. Clair St.",positive
"Delicious coffee & treats, good sandwiches and soups, awesome baristas, casual neighbourhood vibe, cozy setting in the winter, bright in the summer",positive
"you toronto poseurs are such a joke! especially the reviewer comparing this place to a Parisienne cafe. I guess this little girl watches a lot of pretentious movies. I live there half the year. trust me, it's nowhere near the same, especially the pastries!! what a joke... The food is ok, not really fresh The ""croissants"" ar frozen things they buy offsite and heat up, often poorly the ""bacon"" in the chicken sandwich comes from a pre made batch, like the kind you reheat, from a store. i give it 2 stars for being better than McDonalds at least, but you trendy idiots make me sick. every weekend it's full of bloody parents and strollers. ugh! Paris awaits, and beckons! I can't wait to leave this wannabe city",negative
"Stella's is cute and small, with a hidden side seating area that reminds me of a cross between your grandma's and some hipster's living room. We went in today for the first time since didn't have time to make coffee before leaving the house. Their Americanos were reasonability priced ($4.20 all in for 2) and GOOOOOOOD! If you're in the neighbourhood and want a coffee, go to Stella's.",positive
"Stella's lunchbox is the ""little kid sister"" to Desotos (same owner). Highlights include a relaxed vibe, great music (either jazz or indie rock depending on who is working), amazing breakfast pastries (my current favorite is the apple galette), tasty panini sandwiches, and solid expresso drinks. I have always found the service to be top notch and friendly. Whether you need a place to hide and work on your laptop (they have free wifi, just ask for the password) or grab a quick lunch and/or coffee with friends, Stella's is perfect. The only thing I have found lacking at Stella's is a lack of power outlets...but upon my last visit I discovered they installed a new power bar with six sockets, upping my rating from a 4 to a 5 star!",positive
"This place looks really lovely and is unique to the Oakwood side of St clair west. The decor is inviting and warm. The food and service however, are a hit and miss. Ive had one really great crispy buttery delicious sandwich, and one soggy undercooked sandwich.. The server (tall guy with redish hair) doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about you. If you ask him how hes doing, he'll answer you with "" good."" and then look away... He's very aloof and slightly aggressive. He practically threw my tiny soggy sandwich at my after waiting 15 minutes.. The prices are a bit high as well. If my sandwich was crispy and buttery and delicious and hot, I wouldn't mind paying 12 dollars for it with a tiny americano. But Soggy, cold, and small served by an grown up toddler aint my thing. Maybe the quality of the sandwich depends on his mood. If thats what they're going for then there should be a mood scale on the wall. Or maybe they should hire someone who cares because this place has a lot of potential that is right now being chewed up and spat out by some dink. I hope Stella eventually rethinks who is representing her sweet cozy brand.",negative
"I don't know who Stella is, but I feel like I've sat in her living room and had coffee on her patio. Stella's is an ABSOLUTE gem right off of St. Clair W. The inside looks like a comfy, but hip living room with a fabulous coffee bar staffed by the friendliest of people. There's long worn wooden table for larger groups or getting to know your neighbours. The patio is tiny, but quaint. I feel like I'm sitting at a quiet Parisienne cafe. The boy and I shared a delicious grilled veggie panini and had a coffee each. The eggplant, zucchini and red pepper had a nice char, and still has good bite to it. The coffees were delicious and smooth. Our sweet tooth wasn't aching that day, but if it was, there were delicious raspberry scones and mini chocolates to remedy that at anytime. I have a feeling this will become my local coffee haunt. So if you're in the area, come visit Stella and I'll probably be there too!",positive
"I really enjoyed this place but I prefer Cynthia's Paradise over Taka. The prices are very similar and Taka has very limited selection in food and sushi. What I really enjoyed at this place was the the spider roll. It was absolutely amazing. That is one thing that Cynthias doesn't have on their menu. The fried soft shell crab was so tender and crispy. Their miso soup, seaweed salad was okay. Tempera shrimp was delicious and their bbq eel sushi. I really enjoyed their spicy salmon sushi, those were so yummy and better than the maki. I never really like shu mai but over here, their shu mai was delicious and juicy. The vibe of this restaurant was low-key and intimate. It wasn't too loud and the food came pretty quickly. The ordering off of a paper menu was really old school but brought back good memories. The servers were okay. Less interaction, didn't clear our empty plates as quickly. Would I come here again? I don't know. I just think for the same price, I'd get better quality of food and great service at Cynthias but if I wanted a less crowded intimate setting, I would definitely come here. Happy Eating fellow Yelpers!",positive
"I did not understand how the service was so slow that we were the one of the first few families there before it got crowded and we were the third last family there that night, not by choice or binge. We ordered and waited 30 minutes before our actual first round came. We had a mind to order wasabi while waiting otherwise it would have been so much longer wait before taking our first bite. I will say that the food was good. Just that I saw they repeatedly served other tables but forgot about ours. I do say ""forgot"" because a few of our orders were missing right until our second and last order. No way we wanted to wait and we couldn't anyways because it was almost 8:45PM!!! We came in right at 6:25PM. When I asked about our last order of sushi roll, the server said ""I just checked and your is coming right up"". Hmm, right because we are almost the only ones left now. Thank you for giving your attention to our food after everyone else's. In sum, try not to sit in a booth farthest from the chefs. They might forget you too. I heard a family who sat just one table closer to the chef counter asking about their order status, they left earlier ... came later than us. Hmmm. You know, it got crowded after we ordered our first round but how is it that those people came in and out already? Anyways, thank you for the food but I would not like to wait every 30 minutes for the next order to come.",negative
"Taka - the only sushi restaurant in Newmarket that can routinely treat me like I'm an inconvenience and keep me coming back for more. I don't know what it is about this place either than simply the food is good. Okay, we're not talking about a 5 star sushi house here, but for local sushi? This places hits the spot. The sushi is fresh, the appetizers are delicious, the less conventional items (Thai curry) are perfection, and they have deep fried ice cream and custard buns. (Which they have a 2 servings per person limitation on ... which is a good thing, cause I could easily down 6 of each of these by myself - no shame.) My boyfriend and I have a running joke that I should ask for a bowl of rice at the same time I put in my beverage order, with any luck, maybe I'll get it by the time we order dessert. Which brings me to my final point, and only qualm: the service. Good luck getting anyone's attention, you will ask for the same thing several times, and if you're lucky, maybe just maaaaaybe, they'll bring it to you.",positive
"I'm a regular to this place, probably been here at least 40 times since moving to Newmarket cause i live a 3 minute walk away. There used to be 3 female servers when I started going here that gave exceptional service, were kind, attending to my needs, and appreciating that I came here often and acknowledged that. This was my go to for sushi due to quality of food, service and convenient location. Back then, I wouldve given 5 stars. But my experience with this place today with the new two female staff members has changed my views. I came in for the lunch AYCE with two people. The place was pretty busy so I saw past the horrible service for a while and was patient with my food and water. Nearing the end of my meal, I had one more order to put in and the lady server looked directly at me with the paper i was holding, gave me a rolling eyed look, and walked away. She then went up to the other female server and started talking in their language with a rude tone, while looking my direction and pointing towards me. They were both clearly very irritated or angry with my table or something but we were never rude to them the whole lunch. When they finally came for my last order after about 30 minutes, the dessert took another 20 minutes and when I asked if it was coming, the lady gave me a rude ""the order's put in already!!"" Because of their two new female staff members, I will go find a new place regardless of this place being so close to where i live. I miss their old staff and wish their new staff wasnt horrible because the manager is an awesome guy.",negative
"This place has gone way downhill since our last visit in 2016. Service was terrible. When we walked in the waitress pointed at a table and then ignored us for 10 minutes even though the place was empty. There is virtually no communication from wait staff. They take your order paper then come by and toss dishes at you as they are walking past. Timing in between dishes was poor. After waiting a long time, I asked about another dish I'd ordered. Well, another ten minutes after that, the waitress comes by and slams the dish down on our table. It felt like dining in North Korea. The restaurant is looking run-down too, floors dirty, shabby. Not worth $23.95 per person! We will never go back there.",negative
I get take out from here at least twice for the past 8 months! I can't Believe I haven't reviewed them yet every single time the food is so fresh and so good and the prices are so reasonable!! I made a mistake of going somewhere that was closer to my house recently the price was double and the quality was not half as good as Taka sushi!! Keep up the great work guys!!!,positive
"This place is definatly mine and my boyfriends favourite spot for sushi in newmarket. The food always looks delicious and tastes fresh! We have found the price is great too, it seems to be a little lower than some of the other spots in the area. The loyalty card is a great idea too, definatly makes us returning customers!",positive
"Oh let me start by saying. Sushi Itto in aurora way better than this place for food!! That's number one. Unfortunately, I had a sushi craving today and sushi Itto isn't open on Sundays. So I ventured out to this place. My family and I use to come here every other weekend but we got a little ticked off by the service just rude in general so we decided to stop coming hence how we found sushi Itto. I decided to come here anyways try it out again. The food isn't bad, nothing to write home about but that wouldn't make me give it a one star. What does deserve a one star is Pompous ass that was serving us. He had the nerve to come to me and said we were wasting food! Never have I ever had someone say this to me because I NEVER waste. There was one time at masa in Toronto where I couldn't finish and went to the cash and offered to pay to bring the food home. Thy charged me $8 and I was happy to pay and tipped VERY well on that. Anyways, this horrible waiter said he took many plates with food, not sure if he's old or just blind or mixing up tables because all my plates were done. So sorry I didn't know I had to eat every bean sprout on the plate and the shrimp tail for you to believe that it's done. The only thing I returned was their general Tao chicken which was literally sweet deep fried soggy bread with no hints of recognizable chicken. So after he comes to tell me this, I am pissed beyond belief and can't finish my meal, I get up to the cash ask him to come see me when he's done serving his tray. I tell him to bill me whatever he wants but I'm never coming back. Where he says ""whatever"". Good way to keep your customers!!! He charge me $5 and an extra $1 on each persons meal. Think I didn't catch that, please.... Revenge is a dish best served cold and here's mine!!! Bill come to $41 and I don't tip. Anyone want to venture why??? Anyways I will keep to my promise, I will never come back. And just an FYI take a look at all the places I've given 1* to in the past.... They haven't stayed in business long. I know my stuff guys, customer service is the most important and I've never had such bad treatment in my life at any sushi restaurant, it was utterly disrespectful.",negative
"Great experience for the price you pay I have been here for years and have been to lunch and dinner. The lunch Is my fave just because I am not a huge fan of the extra dinner options. The quality of fish is not the best, but for the price you pay it's to be expected. Drinks are free refills, which is nice. The beef is amazing! We chow down on a huge plate every time. The crunchy rolls (shrimp,mayo,crispy) are an excellent beginner roll. Our fave now is their new ice and fire roll ( crab,cream cheese, deep fried). The tempura is always light and fluffy. Sashimi is a dinner only option, but They offer sushi during lunch though. They now have a loyalty card so I think after 10 visits you get the next one free. Overall a nice experience. They have changed management over the years but have kept up with the competition of other sushi shops.",positive
"Usually very good.... Service is fast! Staff is very friendly, they always interact with the kids. The best all you can eat sushi place around here.",positive
"This was my first all you can eat sushi experience and I wasn't sure quite what to expect. I was assuming there was going to be a lesser quality product for the $20 per person price tag, but I was pleasantly surprised! The tempura was awesome, the fish was fresh, and the presentation was very pleasing. Everything you could possibly ask for when you have a sushi craving! My only complaint is that our waitress obviously did not want to be there, barely saying 3 words to us the entire time we were there, but thats being said, service was prompt. Overall I would highly recommend this place!",positive
"This used to be our 'go to' place in newmarket for All You Can Eat japanese food, since there aren't that many in the area. Their food is average. The last time we went, and that will be our very last time, we had left over 4 pieces of maki roll and perhaps 3 pieces of chicken cutlet. The waitress came over and said, ""you have to eat everything!"". I was quite offended and being regular customers there, I knew the waitress was new. Anyhow, she was quite rude and said she was going to charge us for every piece that we didn't eat. I think she was mistaken that she was paying us to have a meal there. Anyhow, the experience has left such a bad taste in our mouths that we will never go back there. HOW RUDE!",negative
The fries were good. After speaking with the chefs here. I have decided to update my first review. A big fan. However there were about 10 of us at the truck but it took 20 minutes for fries. Everyone was waiting and getting really irritated. If you get the wait time under 10 minutes. I would def give it a 5 star,positive
"This was my first time trying Tango Food Truck. We ordered several items...the steak bowl, choripan sandwich, spinach empanada, and fries. The steak in the steak bowl was seasoned so well. The best meat I have had outside of Gaucho in Pittsburgh. It came with spinach and grilled vegetables which were also delicious. I had a bite of my husbands choripan sandwich. It had a very different but good taste to it. The food took longer than I expected to be ready being a food truck, but once I took my first bite of that steak I realized it was well worth the wait. There is no doubt I will be returning to this truck.",positive
Today I realized I never write about food trucks! What kind of jerk am I that I constantly praise the amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh but fail to acknowledge the deliciously talented trucks we have! Tango is amazing and unique in Pittsburgh. Their empanadas are flavorful and the sauce that comes with them is also exceptional. They have an amazing steak sandwich that if also delicious and fresh! I have also seen theses fries that have chicken and cheese on them... I only let myself drool at them for a second or two before I head to the bathroom to stare in the mirror and talk myself out of it. Excellent food!,positive
"Best food truck in Pittsburgh, all the food is authentic and tastes great. The empanadas and sausage are my personal favorite but the other foods are good too",positive
Food was excellent and well seasoned. I ordered the steak bowl and loved every bite! Steak was tender and had an amazing sauce on top. Will definitely order again.,positive
"Tango has Authentic Argentinian food. The menu includes Steak Sandwich, Milanesa, empanadas Beef Kabob, Chorizo & salad. Had the Choripan sausage sandwich with chimichurri, onions and peppers. It came with a side of rice. Great sandwich. Check them out on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tangofoodtruck/",positive
"Der Chef ist nett, macht aber auch den Eindruck ein Wichtigtuer zu sein (wedeln mit dem Porsche Schlüssel). Alles kein Problem, denn er war sehr nett und hat sich kurz mit ins unterhalten. Das Essen war unterdurchschnittlich. Wir fanden es für Stader Verhältnisse allerdings sehr teuer. Ansonsten nettes Ambiente. Erstaunt waren wir als der Koch nach seiner Raucherpause (ääähhh ja lecker) mit einer gefüllten Kaufland Tüte ins Restaurant ging Passte zum Essen welches nach Tiefkühlkost von der Kaufland Billig-Hausmarke K-Klassik schmeckte und aussah. Wo die teilweise guten Bewertungen herkommen kann ich mir auch nicht erklären. Das können nur typische Freundschaftsdienste sein. Fazit: Erstmal nicht wieder, da Qualität und Preis nicht im Ansatz zusammen passen.",negative
"Echte Tapas sind das nicht, es ist viel aus der Truhe dabei. Es schmeckt trotzdem gut und das Allyoucaneat ist nett und gut besucht. Ein schöner Ort im Sommer, wenn man draussen sitzen kann, da kommt es einem wie am Mittelmeer vor.",negative
"Kleines, aber feines Restaurant in Fachwerkhaus am alten Hafen. Moderne Einrichtung. Wir wurden freundlich empfangen und bekamen -ohne Reservierung- grade noch einen (recht kleinen) Tisch. Die Speisekarte bietet für jeden Geschmack etwas, Sonderwünsche wurden berücksichtigt. Das Essen kam nach kurzer Wartezeit, war lecker angerichtet und schmackhaft. Uns hat es so gut geschmeckt, dass wir am nächsten Urlaubstag nochmal dort eingekehrt sind.",positive
"Das sind keine Tapas! Ein Sammelsurium von deutschen Tiefkühlprodukten mit riechlich Möhren. Einzig spanisch war der Chorizo und Manchego. Ich habe auch in Deutschland sehr gute Tapas bekommen, aber dieses Essen war sehr enttäuschend, zudem sind die Preise völlig überzogen. Das ist nicht Spanisch! Ach ja, das Ambiente ist nett. PS: Ich wundere mich über die Bewertungen, das kann gar nicht sein bei dem Essen!",negative
"Froi froi bald is der Sommer da und es geht wieder los entspannt am Wasser/Fischmarkt sitzen dabei lecker Wein und Tapas genießen. Wer braucht schon SpanAnien ? hab doch alles hier! Was ich besonders empfehlen kann, ist das Tapasbuffet am Sonntag abend. Komplette Karte rauf und runter plus richtige Sattmacher ohne Limit. Ich platze quasi jedesmal aus allen Nähten danach. Und diese herrliche Schwere nach 2 Glas Rotem dazu Schwelg also Sonne gib Gas, ich will da wieder hin. my2cents S.",positive
Wir waren sehr enttäusch eine Spannische Tapas-Restaurant haben wir uns anders vorgestellt. Die Speisekarte ist übersichtlich die Preise sind heftig vom nehmen ist noch keiner arm geworden. Portion klein mm sehr klein stehen in keinen Preis Leistungsverhältnis. Dort draußen zu sitzen ist sehr schön was trinken dort ja essen nein danke. Personal sehr aufmerksam freundlich einfach super. Die WC-Anlage ist einfach zu klein. Ein Herrenbecken echt super!!,negative
"Wir waren sehr enttäuscht und hatten uns ein typisches spanisches Restaurant irgendwie anders vorgestellt. Wie hier schon jemand schrieb war das Essen alles andere als lecker und bestand zum Großteil aus Fertigprodukten. Das Ambiente ist ja ganz nett, aber sonst",negative
"Das TAPAO ist wunderschön gelegen mitten am alten Fischmarkt von Stade. Man sitzt entweder bei gutem Wetter draußen direkt am Wasser oder im gemütlichen Ambiente im Restaurant. Das Tapao versprüht eine angenehme Atmosphäre, durch die Fenster hat man einen schönen Ausblick auf den alten Hafen. Wir sind vor 2 Jahren von Hamburg nach Stade gezogen und ich kann als Fan der spanischen Küche sagen, dass das Tapao kulinarisch durchaus mithält mit ""den"" spanischen Restaurants Hamburgs wie das ""Altamira"" oder ""Barcelona"". Hut ab! Besonders schön ist das sonntägliche Tappa-Buffet zu adäquaten Preisen. Auch die Weinkarten ist sehr gut! Wir haben im Tapao mit Freunden und Familie unvergessliche Stunden verbracht! Der Service war stets freundlich, flott und aufmerksam. Auch Sonderwünsche werden berücksichtigt. Wir sind so begeistert vom Tapao, dass wir anlässlich unserer Hochzeit am 9. Dezember 2011 den Inhaber Phil fragten, ob er uns für unserere Hochzeitsfeier mit 100 Gästen ein schönes Tappa-Buffet zaubern könne. DAS HAT ER! Das Essen war hervorragend und überzeugte auch Gäste, die bis dato die spanische Küche nicht kannten. Das Personal und der Service war einfach super! Ein tolles, abgestimmtes und eingespieltes Team. Phil, der Inhaber vom TAPAO, hat es sich nicht nehmen lassen, unsere Feier vor Ort persönlich mit seinem Personal zu begleiten. Unsere Feier war einfach toll - wir und unsere Gäste waren allesamt begeistert! Dazu hat Phil zu einem sehr großen Teil beigetragen durch seine tollen Speisen und Getränke, sein Engagement, mitreißende Begeisterung und Esprit gepaart mit einer guten Portion guter Laune. Vielen Dank nochmals!!! Wir empfehlen das TAPAO ausdrücklich mit gutem Gewissen weiter für einen Restaurantbesuch oder als Caterer und Partyservice für private Feiern oder Events. Wir wünschen Phil (Heiko Filsack) und seinem Team alles Gute für das Jahr 2012 und weiterhin eine genussvolle und erfolgreiche Zukunft! K & M",positive
hallo ich bin toro ich bin gestern auch hier im tapao mit meinen freunden tapas essen gewesen und dann lese ich so etwas als kritik dann werde ich auch mal was dazu schreiben wir haben ein 3er tapasteller und zwei fischteller sowie wein und wasser bestellt als wein haben wir einen MACIA BATLE und eine PROTOS VERDEJO zu uns genommen das essen war toll angerichtet und auch für mich vielfrass ausreichend es wurde aioli und brot immer nachgereicht und noch nicht mal berechnet ich finde das der koch kreativ ist und manche kritik nicht in ordnung ist wenn man schreibt das der wein einfach ok ist muss ich dem wieddersprechen derjenige sollte sich mal den feinschmecker anschauen da sind top bewertungen zur sauberkeit kann ich nur sagen das alles in ordnung war ich denke das jemand der so eine schlechte kritik schreibt nur neidisch ist wir kommen wider der laden ist toll und hat am abend das beste romantische Ambiente gruß der toro und seine freunde es gibt ein alltes sprichwort wo erfolg ist !!!! da ist auch der neid!!!!,positive
"Fuer ein span. Rest. Haette man sehr viel mehr erwarten koennen. Die sog.

TK Garnelenspiesse, nicht mal gegart. Polo: Einfachste Huehnerstuecke ohne Geschmack Kartoffeln mit Merrsalz: haben die nie gesehen! Salat: nichts sagend Wein: ok Bedienung: alleine ueberfordert. Weshalb arbeiten hier nicht mehr Kollegen. Alles in allem: Ein Stader Gastro-Problem. Keine Fantasie, nur conv. Food Schade! N18CL",negative
"Sehr nette und freundliche Bedienung. Das Essen war OK, Preise waren auch OK, aber ich würde eher OK- sagen. Das Lokal ist einfach sehr schön. Im Sommer ist es herrlich, draußen zu sitzen mit Blick auf den alten Hafen. Alles hatte mir geschmeckt und mussste nicht lange warten. Sehr schöne Bar, um sich mit Freunden zu treffen und sich von Geschichte zu umhüllen.",positive
"Wir waren zum Klasse Büfett am Sonntag Abend da. Es ist ein tolles Büfett mit kalten und warmen Speisen. Es wird ständig nachgelegt, der Wein dazu ist passend. Die Bedienung ist sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. Der Wirt ist ein klasse Gastgeber. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Im Winter ist es gut, zu reservieren. Am Montag sollte man die Zähne sehr gut putzen.",positive
"Wir haben das Tapao am 19.04.11 besucht. Kleine nette Bar mit der Möglichkeit, draußen zu sitzen. Tapas sind sehr gut. Beim Preis / Leistungsverhältnis kenne ich andere Bars / Restaurants, wo das Verhältnis noch einen Schwung besser ist. Daher in diesem Bereich besser jedoch nicht Top. Einzig die Musik wollte uns nicht in der Richtung passen. Etwas Latino würde schon gut tun.",positive
"In der wunderschönen Stader Altstadt direkt am alten Hafen gelegen, kann man hier im Sommer großartig vor dem Lokal sitzen und die tolle Atmosphäre der Stadt und das bunte Treiben ""rund ums Wasser"" genießen, ohne störenden Straßenlärm, denn die Zone um den Hafen ist verkehrsberuhigt. Aber auch der Gastraum ist sehr ansprechend. Es gíbt eine tolle Auswahl an Weinen und Speisen, besonders zu empfehlen ist aber das sonntägliche Tapas-Büffet: eine wirkliche große Tapas-Auswahl von guter Qualität und die einzelnen Platten/Schüsseln werden STÄNDIG wieder nachgefüllt, es gibt auch bei den begehrteren Leckereien keine Engpässe. Super Service von sehr freundlichen Gastgebern :-)",positive
"Im Tapao war ich erst einmal und hab leider auch nichts gegessen, daher dreht sich dieser Beitrag um den Service und das Ambiente. Wir waren Abends auf der Suche nach einem gemütlicher Location in der man einen guten Wein bekommen kann. Das ist in diesem, direkt am Fischmarkt gelegenen, Restaurant auf jeden Fall möglich. Im Sommer ist die Straße mit Tischen besetzt und man sitzt gemütlich draußen mit Blick über den Kanal und Marktplatz. Da es sich in einem alten Fachwerkhaus befindet ist es auch innen entsprechend eingerichtet. Schlicht, gemütlich aber nicht altbacken und kitschig. Man sitzt relativ eng beieinander an teilweise alten Nähmaschinentischen. Die Weinkarte ist groß und man findet sicher den richtigen Tropfen zu einem ordentlichen Preis. Über die Bedienung kann ich mich ebenfalls nicht beklagen. Sie kam zügig, war freundlich und konnte uns perfekt über die angebotenen Weine aufklären und eine Empfehlung aussprechen die übrigens hervorragend geschmeckt hatte. Ich werde sicher noch mal kommen, da die Gerichte an den Nachbartischen groß waren und gut aussahen. Ich berichte, ob es geschmeckt hat.",positive
Direkt am alten Hafen ein gemütliches kleines spanisches Restaurant mit netter Chefin und zwei interessanten Aktionen: mittwochs Paella satt (Vorsicht: Platzgefahr!) und sonntags Tapas-Buffet all-u-can-eat. Beides günstig und gut.,positive
"You're in luck if you want some authentic northern, western Chinese food!!! 1) food: I highly recommend the cold noodles (y'all know what I'm talking about! See photo). There's not many places that can make them as authentically as this place. The spice and the salt is just right. The lamb skewers were also pretty great (told by my parents). My family also loved the beef brisket soup. And I personally loved the eggplant dish (best I've had) and the long beans!! But again: get the cold noodles. 2) the atmosphere. Right when you walk in you're welcome by the smell of SPICE! And immediately your salivary glands are getting into action and your body's telling you, you're ready to eat! There's also plenty of space, not super crowded, large tables so it'll be good for large parties too. 3) location: very conveniently located at a major intersection in Scarborough. If you're in the area, definitely worth the drop by. BONUS TIPS: they have a membership I believe it's $20 for 2 years and essentially you get 50-60% off on each dish!! It's super worth it, we got it on our first visit and we amount we spent on the membership was already saved in the first meal. So make sure you ask for it at the beginning! (Membership is cash only though)",positive
"Great price for pretty authentic Chinese food. Western Chinese cuisines can be pretty spicy, and the default is usually spicy. Make sure you ask for non spicy if you cannot handle the heat. The BBQ fish was really juicy and delicious. I also really like the noodles and dumplings here.",positive
"I love the food here, and found the servers to be very friendly too - more so than your average Asian place that's for sure. It's has a spacious feel inside, good for accommodating groups (they have several large round tables). BBQ lamb kebabs are a must-order here; you can specify how many you want to be spicy/non-spicy. I tend to order kebabs in separate batches throughout the meal so that I can eat them while they're warm. I also like their stir-fry hand pulled noodle dish with veggies and choice of meat (I always get lamb), and today we also decided to get the Xinjiang style bun with lamb meat and rolled green onion with beef. Each dish's flavour was so, so on point. I don't think I managed to take a single picture prior to digging in today, because the food was just that tempting to me. Be warned that some dishes are pretty greasy (on par with most Chinese restaurants), but they were worth every bite. Heavily considering getting one of their VIP memberships to save a bit of $$ on their prices; we don't come here very often because it's out of the way, but when we do, we tend to order a lot at once...",positive
"We had the lamb skewer, boiling fish here. It is alright. I have had Lamb skewers elsewhere in Toronto, the pieces wasn't very consistently fatty but the flavor is good, not too salty. The fish was also very mediocre. For uptown tho I would come back for the lamb skewer, but not for boiling fish!",negative
"Sometimes I forgot to read my own review. I should have know not to order any noodle again at Taste of Western China. Sour and Spicy Noodle ($8.49) was just down right BAD! It is worse than the instant package (just add hot water version) from grocery store. The beans were stale and the taste of soup base did not have the right combination of sour and spicy aside from that layer of hot oil floating on top. The monthly special Beef in chili oil (Reg $6.99, Special $1.99 if you like them on Wechat?) was not too good either. I would not be happy to have pay $7 for that and even at $2?? The BBQ Cabbage ($4.49) still our favourite!! Maybe I should just order one per person and nothing else?",negative
"My favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto! And it's the restaurant that I dine in most frequently, even more frequently than fast food. BBQ items are all highly recommended! The lamb kebab is probably the best that I've ever had in Canada. The only thing can compare is the one that I actually ate in Western China, Xinjiang province. The hand pulled noodles are cooked in a traditional manner and it tastes just like the ones that I had in China. And there're so many dishes for you to choose. No matter what we chose, it's just like a surprise and it's so good. Absolutely 5 star",positive
"The best hand pulled noodles! The spices! The lamb! The dumplings! This place is so good! My boyfriend brings home an array of food from here any time he goes to Kelly Spa. Last time, yesterday I was home sick with a throat infection. Whenever I am sick I crave hot and sour soup. Though they don't serve hot and sour soup, they were kind enough to make it for us! And wow. They should put it on their menu. It's hot, but has so much depth. The wood ear, the carrots, everything is perfectly cooked. This is quickly become our recommendation to anyone in the area!",positive
"My family has been to this place many times and we really enjoyed it each time. The prices are amazing (especially if you have the membership card) and the portions are filling. Our favorites include the drunk chicken, the beef hand pulled noodles and the spicy apps. The servers here are friendly as well! Theres plenty of space to sit if you plan on bringing a larger party.",positive
"This place was perfect to conclude the end of a day trip to Toronto with my dad. My dad and I both got the bone-in chicken roti, and if we didn't know we were in Toronto, we'd have thought we were in Trinidad. It could have only been better if they had sorrel, but it's certainly not worth bringing them down a star for that! If I ever am back in Toronto, I'll probably try their fry bakes, and maybe move on from there, time and appetite permitting. (Yelp in Toronto is hard to navigate - conflicting reviews dominate all the top restaurants without a filter on, to the point where I spent an hour browsing for a place that didn't say both ""this is way better than x place down the street, the food is perfectly seasoned"" and ""better eat at x place down the street, this place has the worst seasoning on the food"". Blech. I had to turn on the ""cheap"" filter on Yelp to find this place. All the ratings in this category seem more genuine. Are expensive restaurants gaming Yelp in Toronto?)",positive
"I love Tasty's. My mom loves it too.. specially their jerk chicken!! Every year when she visits me during the summer, she makes sure we have a meal there!! This time I could take my dad to Tasty's too.. N they just got a new fan :D Stay awesome as always :)",positive
"After arriving in Toronto, we headed directly to Tasty's Caribbean Restaurant. The jerk chicken plate is delicious, generous, and served with rice, beans and cole slaw. The wait staff is friendly and are always helpful and the new location was easy to find. A must for authentic Caribbean food. We can't wait to return!",positive
"Tastys carribean is hidden in the middle of Spadina, surrounded by lots of chinese restaurants. This place is so incredibly delicious. The cook there definitely knows what they're doing. Everything is perfectly seasoned and well cooked. Best carribean food I've ever had!",positive
"I would go here again and again if I lived in Toronto. Good prices, and $7 daily lunch specials. Ask about it before you order a $12 dish because the lunch special is filling and you can miss it if you don't inquire or see the sign! I went with the jerk chicken --although moist and flavorful, I would opt for a curry next time because I like sauced up food.",positive
"One of my favourite lunch joints in the city. Affordable, tasty and filling! It's 20 mins from my work and I still try to make the trek whenever I'm craving Jamaican food for lunch. There are Ritz's closer to me but I have enough sense to not waste my money on that.",positive
"Been here at least 3 times and (I think) went at least once before they changed locations. I've also never had jerk chicken before coming to Toronto that I know of, but after eating at least three different jerk chicken, I have to say that this place is one of, if not the definitive, best places to get jerk chicken. Their jerk chicken practically falls off the bones and is seasoned very well. They also have a great location for UofT students and pretty good prices. Their jerk chicken special (a small cubular box) is about $6, if I remember correctly, $9 for a regular box that's about twice the size of a special, and $11 for the large, which is maybe 80% larger than a regular (I'm just eyeballing the sizes). I didn't include the tax, so just multiply everything by 1.13 for the final price. 10/10 would recommend. Unless you're not a fan of picking out bones, but I mean, it's a chicken. They have a deboned version of their jerk chicken for I think a dollar extra though, so you can do that if you want. I haven't tried it since a few years back, so iunno how many of these tiny bones they can actually remove.",positive
"Went in for a quick and cheap lunch, ordered the veggie meal which consisted of a large portion of rice, channa, and vegetables. Everything tasted amazing at the first bite, and surprisingly so. Even the vegetables had a strangely alluring taste, which I was happy about. Not long after, however, I got very thirsty, so I suspect the use of MSG which is disappointing. Pretty good bang for your buck but I don't know if I'll be back.",negative
"Good stuff. 10/10 would come again Meat was tender and filling and they had a good selection of sauces. Good price, good eats, and left pretty satisfied.",positive
"Best lunch deal in the U of T area ($5.99 for 1/4 chicken, rice and veggies). Jerk chicken is spiced just right and the coleslaw is amazing. Great lunch spot with fast service. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!",positive
"I'm a little conflicted writing this review. I enjoyed my meal, but I found quite a bit of room for slight improvements that would've made things far better. I opted for the boneless goat roti, jerk chicken quarter, portion of chana and their in-house pepper sauce. This chicken was delicious, with a nice smokiness and a pleasantly spicy seasoning. Skin was a little soggy and didn't have the char or crispiness I really look for in a good jerk chicken. What I was really looking forward to was the roti and channa. The roti shell was light, flaky and delicious. The dhalpuri was super aromatic and complimented the curry goat perfectly. My only quam was the goat was quite gristly. I find the best curries usually have tender meat that falls apart from the extended cooking, but this just fell a little short for me. I was also disappointed the chana was a little soupy and lacked the intense flavours I was hoping for. One thing you can't miss is their pepper sauce though. I wouldn't completely dismiss Tasty's, but definitely didn't blow my socks off.",negative
Had the jerk chicken special and it was good. Meat fell off the bone. They prepare it for 24 hours so lots of love out in. Had the medium sauce for a bit of a chilli kick.,positive
MY TO-GO PLACE FOR CARIBBEAN OR ANY LUNCH DATE. The chicken is always really delicious - super moist and the jerk seasoning is spot on. I also love their hot sauces. The only weird thing about this place is the staff - really hit or miss. But DELICIOUS food. Their third location just recently opened and I'm super happy about that because this place is just super TASTY.,positive
"This place saved me when my food plan ran out last year. Do not let the pictures of the 5.99 meal deceive you, it is a very generous portion. I always get jerk chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw. They have always been good but I swear the food is even better after the move. The meat just falls off the bone. Also, the people on cash are always super friendly. Best food for your dollar on campus! Edit: I am vegetarian now so I order the channa option. It is hard to find affordable, filling, and delicious vegan food, but the channa lunch special hits all the marks!",positive
"Always wanted to try this place and today we did. Not too impressed with what we got. We got the boneless chicken large which was $12 plus taxes. This is the first time I've ordered jerk chicken, other times it's just been there and I ate it. So the difference between the boneless and the regular jerk chicken is they debone it. It's still dark meat, which in hindsight I should have gone with the regular since it was cheaper. Cause there was bone when we ate it. My main complaint is the sauce the lady put on it. I guess most people, the sauce is the most important part but for us I found it too sweet and spicy. It was difficult to eat because I try to cut down sugar so the fact that the chicken was sweet and the sauce overpowered things I wasn't a fan. Next time, I'll get the sauce on the side and try the chicken leg or roti.",negative
"Been here a few times, and I always come back because the food here is a great example of homestyle comfort food. -Price is very reasonable, you can get a lunch for $5.99 wich includes the jerk chicken, a coleslaw and rice. The flavours are very delicious and spicy, but you can also get non-spicy. -I tried doubles here for the first time, and loved them -Beef patties are also very tasty (no pun intended) -Everything seems to be done with care -The atmosphere is small, so if you're coming as a big group, you may not all fit. I usually just get takeout from here -Decor is really simple, not much going on with it. -Staff are friendly -Quick service -Great place for a quick lunch or dinner, or takeout at a great price, which is why I always come back here",positive
"This place had my favorite Caribbean food ever! Love the doubles here which are only for $2.50 each, but you get them only on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I did not get them one Wednesday when I went there before 1:00 pm. I love their lunch specials and as a vegetarian I love their Chana, rice and beans, steamed vegetables and Cole slaw. My son loves their Jerk Chicken! Love this place and crave their food quite a bit!",positive
We had the jerk chicken and bbq chicken special over rice and peas. Every component of that dish was bursting with flavour and blended so well. Both of our chicken dishes brought back memories of the dishes we had in Turks and Caicos. I mistakenly assumed that the chicken would be laid over a bed of plain rice but boy was I wrong. The rice was bursting with just as much flavour as the chicken! Definitely will be back here again and I'm curious to try the roti next time!,positive
"$5.99 lunch special is probably unbeatable for the nearby university area. You can choose a meat (bbq chicken, jerk chicken, beef, etc.), either rice or rice and peas and salad/coleslaw. Very quick service (5 minutes at most). Only thing is that their ""salad"" is quite sad, with a few pieces of lettuce, cucumber and carrots; so, don't have high expectations for that. Their normal prices are still very reasonable at around $10 for a regular meal, which comes in the larger take-out containers. Staff are super friendly!",positive
"5.99 lunch special. I got - fried chicken, bbq rice & veg Mom got- jerk chicken, rice& peas, coleslaw Moms first time having jerk chicken and I'm glad it was here!!!! Authentic && delicious.",positive
"Tasty's is a no-nonsense Caribbean takeout spot on College that I can see has many fans of its homestyle cooking. Don't expect table service as this is a styrofoam takeout container type of fast food joint, but with a homey family run atmosphere. I ordered the bone-in chicken roti and it was fabulous! The wrap was gooey-oooey chewy delicious and the chicken inside was tasty too. Nice warm curry with some typical Carib hot sauce to spice it up just right. The portion was generous as you would expect for the price offering excellent value. Great spot to know about in the area as an alternative to typical fast food or pub grub.",positive
"Came here for their lunch special - chose rice and peas (actually beans), jerk chicken, and coleslaw. The price of this was apparently raised at the beginning of the year to 5.99+ tax (total 6.77). The three pieces of chicken was flavorful and super tender - I cut the meat off the bone with a plastic spoon! The rice was spicy, soft, and filling - I believe they match the rice and meat spice level, so that a mild chicken would be paired with a mild rice. All the food comes in one container though, so my slaw picked up some spice. Overall, solid value and good food surprisingly close to UofT, definitely worth coming back.",positive
"Very nice foods& lunch special & great portion !! And the staffs are friendly always. Unlike those chinatown restaurants, they are welcoming customers. Foods are little too salty however great foods ! :)",positive
"I have been coming here almost daily for the past few weeks. The food is amazingly good- it is absolutely delicious and well... Tasty! Their special is an awesome deal- salad, chicken and rice for $6. I have tried both their curry and jerk chicken and they are savoury. What makes this place stand out (thus 5* rating) is the pleasant and humourous staff at the counter. With great food along with a great working crew- this is my ""go to"" neighbourhood fave!",positive
"Walked over from College Station, looking for a quite bite to eat and Caribbean sounded good. I had the lunch special (jerk chicken, rice and peas, veg) while my fiance had the boneless chicken roti. Both very delicious, the name of the restaurant is very fitting. I usually don't like jerk chicken because even though the spices are good, the chicken is normally dry. Not this place! The jerk chicken was moist, seasoned well, and the jerk seasonings were good with a bit of a kick. The rice and peas were cooked well, tasted like they added cinnamon which is a strange combination for me but overall, for $5.99 lunch special, a good and tasty deal. The boneless chicken curry roti was heavy, not wrapped well, but the flavours were delicious. The curry had strong Caribbean flavours, the potatoes, chickpeas and chicken were cooked well. Again, moist chicken. We were both stuffed, despite the lunch special not being a big portion. I'd say the roti was large though. A good lunch place. I'd definitely eat here again!",positive
"The food choices near the UofT campus is lacking to say the least, but boy is this place a diamond in the rough. This has been my go to place for lunch ever since I discovered it. The $5.00 (+Tax) lunch specials are godsend when you're on a student budget. The portion sizes aren't the largest, but the food is delicious, especially the jerk chicken. If I'm extra hungry, I splurge a little and get the roti, which only costs a few more dollars, and it has not yet disappointed. Little tip, if you can hold out til 3pm, they have a dinner special, which is the exact same thing as the lunch but a bit less than twice amount of food for only a dollar more. TL;DR cheap, delicious food near campus. What more can you ask for?",positive
"I'm a loyal fan of Ritz until I gave Tasty's a try due to its convenient location. I was not disappointed-- the lunch special is $4.99, and you get a decent amount of rice, chicken and coleslaw. The chicken is juicy and soft, and the jerk sauce is amazing! Cooked to perfection. I've been back for dinner special as well, and it does not disappoint. Fast service for quick take-outs. Will return soon!",positive
I love this place. It has really delicious food for great price. I've been going there everyday for the past year. I just can't find anywhere with better quality vs price balance than this place around UofT.,positive
Very friendly family-run roti place with a good community feeling. There is also an artisanal cupcake vendor sharing the space.,positive
"I had an amazing first-time experience here today. The lady working the cash was so sweet and pleasant, and when my friend and I tried to order something as separate entities, she very helpfully explained how we could order all the things we wanted as specials and thus save money. The place was busy and had a lively atmosphere, but we still got a table. It's a takeout place, so the atmosphere isn't gorgeous or anything, but it's a nice, sun-filled restaurant and a good vibe. The food was very tasty. The 'veg' component of the special was a bit disappointing (it was more like a cabbage salad), but the channa was delicious as was the chicken. The rice with gravy was done well, a classic Caribbean staple. Afterward, we got dessert at the little cupcake table in there, which was yummy! The prices were great at this place. Overall, it's a great, affordable place to grab a quick lunch or to chill for awhile. Also they do takeout, of course. I definitely recommend this place, and I will go back (as soon as I can!).",positive
"We used to go to Teakwoods all the time for lunch. However, their sub-par service is the reason why I never go there anymore. Dont get me wrong, their grilled hot wings are some of the best I have had. I just cant take an hour and a half for lunch. I would not write this review if this happened once or twice. They consistently deliver the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to. I dont think there has ever been a time at teakwoods where I got out of there in less than an hour. They seem to take forever for even the simplest of requests. If you have time to waste, go check out teakwoods. They are very good at making sure they waste as much as possible.",negative
"If you want bar food, this is the best place in town!!! Teakwoods was started by the owners of the ORIGINAL Long Wong's on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Long Wong's is long gone but the tradition continues- best wings in town, hands down. Every flavor, always fresh, try the suicide wings, I dare you! BOTTOM LINE: I drive accross town for wings. The fool I am.",positive
"We went here one night. I think the primary reason was to try the ""death"" wings. Its a pretty chill bar/restaurant. There are peanuts on the floor, it reminds me of North Woods Inn, in so. cal. Cheap drinks. BTW, they do not lie about the death wings.",positive
"Pros: Pro-Buckhunt and Ms. Pac-Man arcarde game, some moderately priced deep fried vegetarian options, huge plate of nachos, bud light chicks giving out free booze....um...tvs? Cons; The peanut thing to me is just gross. Why am I paying to eat in a barn? The tvs were weirdly placed, the food is still quickly made bar food and the ambiance is random mid-life crisis decor for that friends dad who is finally gonna ""party!"" and put up his favourite beer signs, some taxidermied animals. the ceiling fans with multi-colured lights-WTF? Could be bonus: If you have a mortal enemy allergic to peanuts, you could walk in the door and immediately shove their face into the peanut pit at the door-instant face swelling! And as they cry and fall to the floor-peanuts all over the floor stuck to their body! And....done.",negative
"I love Teakwoods. It's a very casual bar with cheap drinks, good food and a friendly wait staff. I'm a vegetarian, so I always get their veggie burger or the shrimp basket (what? I can eat shrimp here and there and still be a vegetarian). Both items are really good and I know my meat-eating friends really enjoy the burgers and sandwiches too. I think the bar staff is great- they're all really sarcastic (must be a prerequisite) and tend to remember your name after just a few times of hanging out there. There are baskets of peanuts by the door that patrons can grab as they walk in and you are supposed to throw the shells on the floor. It took me awhile to get used to this, and I can finally do it without feeling bad for the person that has to clean them up.",positive
Great food. Staff was very nice and attentive. Loved the big screen TVs so we could watch the golf tournament with lunch. Definitely recommend,positive
"Really thought this place was turning itself around until last night. I ordered a steak salad to be cooked medium and when it came out it was severely under done. Then to top it all off I pulled a hair out of my salad as well. I understand that things like this happen and hairs do fall out, but this isn't the first time this has happened here. Also, their soups used to be amazing, sadly not anymore )-:",negative
What a great place! I had a birthday get together at The Boulevard for my husband last weekend. The owners Mike and Megan were great to work with. They made sure that there was Karaoke for us and set up the dinning area for all of our guests. The food (pizza and wings) and drinks were great. All of the staff made sure that everyone was well taken care of. The karaoke DJ had a large selection of music and the regulars were a nice crowd. The fact that it's non smoking is a total bonus. We will definitely be returning.,positive
"I stopped in for lunch with my sister on a weekday. We each got a burger, and she ordered the mushroom soup. The food was excellent, and the server was very friendly!",positive
I barely got in the door. The sign said dining room open until 9:00. Bar until midnight. We arrived at 8:45. Yes it was late I know. The sign says you were still open! We were hungry we asked if we could sit in the dining room and were told no we thought we could sit in the bar and then were told that the kitchen was closed. Do you close at 8:45 or 9:00 or another time. Not a pleasant interaction.,negative
"Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. We ate at the bar, and bartender was attentive and friendly. As a Shaler resident, I can't believe I've been missing out on this neighborhood gem.",positive
Service is ok Waitress forgot my dinner rolls Potato pancakes nothing special They needed more onion and parsley Grated too fine also Should be courser Music is horrible,negative
"Great sandwiches/burgers and salads. Nothing fancy, just good food and friendly service. Portions are pretty huge- I haven't been able to finish a meal here yet!",positive
"This place is a great spot to grab a sandwich and a beer and also offer a good deal for their wing night. The service was extremely friendly and the food came out quickly. My wife and I split a turkey club, pulled pork nachos, and wings and everything was great. The turkey club was big with a ton of turkey and lettuce and tomato that came on it was very fresh. The nachos were also largely portioned and the bbq sauce they use is on the sweeter side which actually went well with the heat from the jalapeños and the saltiness of the chips. The wings were also good and a great deal at 40 cents a piece as it was wing night when we visited. We will definitely comeback to try some of their other sandwiches and burgers.",positive
"Great Burger! Great Bar! I met the new owner of Rice's Roadhouse. I sat on the left side (dining) where I had a really good burger after a 5 hour car ride. The burger was juicy. My Yuengling was cold. I paid my bill and adventured to the bar side. There was a nice lively crowd there. The bartender kept my Jameson full and its mate Yuengling. Price: $10 for dinner Atmosphere - Dining - clean, fun, friendly Bar - Fun, Friendly Service - Awesome on both sides You should check this place out.",positive
"Their brunch was decent, the eggs were good, white bread for toast was great, thick and tasty. Spinach omlete was greasy, bacon was nearly burnt, sausage pattie was pretty good except the patty itself was thin. In the end, 4 stars because even though the brunch food quality was a little below their standards, the overall price made it a great value.",positive
"This is our second time at this location and everything was great. Service was perfect, as was the food and drinks. This time we came on Friday evening and we were given a booth (no reservations during peak times) but there was plenty of seating available. We ordered from the classics menu and I added a lobster tail to my meal, it actually ended up coming with 2! Great deal. Steaks were cooked to perfection. There was too much food since they start you with warm bread and salads so we packed up our leftovers so we could have a bit of dessert. We chose the mini brownie (no nuts) and creme brûlée and they were prefect. For $3 each it was definitely wort it. I'm so glad this location is close by as we will continue to come for a great steak dinner.",positive
"I think I'm the only person who has never been to The Keg before (I've never been a big steak eater)...but I thought it was due time, so we went to The Keg - Yonge & Eglinton to celebrate my partner's birthday yesterday. I am usually really picky when celebrating special occasions and I have to say that this place exceeded all of my expectations. Reservation: No resos on weekends from 6-9ish, but that's okay because we wanted a late dinner anyway. We showed up at 9:15, and only had to wait a couple of minutes. Got a nice and spacious table. Food: So delicious that I only remembered to photograph our calamari appetizer. Woops. We ordered some sparkling water, wine, calamari, New York Striploin Keg Classic (x2) which came with salads, veggies (usually mushrooms but I hate mushrooms so they subbed it out for delicious asparagus and peppers), a side (I got the twice baked potato...it's MARVELLOUS! The star of the meal - get it!!! My partner got French fries and they were tasty too) and I added on lobster tails with butter for dipping. We finished with two cakes, cheesecake and the signature coffee ice cream cake. 50000 calories later and I was left smiling and satisfied. Service: A+ all around. From the hostesses, to the food runners and our server himself - everyone was kind and making jokes, happy to suggest items and eager to help make my partner's birthday very special. Perfect attentive service, in my opinion. Atmosphere: it's dark and spacious, romantic and classy - nothing to write home about, but it's great for dates, birthdays, whatever! Cost: the bill for two *including* tip was about $200ish. Considering we got fancy $6.50 water (lol), wine, appetizers, salad, steak, lobster, sides, etc. and all of it was simply delicious...I'd say that is a very reasonable price for a special occasion! Overall, I would definitely go back to this location and would be happy to suggest it to anyone going on a very nice date or celebrating a special moment.",positive
Have been to this Keg many times as it's walking distance. Almost never disappointed. Consistency in service (we usually sit in the lounge) and also in food. My husband takes a very blue steak and 8-9 times out of 10 they get it right. They're also always accommodating to our keto diet with substitutions if required. Have been to many other kegs and this is one of the best. Ask for John if you can - he's awesome! Definitely recommend!,positive
Love the keg. Always get the prime rib because it's so delicious and juicy. And the sauce that goes with it is absolutely amazing. Service is on point.,positive
My new favourite steakhouse. They really serve good food here- love their bread! We had a second round for it while waiting. Staff were nice and friendly. The place was nice and clean. Although your order will take some time but it was all worth it. I see people don't mind waiting so I guess this restaurant is a place to go.,positive
"What can i say? Another great Keg location. The servers and team here are exceptionally nice. Came here in a large group, and the service was extraordinary. It's strange getting service like that in a large group. The manager Michelle also came by a few times to check in on us, and she really made us feel special. Only downside is the parking situation.",positive
An update... I promptly emailed The Keg (as advised in their response here) and I also sent a copy to the email listed on their corporate website and have NOT received a response.,negative
"Even though it's a chain, one thing you can appreciate is that the quality of the food always remains at a standard and you know what to expect ! Consistency is always something we look for at repeat places to eat and that is what The keg is good for ! Keg is still the best moderate priced steak house, if you don't wish to spend over 120$ usually with this amount you'd get a good steak for two and an appetizer. Usually I order calamari, scallops wrapped with bacon, New York strip and the Prime rib roast ! The service is friendly, fast and attentive. If there is any issues like one time they ran out of specific cut of meat, the management goes above and beyond to still make your experience the best ! Make sure to reserve for the evenings or if you live close by, I suggest the take out isn't too bad either !",positive
"We came here for dinner in a large group. The service and atmosphere were great. I had the filet mignon with fries, which was delicious! The steak was tender, and the cheese on top matched it well.",positive
"Consistently good, as the Keg tends to be. Highlights: great lunchtime filet and side vegetables; great service that checked in with just the right frequency; bowls and bowls of those great chocolate mints scattered throughout the restaurant so that you can pocket a few extra ;) directly across from the south entrance/exit of the Eglinton TTC stop. Medium: parking available underground, but it was a bit expensive; side caesar wasn't served a lemon wedge. Low: opens exactly at 11:30 am, or shortly after, so if you arrive a bit early be prepared to wait outside and not in the lounge.",positive
"This is my family's go-to for milestone dinners. This past Saturday we were there for a birthday and the experience was fabulous, as always. Everyone was happy with their meals. I had the pistachio-crusted salmon with bacon brussels sprouts and garlic mashed potatoes. The server said the chef recommends ""medium"" which I went with. It was absolutely delicious.",positive
"I came back here a few days ago Let's just say, you come to a steak place for steak (which they do well), not for chicken. Anyways, the grilled chicken breast came extremely overcooked and tough and dry. As a Canadian, I was loathe to complain, but seriously, I should have.",negative
"Had dinner at this Keg last Saturday night. The steak (rib steak) that I ordered was likely the best I have ever had. The service was great, sat at the bar and was well taken care of by Chris. Great experience overall!",positive
"When you're in the mood to spend some money on good food and service. This is the place! Fresh ingredients, steaks cooked to your liking and perfection, friendly service all combined with a contemporary soothing decor.",positive
"We we were told we could sit anywhere so we sat in the lounge ready for drinks and a full dinner. Our server passed by us three times and didn't even say hello. I've worked in service and even if it wasn't my table to serve, I would always make sure guests were acknowledged so that they knew we weren't ignoring them and wouldn't leave. We felt ignored so we decided to leave. Will it kill you to just say, ""Hello. Someone will be right with you"" ??? What a disappointment. We were looking forward to splurging tonight. We ended up going to Fin Izakaya where they KNOW customer service is key. Had a great meal and time there.",negative
"The service was good, they were attentive. I went with work for our Christmas dinner, without a reservation it would be a 1.5 wait but luckly they had space in the lounge area. Had the baked brie and tuna tartare for starters and Filet Mignon as my main. The brie was good-can't really mess up baked brie and the tuna tartare was fresh and enjoyable. The steak however, was ok. I order medium-rare doneness and always emphasize that I like to see pink and blood. Had a previous amazing experience elsewhere and not sure if this raised my expectation but it was a lack-luster one here. The meat was tough for my likeness and had no desire to finish. My side (the twice baked potato) was also just alright. If I do go again(which probably won't be by my choice or at the same location) I will try something else and hope for the best.",negative
"Throughly disappointed. This was the second time in about 4 months. Similar to out previous visit, our prime rib was as tough as leather. The vegetables were undercooked, to the extent that they were still raw. Fortunately, the prime rib entrée was replaced with a better slab, but unlike the original order of medium rare, it came medium well. The veggies remained rare, but our replacement was missing the mushrooms. We could have complained yet again, but it would have been futile. Going forward, we shall not return to this location. I have given this locate a well deserved one-star and will visit others which I have had better luck.",negative
"We went here with a specific goal. To have a great steak, baked potato and a beer. The food did not disappoint. The steak was perfectly cooked for both of us and had the great flavour the keg steaks are known for. It did however disappoint in the server and service side. The restaurant wasn't busy but the service would have thought otherwise. We normally have a good time at this location but this one left something to be desired. Will return and give them another shot and hope it's just a one off.",positive
My first visit to the Keg & it's a nice treat. I organized a Thanksgiving dinner for a meetup group & it was a nice successful event.,positive
"Classic Keg experience for me, I have been going to Keg restuarants for years, the quality here is up to Keg standards. I used to live in the building above, and have spent the odd time here. If you haven't heard of the Keg, I highly reccomend it, great for a steak dinner for 2 under $100.",positive
"Second visit to The Keg Steakhouse Yonge/Eglinton after being unimpressed last time. This time - it's just slightly better. At least the steak was cooked right. I can't pin it as to why but even a good juicy piece such as the New York cut could turn out dry and somewhat bland while served lukewarm. The cook was about right which is medium rare with some redness inside. Still though - again, ingredient / seasoning of the steak was just off the mark. Definitely couldn't justify the price. On the upside - the place has great ambiance (perfect for event, etc) and service is also terrific. Unfortunately the food did not deliver.",negative
"Well, it's the keg, don't expect something extraordinary but do expect something good. It's a steakhouse chain, so it's on the expensive side, however not as expensive as the good steak house restaurants but I like it, it's convenient, the service can be pretty good or average it really depends who is serving you. The deco is nice, modern and fancy (not too fancy) you can go very casual, here you will find all types of costumers the snob and the ones wearing blue jays hats, so feel free to dress as you feel like, no one will judge. Alsooooo Free dessert on bdays :)",positive
"Went here a few months back with my girlfriend for dinner. The Atmosphere was very nice and calming even. Couldn't complain about the food either, it was good. The wait staff were kind and courteous and quick, no complaints there either. Reason this place is getting a bad rating ffom me is because it was really quite dirty. We were in a booth near the back, and my god there was so much crud and debris under our table we kept hitting and knocking with our feet. Seems like the cleaner missed a spot...Anyways it was gross, crumbs upon crumbs, and a dirty crusty straw. Hopefully they change cleaners or something, because I won't be going back until I hear that has been addressed. Still a nice place overall...Maybe just don't sit in the back area, seemed the most unkept. Cheers!",negative
"My wife and I enjoyed a beautiful steak dinner. The appetizer we loved baked goat cheese with perfectly toasted bread. Out Entree's we both ordered the Sirloins with the almond crust and goat cheese, they were both cooked to our taste perfectly. For our side we both enjoyed the twice baked potato which was hot and incredibly savory. We accompanied out meal with a glass of Baco Noir, a perfect companion. Out desert was an insanely great mocha ice cream desert on a chocolate crust with caramel and chocolate drizzle. It was called Miner something, please forgive me I don't recall exactly what it was called, but I'll never forget how much I enjoyed. Our server Mark was the golden touch to our meal. His professionalism, friendliness,and timing was impeccable . Well done Keg! We are so happy and impressed with your overall experience. Our date night was a Complete success!",positive
"It's a Keg! A big fancy one, too! I loved our booth for two. Service was really friendly...my favourite part was when our pale, red-headed waitress said, ""If you need anything, my name is Coco,"" and then there was a pregnant pause because I'm *sure* this is always followed by some sort of comment at the table. But my dining companion and I kept our mouthes shut....until she left, that is. (She was a great waitress though! Two thumbs up) He got the prime rib dinner which comes with horseradish, and he just asked for more horseradish...not a problem, so I got to use it with my bone-in rib steak. They also offered us steak sauce and dijon mustard, something I've never been offered before at a Keg, and it was also delicious! (the dijon, that is) Only strange hiccup was he asked for a manly drink of some sort on the rocks (can't remember what...) and it came in a martini glass w a cherry and it really threw him off.",positive
Obviously some Kegs will have a slightly better atmosphere than others. This one does not disappoint. The bar area is quite lively and the service has been stellar everytime I have come here. If you are a big Keg fan than I would definitely recommend the Eglinton location. 5 Stars given based on knowing the Keg and expectations of service - in relative terms to other higher end steak houses this may get a 4.,positive
"This Keg location is baffling. Since I work minutes away from the restaurant, I've been to this Keg numerous times for work lunches and more often than not, something goes wrong. Their mistakes aren't that terrible, but it's the simple things that they have trouble with. If you have instructions about your order, like putting the dressing on the side of your salad, it will most likely be ignored. They'll acknowledge it when you say it, but that's really just for posterity. When you come in the restaurant, there may or may not be a hostess there. If you have a jacket, they will sometimes ask if you want to check it, but other times they won't. In my last visit, it took them almost an hour to serve our entrees. They consisted of three salads and a hot dog. On top of that, the waiter hadn't come by our table in 40 minutes after serving appetizers. No water refills, no update on the entrees. When we finally confronted him about it, he immediately said the manager would be over to talk to us. The manager seems like a friendly person, but she doesn't exactly seem like a professional. Instead of being apologetic, she seemed more intent on placating us with humour. She was kind enough to give us our entire meal for free, so I shouldn't complain too much. The Keg Dog was outstanding and the only real highlight of the meal. If you haven't tried it yet, you should. A hot dog with bacon jam is a match made in meat heaven. Overall, the service here is inconsistent but the food is what you would expect from a Keg. It is definitely not my first choice in the area.",negative
"I frequent this location often and I have to say, the staff and managers do a great job. The hostesses sometimes are oblivious when you walk in, but service staff give their all. My fiance ordered a steak once, and it came out a bit too rare. Our waitress took it back and the manager brought out another one. Again, it was not cooked properly and (although my fiance eventually just ate it), the manager came back and offered to re-cook it and ended up taking his whole meal off of our bill. Not necessary but totally appreciated. I love the decor/atmosphere - very romantic and overall a nice environment to eat dinner in. I think it is a couple of notches above the standard cookie-cutter keg restaurant.",positive
"Keg food is well... Keg food. its the same across the whole chain and varies very rarely... but the service in this location is just plain awful. whether you get there with couple of friends for drinks, have a client lunch or plan a corporate xmas dinner ( never again), they will find several creative ways to mess it up. my latest experience with them has been absolutely dreadful: our company booked a dinner for 20 people 2 months in advance. on a Wednesday night - not that busy for Keg. we have checked out the area where we would sit, confirmed the menu, drinks, appetizers. since they messed up a previous client party for us(that's another long story), i made sure to follow up with them few weeks ahead...and two days before the event. and the day of the event. each time the management was struggling to remember our party specifics, which was making us really nervous. anyhow, i was assured that everything is A-ok! on the day of the party, when we walked in, they had no idea who we were. it was a complete disaster. it took them about an hour to dig up our order, we got tons of attitude from the wait staff and the hostesses, and the since they (obviously) gave away our sitting area to another party, we were seated at a very awkward long table. waited for our food and drinks forever. DISASTER! no apologies from the management just demonstrative 'take it or leave it"" attitude. regular dinners / lunches are pretty bed as well. staff completely overlooks you, constantly socializes with each other instead of taking orders. huge difference in service between other Keg locations. save yourself some dignity and have your meal in a place that actually wants your business",negative
"Dear Y&E Keg: I hate you. Really, this place sucks. I feel like a bit of a negative Nancy today - but this review is long overdue. I have had 2 very disappointing meals here. I made the mistake of going here on New Years Eve last year. my group was so overlooked it was unbelievable. We waited over 60 minutes for our food. We were told this was because the kitchen was busy cooking for a large party and the server pointed over to a table of about 15 people. On New Years Eve, you should be more than equipped to handle this. I had reservations way in advance - I can understand that I had to wait to be seated, but not that long for my food. My reservation was for 6:00 and I left here at 9:00. The worst part is the food was mediocre. None of us finished our meals. Just recently I went back here with a friend during the week. I assumed the service would be better. Again, mediocre food - and this time we asked the server to split our bill (at the time of ordering) and when the ONE bill came, he wrote ""Divided by 2 = ________"" I really thought this was a joke, but it was the way he interpreted our request. huh.",negative
"Are you looking for quick burger eats but you're just so tired of Harvey's, McDonald's, Wendy's... etc.. I mean, you can eat those ANYWHERE, right? This is why The Prime Burger is YOUR NEXT DESTINATION! It's a pretty rundown, diner place. Probably not where you want to take your princess girlfriend! The patties are juicy and thick, and everything was soooo good. I had the chicken burger and my two guy friends each had the beef. Onion rings and fries were quite large! And it was SOO filling that even my guy friends couldn't finish theirs! I paid $30 for the three of us (combo -with drink and fries), the service is pretty awesome (down-to-earth owners). There are 4 tables inside and 3 picnic tables outside. We sat outside and watched the LARGE pick-up trucks pull in and out of this place to grab takeout! We didn't see BMW's here (haha!), they're probably stuck at Pmall.",positive
Family run business. Very friendly and nice family. Ready to help you get whatever type of burger you want. Very truck stop sort of location where everything is greasy but good. Don't try to hold a diet in this place. Simple but direct menu selection.,positive
Really friendly staff and when i get good service i tend to be bias i am sorry i like good service. the food was really good too. No complaints.,positive
"Haha...I used to go here about 2-3 times a week before I went on a health kick. Haven't been back in a while, but happy to poke my head in to this place when I can.... Someone below has me laughing about Burly men. Yes, this is a lunch time checkin and you get common people who like a good burger! Reason this place gets a 5 Star is I believe they have the best Halibut Fish Sandwitch in Toronto...and I love Halibut. As someone says before, fries come out fluffy and the fish comes out just right. Ask for Tarter sauce and you GET tarter sauce...like 3 full packages. They want you to enjoy. They have about 5 indoor tables, and about 4 outdoor benches for the summer. Pleasant owner, and newspapers if you feel like putting your head down. Good office lunchtime getaway..... Enjoy UPDATE - The Place closes Dec 21st after 41 years of operation! If you like the place go your last time to pay homage :)",positive
"I absolutely love the banquet burger, poutine and of course onion rings! Banquet burger is dressed with a belt of bacon and a skirt of cheddar cheese. It is incredibly delicious! The hot gravy melts the curds to perfection. Last but not least onion rings! The onion rings are battered in bread crumbs (it is heavy). But nonetheless, it is great food and the price is not overly expensive but it is very fair. You get exactly what you pay for. The owner/chef is very nice to all his customers. Overall, my experience there has almost-always been great!",positive
"Giant, incredibly delicious burgers. Giant, crispy onion rings. Fries are so-so. You can tell the place because it always has a semi parked on the side street, and a truck pulling a digger or other construction-type apparatus in the parking lot. The place is frequented by large burly men in safety vests and hard hats. Hard men who have spent their lives squinting into the sun and working their calloused hands to the bone. Men who know that a good burger doesn't come topped with an avocado salsa or a sharp camembert. This place is a small takeaway with about five 2-seaters inside and a few picnic tables outside. Know what you want before lining up, the service is relatively quick and they like to keep the line moving. Unless you have a gigantic appetite, share the onion rings.",positive
Awesome environment . We love trying out new things . This is not a cookie cutter restaurant! You can taste the love in every bite ! Well be back,positive
This new to the neighborhood Resturant is excellent ! We love the meatballs and the atmosphere too! We also like the manager always friendly and checking in with great accent .,positive
"06/08/2018: I hate giving reviews like this and was surprised by how frustrated and disappointed in this restaurant I was. My family and I had a party of 6. I attempted to make reservations a couple of days prior to Friday, 06/08, but the phone recording says that they only take reservations of 10 or more. Going out to eat at 6:30 on a Friday night with 6 people and not having a reservation is a recipe for waiting, which we were prepared to do. What I wasn't prepared for was seeing two open large tables that were not being seated along with a couple of four tops that were open. When I asked why they weren't seating people, they said they didn't have enough staff. Phoenix is hot so having to wait outside at an overcrowded bar while tables were open started the frustration. Once we were seated, the server did not ask us if we'd been here before and didn't bother to explain the menu. Usually explaining the menu isn't necessary, but this restaurant features unique options to order meatballs and sauce a la carte or choosing a bottom, the sauce and the kind of meatball. This is such a cool idea, but when it's your first time, the server should really walk you through your options. I ordered three a la carte meatballs and the side salad. Again, the server didn't say what type of dressing came on the salad and definitely did not ask me what kind of dressing I wanted. The salad came out and it had balsamic, which I don't like so the salad was sent back. On the turkey meatball, I asked for pesto which didn't taste anything like pesto because they put red sauce in it, again why wouldn't the server bring that up? And overall, I was just disappointed in the service and food. This is a great location, a great idea and a cool layout. I hope they are able to get it together because this restaurant has some great features, but their service has to get better.",negative
Food was good. They had a 45 minute wait for a Wednesday. We got the meat block and bucket of spicy meatballs. The service was friendly. We will go back. Update: went back for Mother's Day. We got there when opened. One of the owners was there and treated us like family. Service and food was great.,positive
"Thanks Joey M for responding to the post. Not sure I can add anything more to the review. My daughter has asked that we give it another try because the food was good, except that the sandwich my wife ordered did not have the pesto sauce on it, hahahaha. So we are going to come back for another try and hope you have the gnocchis. You know what they say, screw me once shame on you, screw me twice, shame on me. I hope this isn't the case..",negative
"Met some friends for happy hour. Heard a lot about this place and being an old fashioned Italian, I had to try there meatballs and wow! They were so delicious. Service was excellent and prices were very good. We were inside being high 90's and after stepping outside it was not bad with the misters. So if it hot and a long wait don't hesitate to sit outside.",positive
"First time here and what an amazing meal. Gino and staff made us feel like family. From the meat/cheese board to the fresh made pasta and wide selection of meatballs. Bring your friends, bring your family. You won't regret it.",positive
"OMG YESSS! I started at the top of the menu and have worked my way down. There are only a few combos left for me to explore. The stuffed gnocchi should not be missed. All sauces are wildly delicious, especially the brown truffle gravy!! Their meatballs are perfect- the charcuterie boards are insane, too! My new favorite place!! Yay Meatballs!",positive
"Went there for a meetup event. We all sat on the patio since the weather was still comfortable. A DJ was spinning some grand tunes. I ordered the HH rigatone chicken, which includes pasta. A couple of my friends ordered the meatballs. (all pictured). The rigatone wasn't bad. Tastier with a bit of the chili flakes. The meatballs, I must admit, I didn't particularly care for. I enjoyed the music the DJ was spinning. For him I'd give five stars. Would I go back? Probably not. Nothing about the food particularly stood out.",negative
"Another amazing meal! We have been here several times and tried a variety of sandwiches, meatballs, and appetizer boards- all are delicious! The decor is fun, outdoor seating abundant service impeccable!",positive
Heard about this place from a colleague and decided to try it out. Place had a wonderful ambience and their meatballs were yummy!! The owner was really friendly and welcoming. Also looked like a good place for just chilling with some wine and appetizers. Can't wait to come for the happy hour,positive
"We visited a second time, with a group, and everyone was raving. We did the bruschetta platter, the mozzarella platter, the hummus platter and then all did our own meatball dishes. Everything was top notch and amazing! The service was incredible, too, everyone is so friendly and helpful. We have recommended this place to many people and they have had a great experience!",positive
"Mid week dinner and the Sicilian Butcher was packed. No wait for a table which was great. The dining area is a warehouse setting with many modern touches with a bar and big wall wine racks. Lots on exterior tables too. My buddies ordered this board appetizer 5 Feet long OMG! I had the meatballs and Fettuccine. The desert was a trio of cheesecake, pudding and cannoli filling with fruit. It was all awesome and loved it all. Gino the server was pure entertainment and kept us laughing with great service. If your thinking about going somewhere else - fuhgeddaboudit!!",positive
"Awesome time, great service and food. Nothing wrong with sitting outside with a charcuterie board, meatballs, and eggplant. Service was warm and friendly. I will definitely be back!",positive
"I'm so sad I wanted to love this place !!!! We came here tonight for the second time for an early dinner and enjoy some Happy Hour. My girlfriend & I ordered a mozzarella board, meatballs, and eggplant Parmesan app. The eggplant was Very delicious and our mozzarella board came out with hair on it gross and our server saw me pulling it out of the food and was very apologetic and said he would get a replacement out well about 20 min later it finally showed up very fresh mozzarella and tomatoes although the bread was burnt and not very appetizing we were still hungry and had to flag down the bartender and ask if we could order more food. So we went ahead and place an order for the bucket of meatballs and they were very gross !!!! I asked for a little extra marina sauce so we could choke down a meatball needless to say we each ate one and just took them home for my friends husband since we couldn't them. We waited and waited and just felt like for sitting right there at the bar the service was sub par he could see our drinks were empty and had our card out and had to ask for the tab which is crazy because there's always people waiting to be seated esp in bar because that's the only place you can get happy hour prices ? To our surprise they charge $5 for extra sauce would have been nice to be told about this ? Especially after hair was in our food and took forever to bring out a replacement they should have given a discount for the bad experience with hair in the food. Needless to say we will not be returning we will continue to go to Postinos better food and happy hour anyway. Our first experience here was much better so maybe just a bad night? The positives here are this location was walking distance to my home and is a beautiful place with a great patio and the eggplant was very good !!! As well as the bruschetta which we had our first time there so would recommend ordering that.",negative
"I have never written a bad review about a restaurant or service before, but I 100% do NOT recommend The Sicilian Butcher. My boyfriend and I went two weeks ago and had Gino, he was amazing and we had the best time! So two days ago I decided to take my mom and my little sister out for a nice dinner. We never have the opportunity to do this, and it was a special occasion. Our server was horrible. I mean the worse server I've ever had in my life, and I'm so upset two days later about the experience that I know I will never be back. SERVERS ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO LARGE PARTIES! Sitting next to an eight top my server didn't write down the correct apps, didn't refill our waters, tried to buss the plates while we were still enjoying, and tried to drop the check without offering desert. There was something wrong with every stage of our not and I still payed 120$ before tip for the worst service I've ever had. He told us the reason it took so long for him to get us water, was because of server stand up. I don't care about server stand up. He had a table. He should make it a priority to make sure we were greeted. I almost asked the hostess if we had a server. I never get to have a dinner with my mom and little sister. The moment was complexly ruined and will only be remembered for the horrible service. Never bring your family here. No care for hospitality or excellent service.",negative
I love going here with my girlfriends for some wine and bruschetta. I'm a vegan and I can eat their tomato bruschetta and pasta with marinara sauce which are amazing!,positive
"The first time I was there with 8 girlfriends, so I got to see and taste the variety offered. The food was so delicious, I couldn't wait to bring my daughter back for lunch. I was not disappointed. The meatballs are delicious, and since I don't always eat carbs, I was delighted to see that I could have a ceasar salad with my meatballs. I would highly recommend, and I can't wait to return.",positive
"This restaurant is wonderful! It has a fun atmosphere with great food. We went when there was a DJ playing on a Saturday night. Our waiter was Gino, and he was great!! He gave us great recommendations. The gnocchi is amazing. We will most definitely be back!",positive
"This was our second time back. First time we experienced 40 minuets or waiting for a table. This time it was about an 1 hour (Wednesday night). I understand this is a fairly new location, however it would be good idea if this place took reservations instead of buzzer system. The hostess seems overwhelmed with people's frustrations. We saw at least 4 groups leave while we waited. The food is decent, but the wait and the over crowded front entry way is chaos.",negative
"We dined on a Sunday night and as expected, there was about a 20 minute wait which was better than we expected as the place always looks busy when we drive by. We were able to kill the time by getting a drink at the bar and chatting with some of the other people waiting for their table. Everyone seemed excited to get going and some of the people were there picking up to-go orders and had nothing but good things to say about the food. After a few moments after being seated our waiter greeted us and was very personable and responded very well to our requests before ordering our food. The food came out and the waiter said that the kitchen actually lost their gas for about 10 minutes and they almost had to close the restaurant! Fortunately, it came back on and the food was fantastic! The gluten free pasta was delicious and the Sicilian meatballs and Amatricana sauce were great as well. I ordered a bruschetta board of the dill and salmon, ricotta and prosciutto, dates and bacon and the mozzarella and tomato. I think the dates and bacon was my favorite but they were all good, and good portions as well. Speaking of which, I recommend getting a board and an order of the meatballs to share. That way you get the best of both worlds. The decor and menu are fun and unique, the staff is courteous and prompt and I definitely think it is worth a shot if you're in the mood for something different.",positive
Been here twice now and loved it both times. If you are a charcuterie fiend like me you'll love it. Their pasta is also super delicious. My husband had the stuffed gnocchi and it melted in your mouth. I'm also a huge fan of the deconstructed cannoli!,positive
"Had high expectations for this place and picked this place for Valentine's Day, but unfortunately everything was bland. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the sauces and meatballs barely had any flavor (we both ordered different meals). The pasta is way over priced for a meal that was nothing special. Very disappointing and won't be back. Only reason I gave two stars was for the service and atmosphere.",negative
"Food was great. I had the ""dry aged"" steak balls with spaghetti and arrabiatta sauce. My wife, Sicilian meatballs with vodka cream sauce. Portions were plentiful. Service was spot on. Only complaint is with the loud music. It was difficult to hear our waiter and have dinner conversation. A dj played disco, dance type music that did not seem to fit the ambiance, nor the middle-aged family crowd.",positive
"Outstanding meatballs! Fresh ingredients and amazing flavors. Tons of options. Kids menu was also very good. Overall, great value. We will be back!",positive
"Wow. Unbelievable. I can't believe we didn't find this gem sooner. It's owned by Tomaso's and you get all that goodness. The charcuterie boards are amazing. We had a meats and cheese board. Then you select a meatball, a sauce and then a base. Meatballs are traditional or eggplant or shrimp and crab. My husband selected Tomaso's and I had Uncle Arthur's. Fabulous. He had Sunday Sugo sauce on pasta and I had amatriciana sauce over creamy polenta. Delicious! Dessert we tried the affogatto which has cotton candy on top. Amazing. And we had the deconstructed cannoli. Yum! Prices are great and service is stellar. We can't wait to go back.",positive
"Seemed a bit uptown urban for us but we were won over soon after we were sat and biting into our meals. The menu is not like anything offered at most of the restaurants in the area, so it was quite fun to look over the menu and try something different from the ordinary Italian fare offered at most of the local restaurants. The service was caring, personable and quick to repair any mishap that occurred in our order. I do believe we will be back and will spread the word.",positive
"Our visit was fantastic! Igor, our waiter, was attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered Charcuterie board, a mix of Italian cheeses, meats, nuts. pickled veggies, jam and baguette. Their cocktail is sublime, with twists on favorites like a Mule made with Peach and Campari. The main menu has you selecting a type of meatball, then a sauce, then a pasta (Or polenta, or bread, or salad). My hubby had polenta, I had fluffy stuffed gnocchi, both with Parmesan cream sauce, and their signature meatball made with Beef and lamb, dense with flavor, NY style, like I grew up with! On to dessert which was a de-constructed Cannoli. This was a bowl of cannoli cream, with mini chocolate chips, and Pizzelles and a bowl of Maraschino cherries (the FRESH ones!). Thanks, Gino, for suggesting it! All in all, this place is our new Italian!",positive
The food and atmosphere here is amazing! Chris was our waiter and was very informative and helpful with the menu. Highly recommend the eggplant Parmesan and the meatballs are Devine!!! They don't currently serve bloody Mary's but Chris still made sure we got them anyway. Can't wait to come back,positive
"Had happy hour - highly recommend! The bottle and board for $19 was very good! Three meatballs, polenta and toasted bread with a nice bottle of wine. We also shared spaghetti and meatballs - another great choice. Service was spot on, too. I will be coming back regularly.",positive
"I FEEL RIPPED OFF CHEATED STOLEN, lied to worse new years ever!!!!!! WASTE OF MONEY! Dont trust them and their management. They are money hungry individuals. Dont waste your time or your hard earned money. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COST! Shame on them for doing what they have done! They charged 155$/pers for their new years party and they ended up seating us at a seperate room which was cold clusterphobic and disgustingly dirty there was no body to come and serve us we felt humiliated and we left right away. If we had of known this was our small table in a small basement with no heating we would have never even bothered. I cant even believe im giving this shit a 1 star. I cant even believe or even start to describe what had just happened to us. I frel like I'm back in USSR and treated like a peasant in a third world country AVOIDDDDDD I REPEAT AVOID!!!!!",negative
We had an amazing experience. We loved the food and the atmosphere. Staff was friendly and provided great service. We really enjoy grilled salmon and the sea bass. They had a great collection of wines.,positive
"Have been at this place at least 10 times already. Unfortunately my friends don't know better. They keep coming back to this place because of life music, Russian food and ambiance. Yeah you've read right Italian place that serves Russian food. Well I am certain that the cook speaks Russian and for many times that I've been at that place haven't seen anything Italian. Regarding food, well that's why I give low rating. I'll say only that my mother on a bad day makes better food. Should be enough. So if you wanna come to meet some Russian chicks or just meet Russian people, have some vodka and listen or dance to Russian music go there on Friday or Saturday nights. Oh and it's expensive considering the food you get.",negative
"Very friendly staff... good collection of wines, fresh and tasty food! cool and classic decoration! that's all you want from a restaurant. Check their promotions as well!",positive
"Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word ""delicious"" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!",positive
"Uncle Joe's always been a solid choice I always get 1 of 2 choices: The all day breakfast option of the Western Omelette (safe. great omelette and comes with home fries) OR The Uncle Joe's Burger. (amazing burger flavour! Straight from the grill and surprises us every time with the taste!) I don't really think the rest of the menu has ever been items I would re-order, hence why I tend to stick back with the regular two options. Mostly, I just love the homely environment and the staff are so kind here. :) Sometimes we do a family dinner and reserve a lamb leg, which they always get just right!!",positive
"Nothing overtly offensive about this place, yet nothing special either. My father had the open faced beef sandwich and seemed to enjoy it. I had the club sandwich and it was standard, what I'd expect if I made it at home, which I do frequently. My kids had chicken fingers and pasta.The food was standard diner fare. The place was empty and the decor needs a refresh.",negative
"Enjoyed my meal! Party of 7, lots of choices. Had the veal Parmesan. Family had rack of lamb, rib eye, meals came with garlic bread and soup. Though the decor is dated, it was a clean restaurant. I believe it is a family owned restaurant, the staff was very friendly.",positive
"I'm not sure why this restaurant is sitting at 3.5 stars. I think this place is below average, and here's why (I'm basing this on the one time I've been - maybe I just had a bad experience). The food is mediocre at best and it doesn't taste like anything special. All it does is fill you up. I came here after my boyfriend's friend recommended it. I did also check out the yelp reviews (but only looked at the rating at that time). We decided to give it a go for brunch on the weekend. From the outside, it looks like a tiny shop but it's big on the inside and we were seated promptly. I was already disappointed when I walked in because I was misled to believe that it was Italian cuisine, but it was just an Asian-run Western-style restaurant. I didn't like the atmosphere inside (it was loud and felt like a dim sum restaurant). The decor was dated. There were crumbs on my table before I even sat down. No, they didn't bother wiping it. I had to wipe it off. The food was inexpensive and came in large portions in comparison to other brunch places. I personally could not finish my Eggs Benny. The service was very ""meh"" and I suppose it was because they were quite busy as it was a weekend. My boyfriend and I both agreed that we never want to come back here, and had no idea why his work buddies raved about it.",negative
"Simply asian western restaurant with dirty floor and chairs, they definitely need a renovation. We ordered new york steak and lambs. As you can see, the presentation of the dish is meh, both are decent, nothing much to say. And for the mashed potatoes, we spotted a fly on top of it which was gross. Although, she did change the potatoes, but I just lost my appetite. Do not understand why are other yelpers giving it high stars, maybe that's my unlucky day? However, if I am going to rate it just for the steak, I will still give it 2-3 stars. But in general, the environment isn't pleasing at all, everything is just dirty (cups, plates with lipstick mark and fingerprints). Probably will not come again, they should actually attend the Kitchen Nightmares.",negative
"Having steak there every month is our family routine. Waitress are friendly, and the food is always nice. Feeling like home there. Also, they are carrying the new year special menu recently with lobster, do not miss it.",positive
"Came here with my family the other day, between us we got the fish and chips, chicken with teriyaki sauce, steak and fish. My fish and chips were great especially for the price, fish was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the fries were fantastic. I tried some of the chicken and it was very good as well, and I had no complaints about the fish and the steak. Our server Anne was friendly and attentive. The only thing I wasn't into was the decor, I can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm. I sat in the back, where the lighting was much better, but there was an area that smelt terrible.",positive
"I always wanted to try this place out for breakfast but never woke up early to get my bum there. Mom wanted to try something different so I suggested here. She got the peppercorn steak with a side salad and mash potatoes in medium rare. The steak was meh... mash potatoes were not smooth at all. For 8oz it was $23? I got the half tach ribs. These were by far the worst ribs I've had... it was clearly not marinated, meat did not fall off the bones. And it was tough to eat. The BBQ sauce was just slathered on and if you scrape it off you can see the meat looks boiled. It did not looked like it was barbecued. For the price I would never paid to go back",negative
Loved it. The server who I presume was also the owner was very welcoming and friendly. I had the in-house burger and thought that it was one of the best which I haven't had in a long time! Their fries and onion rings are super crisp! A great place to stop for a bite to eat!,positive
"It had been a while since we came here and decided to come for supper. There was a table available when we arrived but later there were people waiting for tables. The restaurant is older in style and offers the basic family restaurant food. I had the hot hamburger and my wife had the curry rice (which was not on the menu but she overheard someone else order it). My wife said her curry rice was not that great. My hot hamburger was delicious, especially the gravy that was on top. Price was great (under 25$ for both) and the staff was friendly. The washrooms are located in the basement so not accessible for wheelchair or some seniors.",positive
I've never had Veal Parmigiana with zero Parmesan cheese on it and no mozzarella. Instead got 2 cheese blend of cheddar. Yuck! Spaghetti was done properly - not over cooked. Steamed vegetables were okay too. Coffee is very good. Didn't hang around for dessert.,negative
"The food was pretty good and has never been an issue at this restaurant. The prices are fair as well. After the last visit, I don't think I will be going back again during busy hours. The restaurant seems understaffed in my opinion and it took forever to flag one of the three staff down. We were kept waiting for our order to be taken, for our dishes to be cleared after the main course, and to get the bill after dessert. No one ever came around to offer refills on drinks. I do feel for the staff members though, as they didn't seem to have a moment to rest. Note that this restaurant is not very accessible. There is a step at the entrance, and a couple steps to get to the back room. The washrooms are down in the basement.",negative
"Horrible from the start! Bad service, bad food and bad experience today. Icing on the cake was receiving my salad ten minutes after i finished my meal. Had they have asked how my meal was or if I needed anything i could have reminded them sooner. Never again",negative
"Lamb leg is fantastic. Need to pre-order. Comes with seafood chowder which may have been great and may have been awful, but I couldn't say since my 4 year old gobbled it all up. Also has sides of rice,vegetables and garlic bread, all of which are done well.",positive
"Have come here for both lunch and breakfast and haven't been too disappointed. Prices are good and portions aren't bad. Reminds me of old school diner food. The fish and chips are quite popular for lunch with good portion sizes. I like the fact that the batter is nice and crisp and not oily. Burgers are diner style pre made patties- nothing special but good if you're looking for a simpler meal and don't want fast food from the big chains. Although I'll say this, the steak and lamb shank is really delicious and tender! Decide is outdated, there front of the restaurant is dark and old but there back is older but bright... Appears to be a remodel of storage room or something.",negative
"First time here. Its a small family style resturant run by chinese. Price is reasonable . Food suprice me is very good comparing other chinese chef cooking a steak. 3 of us order one halibut steak, pork chop with mushroom sauce, n 10oz new york steak. I also upgrade my soup to an onion soup for just for $3.5. This resturant definatly not the highend steak house, but with the price they have, you cant complain. I will come back for sure",positive
"Took my kids to have dinner here. They have ""All Day Breakfast"" - which I knew I couldn't go wrong. However the kids wanted the kids menu, which was great as well. The restaurant is cosy and it has its regulars. The food is ok, your typical American Food. I had a Uncle Joe's Burger, it was quite good. Not sure, if it was because I was hungry.",positive
"I don't understand why the reviews are so bad... I ordered a prime rib steak and it was very juicy and tender?and the seafood soup was rich and delicious, but a little bit salty. Price was reasonable. Overall better than The Keg.",positive
"We ordered an all day breakfast vegetarian omelette, and grill chicken with veggies that came with a seafood soup. We loved the taste because it is not very strong (Good for people who want to eat healthier and less sodium) Price is amazingly cheap compare to other home style restaurants in that area . Two meal less than $25 ( tax included). Server was friendly.",positive
"The day before Canada Day and Inspire Restaurant was closed and Lemon Bistro were all reserved apparently so had to settle for Uncle Joes. The name of the restaurant is very decieving. This place is actually a Chinese run place serving western dishes. I have to say the food is not bad but not really impressive either. Just decent. Ordered a half rack of ribs for $15.99 which comes with mash potatoes and gravy, veggies, a single slice of garlic bread and a cream soup. I really liked the soup. It was thick and had lots of flavour to it. The ribs were not the type of ribs I was expecting. I thought they would be baby back ribs but they were more like beef ribs in size. The sauce was not very impressive and really found that I was rushing myself to finish the ribs. Also got a 1lb of deep fried chicken wings. The batter was very thick and the BBQ sauce on the side was terrible. Thank god they put the sauce on the side. Also had pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the bacon was crispy with a nice crunch to it. Overall a decent place at best and I think they do breakfast type food better than the other things on the menu.",negative
"Food is decent, but the service is absolutely horrible. We had a question on one of their menu items, and basically the Chinese old lady basically walked off and asked in Chinese to the manager to ""deal with the customer"". They have absolutely no idea how to serve western food at all. The staff seems to be fine with talking on the phone while serving their customers while texting with the other hand, true story. You've been warned.",negative
Great spot!!! The hollandaise sauce is amazing and the coffee is out of this world! Friendly staff and very speedy service. The food is quite tasty and the decor is quite nice. The chandelier gives it a rustic look! It's good to see a family business buzzing with customers on an early Sunday morning. They support local business and advertise them on the plate mats which I thought is noble. A definite spot to try out :D,positive
"It's another traditional/comfort food, but done just mediocre. The decor seems too dingy and and seats aren't the most comfortable. Prices were okay - about what you'd expect for a typical lunch or dinner, but the quality fell short. We were informed that some sauces were out and so we had to get terriyaki sauce with our steak?! Service was fairly lacking, even on a night with just 2 small tables to serve! The kitchen seemed pretty close, as it was fairly noisy with clanging once in a while.",negative
"This review is for a dinner experience only. Overall, 2.5 stars Uncle Joe's is a diner. Its all day breakfast is renowned, but the dinner experience has room for improvement. We ordered a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and a French Onion Soup as starters, and a Seafood Salad and Cajun Burger as entrees. The French Onion soup was really good, with lots of cheese, onion, and sodium (we love salt). The shrimp cocktail was refreshing, but the shrimps were definitely not jumbo (misleading menu). The seafood on the salad was just fake crab meat and a few shrimps, but I will give it that, though uninspiring, it is not false advertisement. The Cajun Burger was not spicy in any way. It was a plain burger. As a plain burger, it was good though. Lesson learned is that 1) the descriptions in menu are over inflated, 2) stick to basics like hamburger, not fancy Cajun burger and 3) order all day breakfast if at all possible.",negative
"I've had all-day breakfast here a number of times, and it's always been well prepared for a reasonable price. The service is good, and it has a diner atmosphere. The decor is pretty cheesy -- there's horrible prints on all the walls for some reason -- but it feels nice and homey. If you live nearby or are in the area, this is a solid choice if you are looking for a traditional bacon and eggs sort of breakfast.",negative
"I decided to try it out one night with my boyfriend and....I LOVEEEEEED it!!! We both ordered the ""Uncle Joe Burger"" and when it came...it was the biggest burger I had ever seen..all for $6.99!! First of all, there was a nice juicy layer of beefy patty, with 2 strips of bacon on top, a pile of mushrooms and melted cheese all over that....yum!! there was also lettuce, tomatoes, pickle...you know, the basics. All of this came with fries or you can add soup or salad for $1 more. It is definitely the best place to have a burger!",positive
"The restaurant has good service and food quality. I ordered Sea Bass and was really tasty and delicious. I had a great time enjoying my dinner with one of my friends which ordered the New York steak. The atmosphere was good and the parking was easy to find once you know. There is a lot of parking space at the back. Nearing the end of the dinner, we also got the Cheese cake which was also good. I definitely recommend dining here",positive
"I know going in what this place is like. I've been there before, and a further disclaimer I'm from Hong Kong of Chinese descent. The service wasn't too good to start off with. Dishes arrived late, orders were wrong and the food....where should I start. We were a party of 11, I ordered a rib-eye that was supposed to come with a salad. First of all the garlic bread had ZERO garlic flavour in it. Then there's the steak. I ordered it rare, it came medium-rare. Yes there's a difference and yes to me it makes a difference. My girlfriend's cousin ordered a surf and turf (lobster & angus steak) and while she wanted medium well, it came as rare. Not only that, they mixed up her order AND it was originally (the mixed up dish) was delivered late. They fixed the order, but the order came with only lobster and they served the steak after. When we left, I looked at the kitchen. No wonder they always screw things up. 2 guys manning the kitchen with dockets flying out of the machine is just a recipe for disaster. Not only that, the ""grill"" is just a 2 burner griddle. Good luck getting your cuts of meat cooked properly on that joke of a ""grill"". Would NOT go back.",negative
"Great prices, good service, OK food. Went on a Sunday for brunch and had eggs benedict, no option for hash browns with it, only mashed potatoes with gravy or fries. Was just OK. Other people had french toast, just OK, omelette with mushrooms was thumbs up. Menu had lots of variety so everyone can find something they like. Steaks, burgers, all day breakfast.",negative
"I went there this past weekend with my family for my belated birthday dinner. Including me, there's four people in my immediate family so we decided to each get something different to try out their different dishes. I got a rack of lamb, my sister got veal parmesan, my mom got a new york steak, and my dad got grilled chicken. The salads were pretty normal, like nothing special, but my mom did compliment their Italian dressing. All four of us loved their bread. It was toasted, but oh so soft with light butter. While the rest of my family chose a salad over soup, I got the fish chowder. It was amazing. I'm a huge fan of soups and tried many different kinds. It was obvious that the ingredients in the chowder was all fresh and was not oily at all. Its consistency was just right, not too thick nor too watery. As for the entrees, they were amazing as well. I loved it when there's a bit of redness in my meats, and they were just cooked to the point as we requested. The mint sauce that came with my lamb was the best part of my entree. I've had lamb many times, but it was the first time that it came with such great mint sauce on the side. Near the end of it I felt like I want more lamb just to dip into the sauce. Their grilled chicken was also great. At first I thought it's probably nothing special, like ordinary chicken. But their chicken was so tender and you can just taste the gilled lines on the chicken..if this even makes sense. We also got baked potatoes as our sides and it came with a huge stand for compliments filled with their very own sour cream, bacon bits, and chopped onions. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very nice. It had a very cozy family or neighborhood style. Once we entered the restaurant they gave us a round table because the waitress knew we were a family of four, so a round table would give a more family-feel, very considerate of them!",positive
"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick snack after touring the nationality rooms at Pitt. While looking at the menu posted at the door a gentleman leaving suggested we try the pierogi. We had the pierogi appetizer which was delicious! It was three potato pierogi topped with melted cheddar and green onion with sour cream on the side. We also each had a bowl of soup which we both enjoyed. His soda and my ice tea were endless but I never got around to asking for a refill because the glass the drink was served in was huge!! Think 32 oz or larger. At the end of the meal I decided to try the $2 brownie sundae which was the perfect size dessert. The moist brownie, small scoop of ice cream and rich hot fudge was just enough without putting us in a sugar coma. If you are in the area, definitely give this place a try.",positive
Hey just because I've been coming back for their steak a lot. Solid NY Strip! Flavor is good and the temperature has always been good. The meat is surprisingly good quality and makes for a nice dinner,negative
"I'm a big fan of the Union Grill and have some favorites, one of which is the Po Boy shrimp sandwich. I was disappointed that it was no longer available. I didn't suffer too badly as the union fish sandwich is always good but would sure have enjoyed the 'po boy'.",positive
I like Turkey devonshire. I like the way tomato neutralizing the greasy taste brought by the cheese. My favorite is crab cake burger though! It is huge but you will not feel overwhelming.,positive
"Super nice people and good food. I was in town for work and left my sunglasses there. To my surprise, the noticed I left them and handed them off to me the next day. Recommend.",positive
"Truly good, home cooked meals and my friends and I have gone here for almost 10 years years since we were in college. Every once and a while, the owner Eric has the silly idea that he should take the turkey burger off the menu. It's the best we've ever had and the reason that we go there. Even the wait staff, who are fantastic, have no idea why he took it off the menu!! They even went so far as to guarantee that it'd be back on the menu by the end of the year since it's so popular. Can't wait for that so that we can go back!",positive
"Incredibly affordable, great-quality food! My girlfriend and I ate here, with dessert, for under $40. Try doing that anywhere else in the city! The staff was excellent and the food met all of our expectations. I will definitely be going back!",positive
"Turkey Devonshire lived up to billing!! Took a friend here for lunch, he ordered the corn beef sandwich when our meals come out he looked over at the Devonshire and had total buyers remorse! My only problem on next visit is the dilemma of choosing to get the Devonshire or the fish sandwich I've reading great things about!! Hmmm, great problem to have!!! This place just moved into my Top 5 pgh spots",positive
"Very disappointed I just had the Jamaican Mahi sandwich and the brownie sundae. The sandwich was pretty good, but there was something seriously wrong with the brownie. I suspect it wasn't mixed properly. One side of the brownie was fine, but the other side had a very chemically taste that made it inedible. I informed the waitress and to my dismay she didn't offer to remove it from the bill. So I deducted it from her tip.",negative
I would rate less than 1 star. There were 3 people at the bar counting me. Bartender took over 5 minutes to come over. It took 42 minutes for 2 take out sandwiches. There couldn't have been more than 20 people in the restaurant. This is the third and last time I come here. All three times service was horrible!!!,negative
Men's Bathroom private stall has 3 locks! Not because one broke and they replaced it and then that broke and they replaced it. Because they care that I am safe while excreting. I appreciate this. I haven't actually ate any food. I just came in to use the bathroom. I however feel extremely safe doing so. Good job Union restroom planners.,positive
"Will not be returning. The wait is always super long. My water had a long blonde hair in it, which was incredibly disgusting, and the waiter cracked a joke that I did not appreciate. If you're a vegetarian you are stuck either getting pasta or pizza, and for both those things there is better in Pittsburgh. I thought maybe the $10 wine list could help me get to like this place more, but the wines they chose were not great. Maybe that list rotates, and wine is a highly subjective thing, but I was not a fan.",negative
"I dined at the Union Grill last Summer with my friends and our moms (girls night out), and we had a wonderful time! The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. We especially loved the smores dessert that we ordered! In addition, the service was solid for us having a larger group (8 people). I will definitely be going back!",positive
Everything on the menu is great but I highly recommend the fish tacos. Amazing and inviting staff make this one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh.,positive
"This was probably my favorite place I ate while I was in Pittsburgh. They had a very eclectic menu sampling foods from many different cultures. All of the foods we ate at our table were delicious and the items on other tables looked appetizing. We had an order of cheese pierogi's (sorry for spelling). These were ok. A little bland, but I was informed that this is slightly normal for pierogi's, especially if you are used to other types of dumplings. We also ordered hummus. This was fantastic. It came with a generous serving of hummus as well as pita, olives, tomatoes, peppers, and other toppings to combine and eat with the hummus. Our third and last item was the Matzo ball soup. Very delicious Matzo ball soup. Extremely simple, but bursting with flavor. This was hands down the best item we ordered.",positive
"What a gem! Had dinner with my daughter here tonight. The place was packed but we were able to be seated right away. Our waiter, Drew, was busy but made sure to greet us as soon as he could. He was personable, warm and made eye contact. I had the rainbow trout which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. My daughter had the Carolina BBQ sandwich and loved it too. Even the house salad...a very simple basic salad was full of flavor with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing it came with. We were too full for dessert even though we could only eat half our meals and didn't have starters. The portions are huge, the price is low, the food is wonderful and the service is great? We will be eat there again and recommend strongly for casual dining.",positive
"Rolled into Pittsburgh for the Carnegie Mellon graduation, the hotel recommended this place for a nosh that was within walking distance of the hotel. A great selection of local beers on tap. AND PEROGIES! Traditional and pot roast. YUM! There's a menu item to scratch any itch. Portions are ample. What you see is what you get. This is a straight out drink and stuff-your-face kinda place.",positive
"Union Grill is one of the better options on S. Craig. I've been here several times, the latest being a week ago. On my most recent trip, I ordered the turkey Devonshire, based on the comments of other reviewers, and since I'm always keen to try local specialities. Although it was filling, I found it a bit bland in flavor. My dining companion ordered the ""barbecue"" chicken (read: roast chicken with barbecue sauce) with waffle fries, both of which were good. During past visits, I've ordered the church pierogies, which are a good specimen of the dish for PGH (I've heard that they get them from a local church, though I can't vouch for it), and come with a generous helping of sour cream and caramelized onions on top. Though I've never personally ordered from it, they have a $10 wine list, which my labmate tells me contains wines that sell for at least twice that at the upscale bars in PGH. (I'll have to try it next time I return.) Service is generally good, and I like the atmosphere. (Try to get one of the outdoor tables if the weather's nice!) 3.5 stars.",negative
"A delicious burger made of turkey...check. A swank looking place on the inside that is somewhat hidden from the outside...check. A staff all dressed alike that distinguishes them from the guests...check. All in all, I would say this place nailed it. From the look of the inside to the friendliness of the staff. Granted I did not dine in house, but I was able to scope out the place. Upon arriving after I placed my order I walked in and was greeted warmly by the hostess who informed me that my order would be ready at the bar. It was so very tempting standing by the bar and not ordering a drink. But being that I was at work and on my lunch, I could not imbibe. From the looks of the drinks that nearby patrons had, I may have to come this way for a nightcap. Once the bartender was finished making up the drink she was in the process of perfecting, she was onto me. Swiftly she grabbed my bag, rang up my bill and swiped my card. After that I was out the door. Once I was able to eye my food, I was not disappointed. The turkey patty was enormous. To say that it was flavorful would be an understatement. The cooked it perfectly and somehow had this delicious crispiness surrounding the outside of the patty. The bread was fresh, very fresh and slightly toasted. I opted for their in house made mustard sauce and was that ever pleasing. Creamy and with the best combination of spices made it compliment everything else that was on the patty. No need to worry either if it will overpower the whole burger as everything melded together in my mouth. That, my friends, is how you do a turkey burger. Along with the burger came a pickle spear and a side of waffle cut fries. Both good, but not as amazing as the burger itself. I will definitely be back to get another turkey burger from here, and hopefully this time I will be able to sit and enjoy the atmosphere on the inside as well.",positive
"Union Grill is a good place to go if you have a long lunch break--the service typically takes a while. The sandwiches are a bit uninspired, but their baked onion soup (just another name for French onion soup, as far as I can tell) is delicious and definitely worth the wait. I can't really recommend any of the other dishes, but if you like hamburgers, give it a try.",negative
"I have been a long time patron of the Union Grill. I love the food especially the burgers and drinks. The food comes out fast and we can be out in under 45 minutes. Me and my husband go there before every lecture and River City Brass Band at CMU. They have the best bartender in the city! Christian makes the best martini's I have ever had. This place gets very busy and no matter how crazy it gets there, my drinks are perfect every time! They also have great desserts if you have room left. The hot brownie with mint ice cream is delicious.",positive
"Amazing as usual! We come here all the time and LOVE it! Try the pot roast, trout or basa! Prices are reasonable. Everything we have ever had is delicious but the best part of the Union Grill is the staff. The bartender Drew gives awesome recommendations of wine (from the unbelievable $10 wine list) The chief Mike is without a doubt one of the best in the city, our favorite though is the waiter Tom! Ask for Tom he is knowledgeable about the menu, friendly and makes the meal truly enjoyable. If you want a great night out come to the Union Grill! ( p.s. miss the dates on the side salad though, maybe they will make a come back?)",positive
"Visited Pittsburgh recently, decided to go here for lunch based on the reviews here on Yelp. I definitely wasn't disappointed. I ordered a burger (med-rare) with provolone cheese, banana peppers, and onions, and it was perfectly cooked. It was nice and crisp and browned on the outside and the inside was exactly medium rare. They definitely use a unique blend of cuts here, because the burgers don't taste like regular burgers. They're on the steak-y side, which is really nice. Best burger I've had in awhile or maybe ever. My girlfriend got the grilled cheese special with spinach, provolone, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers. She enjoyed that and was quite satisfied. The service was excellent too.",positive
"Their burgers are quite good and ridiculously large. One thing's certain: you won't be going away hungry. Also be sure to check out the $10 wine list...you can't beat the price. Overall: Union Grill has good food, is reasonably priced, and is very close to CMU. It's definitely a bit pricier than the other offerings on Craig Street, but there's a reason why.",positive
"We have been going here for the past three years and never had a bad thing! The service is always great, and the food is amazing. You can't go wrong with the $10 bottle of wine menu. All of their prices are reasonable, sometimes you have to wait but it is worth it!",positive
"""It was a dark and stormy night...er...rainy afternoon..."" This is the perfect spot when you're not sure what you're in the mood for. With a little bit of everything it has some great specials and you can modify almost any item to your liking. Union Grill was packed and embodied a ""where everybody knows your name"" vibe. Other places we thought about going were on the empty side. We ended up snagging bar seats, the usual MO for us anyway. The wait staff was so attentive. They all shared the bar tending responsibilities, so there was never a moment when no one was checking in on us. You can tell this place runs like a well oiled machine. The clientele ranged from college students to men in suits. Decor lends itself to this range of customers as its very homey/irish bar feeling. Great place to grab a bite on your lunch break or sit down and chill for a couple hours with your favourite cronies...a la ""How I Met Your Mother"". Prices were certainly reasonable and they had an expected range of beer on tap as well as a full bar. The ciabatta chicken sandwich and the burger, whichever version or toppings you get on either, are fantastic. I wish I had a place like this in my college town back in the day.",positive
"I found myself at this fine establishment last night with my roommate. Since I was in a abnormally random mood, (I blame the nap prior) I decided to partake in a nice cold beer, salmon with hummus and brownie smothered in mint chocolate chip ice cream all at once. The very experience itself was fun and I have to say the staff was very supportive of my meal decision which was refreshing. The service was not the best but also not terribly slow. Price was right in the middle between cheap and expensive. The lighting was dim and reminded me of an old time hotel. The food itself was pretty good but not something to write home about assuming you still write letters which is pretty unique and I applaud you.",negative
"It's true. Their burgers are damn good. And I fell bait to the Artisinal Cheeseburger the first time - best decision ever. Second time, I had the Local, which was still good, but not as good as the Artisinal. Their burgers are definitely big, hearty ones with just the right amount of dressings. It's really all in the meat that makes it so good at Union Grill, cooked to perfection, juicy and super satisfying! The atmosphere is kinda dimlit but really cozy feeling. It's got a charm of an English pub sort of. I suppose it's one of the classier places on Craig Street, a place where college students would get their takeout fix at neighboring restaurants like Maximum Flavor, Little Asia, Orient Express, and Lulu's Noodles. As a CMU student myself whose lab was on Craig Street, I can certainly attest that going to Union Grill for a beer and a meal was a treat. I never made it out to their wine night specials but it seems worth checking out.",positive
"The name says it all in a way. Eating at this place is like joining a union. What I noticed most about this place is all the rules they have for their patrons. It's not that the rules are particularly heinous, just that the rules are so blatantly advertised. First there's a big sign that says they won't seat you until your entire party is there. Then the menu has rules about no sharing, they will charge you extra. I think there were more rules on the menu than that, but I don't recall them exactly. I found these well advertised rules condescending, unnecessary and made me feel like they were doing ME a favour by letting me eat at their restaurant. Thanks, but no thanks. There is nothing particular noteworthy about this place, except there are no other ""American"" translation ""Middle-class white suburban"" sit down restaurants on that part of Craig St. I wasn't particularly impressed. They do not have the best burgers in the 'burgh or even Oakland. Maybe they have the best burgers on Craig St. in between Forbes and Fifth Ave? I don't know, I haven't tried the burgers at that pizza place with the aluminum foil swans.",negative
"This is a great place for lunch . . . but get there early or wait until the massive lunch crowd is gone . . .everyone wants to eat here. The food is always good . . at least I've never been disappointed. And the fresh warm sweet potato chips are worth it, if you eat nothing else. There are a few tables outside, but the inside is cozy and inviting. The service has always been good. The only reason they lose a star is that sometimes you could faint from hunger driving around trying to find a place to park. Like I said, you are not the only one who wants to eat here and they all have their cars in the limited street spaces! Walk to get here . . . you are going to need the exercise after a big lunch!",positive
"I bought a gift certificate for my parents for Cupcake Binge/Unwined for their anniversary. When my parents went there, it was closed. This was two weeks after I bought the gift certificate. I have since emailed, called and sent a message on their facebook page and have gotten no reply. I understand they had a problem with their landlord, but they could have at least returned my calls/emails. Their website has stated since August that they are looking to reopen at another location, but now it is October and I guess I can say goodbye to my $50.00.",negative
"We really enjoyed it there last night with another couple. We sat outside and it was very nice. It got a bit noisy when the trains came by, but we like trains so that was not a problem for us. The patio does face the street, and some might not lke being that close to the street -- there were a lot of options inside. We each sampled 3 wines (three two ounce pourts for $7.49). The list was not large, but there was something there for everyone, and everyone settled on a glass of wine that they enjoyed. We tried a couple of the different pizzas and they were very good too. Mine had fresh basil -- and I know it was fresh because I saw our server picking it right before they made the pizza! This is also ""Cupcake Binge."" in the same facility. I did not have a cupcake but everyone else said they were good. We hope to go back -- it was very empty on a beautiful Saturday night -- hope they are able to generate some more business. They were missing a few things on the menu, and our bill had a couple of errors, or I would have rated it at 5 stars. Also, I asked for a glass of water -- apparently you can only get water by the bottle (we were charged $1.00 per bottle). Most wineries provide water in small cups at no cost.",positive
"So I can't rate this place based on food or drink or anything because me and a couple friends and my husband came here after work one day, mind you their website said they were open and if you call them their recording says their hours which say they are open, and they were closed. This is also attached to Cupcake Binge and I believe is probably the same owner. We were extremely disappointed. I just think if you are going to list your hours you should be open during them, that's all. I will not be going back, first because I don't believe in supporting a business that lies to it's customers, and second because you will never know when they will be open and I'm not wasting another trip.",negative
"Being the ridiculous insomniac that I am, the only way I can get to sleep is usually by drinking a strong glass of wine. In doing so, there's very few wineries I've not visited & even fewer I would return to. However, unWined is a place I can see myself frequenting :) It is truly unique & I mean that in the best way possible! Our waitress, Amanda, was so adorable & perfectly attentive. I did not catch the other womans name ( I think she might be the owner..she's Irish/Italian) but she was equally as pleasant and interesting to speak with. The atmosphere is bright, vibrant, & colorful- they have handmade games at some of the tables for anyone to enjoy, this really neat wall art piece made out of wine corks, and the food & wine selection was like nothing I've ever tried/seen before. The wine list offered a delicious 'G-Forestglen Moscato' that I have never seen on any other wine list. You'll enjoy this greatly if you prefer sweet/white wines. My husband & I started off our adventure with the grape pizza & lemon ricotta; both starters were absolutely amazing! The lemon ricotta is light & refreshing while the pizza was sweet and tangy; delicious!!!! Yet these two plates made us even hungry for more & we ended up ordering the milk stout & 'small f/c & meat plate'; again, delicious! I can't wait to go back & try their pulled pork pizza & grandma cake :)",positive
"Only tried this place once on a Friday night. They had nice friendly service, average wines. No flights only by the glass. Atmosphere is lacking any interest or comfort. It's echo-y and loud, cold. There was a small party in the private room and then we were the only ones there. Not sure we will go back with other wine bars so close.",negative
"I've frequently stopped here on my way out of Charlotte and have always had good service. This morning was no exception. Ordered the Southern Breakfast, which was to be 2 scrambled eggs, so I asked for 2 more. What I got appeared to be 7-8 eggs. I be full now! #DontWasteTheProtien Thanks for the consistent good service.",positive
"Second time here, second time they messed up. To be fair, the servers are attentive and as polite as can be. I cannot hold the servers accountable, because each time they had the order correct. The food, when it is what you ordered, is tasty. The issue is the kitchen. They cannot seem to get an order right the first time. Today it took three tries to get what I had ordered. If you are patient and have time to have the order corrected, give it a try. For those with tight travel plans, save yourself the frustration.",negative
"Well, its an airport restaurant expect the alcohol prices to be high. $7.50 + for draft beers, $8+ for wine. They have REALLY GOOD NACHOS for $10. It took a loooong time to come out though. Almost 40 minutes. But its a big bowl. The fresh ingredients are fresh, and the roasted fresh corn a nice touch. The seasoned beef was tasty, and the cheese sauce flavorful. Overall the best nachos I've had in a while. Pleased, but it shouldn't take 40 minutes to make nachos!",positive
Came in for a couple of drinks while waiting on a delayed flight. Uptown manhattan. It's just okay but service was nice.,positive
I've been mistreated and even kicked out of some places. I've never experienced anything just like this. These jerks are RUDE. Not sure what I did to get my check thrown at me but i did. Then this cocky barback tender says I can't put my purse in the seat next to me. This bar is EMPTY. I don't think I'm causing anyone to miss a spot. I mean from the time I walked into this place they have been unbelievable. Writing this post to make myself look occupied as I sit here and finish this half azz Moscow Mule.,negative
Most disgusting breakfast I've ever eaten in a US airport. Bacon over salty. Eggs were bland and I assume powdered. The coffee sucked too. They could easily do better.,negative
"The best service at any airport bar I've been to. Jessica, Amanda and Regina were so welcoming and warm at 11am on a Thursday. Really made us want to stay until our board time. You can tell they really care about their patrons. Anytime we are in clt we stop by here. Thanks!!!!",positive
My flight was delayed Thursday afternoon so I stopped by for a drink. I sat at the bar with Ashley. She was very personable and made my wait enjoyable. Definitely coming back. Cocktails were great but Ashley made my experience even better!!,positive
"I understand this is an airport bar. But I would've ordered food, and 3 times the drinks had my server ever said more than one word to me when she first took my order. Apparently ""would you like to order any food"" or ""would you care for another drink"" simply wasn't as important as checking her phone constantly. Oh well, my money is HAPPILY welcomed elsewhere...and from now on will be. Just ""Wow""! Train. Your. People.",negative
"Food here is good pub fare, what really set it apart on my last visit through Charlotte airport was the service which was awesome. Our waitress Stephanie was very engaging with everyone in our section, ensured our food came out quickly and made sure we were comfortable. She was extremely attentive and always had a smile!! Helped with the stress of rushing through an airport.",positive
"There are not many choices in this section of the airport, though I am thinking that will change once the new A gates open. We were not interested in Wendy's and the people are always friendly here (and they serve alcohol:) There's a nice bar; seating is alittle cramped but if you like watching everyone going by, you can sit at their outside-the-bar tables. I like that they are so accommodating: I am in a no diary, no gluten phase, so I had to ask for my Bacon Burger with no cheese & no bun, and my side salad with Oil & Vinegar (The oil I got was Olive Oil). The waitress was just like 'no problem' and as sunny as can be. I received some large lettuce leaves with the burger which were big enough to make a paleo lettuce wrap out of the burger. The House Salad was fresh. My husband had the BBQ pork and was happy. Nothing outstanding but good fresh food before a long flight and no worries about feeling under par from eating the wrong things. Drinks are adequate. We have had breakfast here before and once again they are accommodating & fresh. All in all a good experience every time.",negative
Waitress was very nice. Food was pretty terrible. Sit down restaurant with plastic dishes. No qualms about shoveling bag after bag of plastic into the earth. Nachos had ballpark style cheese. Back up soup had to be ordered. Then again the only other choice I saw was Wendy's...maybe the lesson is don't order the nachos. Or the soup.,negative
"Waiting for my flight back to Detroit, I wanted to sit, drink a Guinness, eat and relax and my only choice in concourse A was this place. I certainly am not a sports bar guy but I was limited. Ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and onion rings. They were ok. The onion rings were a bit tough and the burger was slightly over cooked. I was excited to see they had banana pudding cake. But alas, they were out. I had the pound cake instead. Again, it was ok. Nothing great. My waitress was nice and attentive. So if you're in the CLT and have the time, walk over to concourse C to Bad Daddy's (see my previous review) to get an awesome burger.",negative
"Stopped into Uptown this past Monday after missing my flight out of Charlotte. Since I had some time to kill and was frustrated after missing my flight, I wanted a delicious beverage while I waited. Ellen was my server and she made everything better! She was warm and inviting and was always smiling. I think she could sense my frustration and immediately offered an absolut pepper Bloody Mary (which are my favorite). Since I hadn't eaten all morning, I figured I should eat a little something. I asked ellen what her favorite thing was on the menu and she suggested the veggie flatbread with a side of ranch. It was really good and was the perfect amount to tide me over until my next flight. All in all it was a great experience and if I ever get stuck in concourse A again, I will definitely stop back in!",positive
"What do you expect - it's an airport bar. I ordered a chicken salad and it came in a plastic bowl with a lump of half-cooked chicken on top. My standards aren't high for airport-fare, but you can do better in this terminal ;)",negative
Food was OK. Service was great. Avoiding a cockroach under my chair almost made me barf! Watching the server try and stomp on it was comical. Not having a manager deal with the issue is horrible. Not having anyone monitor their yelp comments is typical of horrible restaurants that don't give a shit!,negative
"Server refused to change 1 of 10 TVs to an internationally televised soccer game that my colleague wanted to watch because the ""channels were chosen for the day"". Most of the TVs had highlight reels going, talk shows, CNN etc on given it was 3 pm on a Tuesday. Thanks for nothing!",negative
"Ok drinks. Good service. Terrible good. The grilled chicken salad comes out in a plastic bowl and is not worth the price. The utensils are plastic. Come in for a drink, but don't waste your time with the food. Go to another terminal to eat",negative
"I've eaten here a couple of times for a quick lunch before a flight and the food is pretty good. For those who like ranch dressing it's great here. Today I decided to try it for breakfast and though you're free to seat yourself, I was greeted by who would be my server. It was decent for airport pancakes, bacon, and eggs. My server was cool. Not too annoying, not to absent. The prices are reasonable. I'd eat here for breakfast again.",positive
"As a frequent traveler, I can honestly say I was disgusted with the bar staff and their miserable attitudes today. I usually will hang around for quite a bit prior to my flight; made an exception after today. The female on the early shift (May 21 around noon) was a real gem [insert sarcasm here], especially when you asked her for something. Not even two minutes after I ordered my food, it came out. You can tell it had been sitting under a heater for quit sometime, due to its hard, crunchy taste. An elderly gentleman had closed out his check and came back shortly after. He stated to the bartender that he seemed to have misplaced his card after he left. She responds with ""well it would still be on the bar then, I don't have pockets so I didn't take it"". Umm... I don't think he was accusing you, he just stated he misplaced it. I kindly ushered him to check under his newspaper, as it may be there. He found it and you can tell he was slightly embarrassed. She rolled her eyes and kept walking. I saw her shift was ending and was excited for a fresh, new face to continue enjoying my beer and meal at the bar. Well... The disappointment continued. This clown, at about 1PM, was even more of a jerk than the female he just replaced. The gentleman next to me asked for a Pabst beer and he replied ""sorry we serve real beer here."" I'm sorry bartender - last time I checked, your job is to serve, not to insult your patrons. If you don't carry it, you can kindly inform him that you don't have that beer in your selection. I was surprised the gentleman stayed; however, it was the only bar in the terminal. After that comment, I was done and I grabbed my check. I am a very generous tipper and it pained me to give them 20% for their dismal service. I left half my beer and food at the bar because I couldn't stomach sitting there any longer. To Uptown Management: I think it's time to clean house with your staff or write them up. Smiling clearly is optional here, as they didn't smile once. Note to others: never take a layover in CLT, if you have to, don't go into Terminal A. It will make your layover feel like an eternity.",negative
"This place is NOT a good meal option. My jaw is sore from eating the leather sandwich. They call it a steak sandwich, but I know leather when I taste it. Good thing it came with mushy French fries to give my over worked jaw a rest. Why 2 stars? First, hop drop and roll on draft! Very good. Secondly, good music. Only option to sit down and eat in terminal A. United, please fly out of another terminal!",negative
Surprisingly a delicious and affordable place to get something to eat at the airport while waiting for your flight. My boyfriend and I both ordered a cheeseburger with fries ($11 a piece) and everything was tasty. The service was decent too. Glad we chose this place over the other options in the area.,positive
"Keeping in mind that I came here strictly for a beer during my two hour lay over, I enjoyed this place. I was concerned after reading the reviews but compared to some of the airport bar and grills I've visited throughout the world, this was a solid bar and grill. The local draft beers were $7 which is a fair price in my home locale and definitely in an airport ($10 for a pint in another terminal!!). You can get domestic bottles for $5.25 and imports for $6.25. The waiter was super friendly and let me try two local beers before deciding which one to try. The space is clean and has a variety of seating options- two tops outside patio style, bar, traditional tables and leather club chairs. They also have outlets throughout and a bartender who will charge your phone behind the bar for you. A solid airport bar and grill.",positive
"Man oh man, what a mistake this was. I knew I was in trouble when I asked for medium rare and the guy said ""I'll put it in, but I can't guarantee it"". What does that even mean???? Well I sure figured out quick, as soon as the burger arrives. The patty is perfectly rounded, and even thickness throughout, Which tells me it was not hand made, or fresh. No juices running at allllll. No doubt this came out of the freezer. This is happy meal quality. Oh let's not even get into the fact that they gave me the wrong burger. I honestly feel insulted. Steer clear!!",negative
"Food OK and waitstaff was OK albeit a little slow. The ""seat yourself"" thing just doesn't work. You have clueless people sitting alone at a 4-top, and three sumo wrestlers crammed at a two top. Like most airport restaurants, they seem oblivious to the fact that you might, you know, be in a hurry and that, umm... you might have some personal possessions with you.",negative
"Great customer service, but food was just average. Can't expect much from an airport restaurant, but it was food in the belly before a long flight home. The trend I saw at all the dining establishments I went to in the south were... friendly, southern hospitality service from waiters and staff and bitching and rude customers. Apparently the people who sat down before we did at the same table were total jerks. I guess what they say is true about the south... ""there's nothing like it"".",negative
"Very chill spot! Good food and relaxing! Waitress was amazing! A little overprice, but what do you expect at the airport.",positive
"It's the perfect preflight sit-down for the thirsty traveler! In no way can I recommend this location for the hungry, but the bar menu is excellent for the preflight cocktail. It's a great little place to burn some time preflight. I purchased a couple vodkas on the rocks and they do provide a good pour! Enjoy and have a safe flight!",negative
"Worst possible service. The bartenders are rude and drinks are horrible. When asked to change the channel on TV, they flatly refused without any reason. The food was just about average to bad. Ain't going back again.",negative
"Airport bar. Food looked good, Did not eat. One 12 year old double Scotch on rocks.... more than $35 Dang these airport prices!!! Service was fast and friendly.",negative
"Avoid this restaurant at all costs. We went there to break our fast during Ramadan and ordered food and grape leaves to start. We were told the food would take 15-20 minutes to arrive, then the cashier went to the back to prepare our food after giving us the grape leaves. They were horrible (congealed layer of oil on top). So bad that after a day of fasting my daughter and I couldn't eat more than a bite. Next two young men arrived soon after us. Keep in mind this restaurant was completely empty on a weekend night during Ramadan (unusual for halal places). The young men went straight to the kitchen and were laughing and chatting with the cashier/chef. Soon thereafter we could smell marijuana smoke mixed with the smell of our food. We made the decision to just leave at that point, again after 16 hours of fasting leaving was more appealing than remaining there.",negative
"Terrible service. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Hadn't eaten all day after a busy day at work and thought I'd get a pizza and fries delivered. Checked in two hours after ordering when I hadn't received my food and they said it would be here in another 25 minutes. Another hour went by, it's now midnight and my food never came after 3 hours of waiting. Canceled the order and will never ever give them a cent. They can't deliver a pepperoni pizza and fries 5 minutes away in under 3 hours. You can't even call to say you're running behind to make sure you're not ruining someone's night by not delivering their dinner before midnight? I don't care how busy you might be that is pathetic. What a joke.",negative
Vespuccis used to be a favorite. Those days are over. The past two pizzas we've ordered here have been burnt to a crisp and somehow still cold upon delivery. Vespuccis is not what it was. Very sad to see a good place slip.,negative
Its better than chain stores pizza... P.H....LIL Cs. If you know what i mean..quit being haters wont get you no where.. busy as usual...never had a problem...,positive
"Been a long, slow, painful wait for a simple order. It wouldn't hurt to have a little consistency with the only thing that you make. But let's hope for a change in pace on the apparent laziness that happens everyday there",negative
The pizza was very good for sure. I had a couple slices and was craving some more. If you're looking for halal pizza this is a great place!,positive
Ordered food which never came. Very disappointed in the lack of service. Will not be giving my business again. 1/5 clams.,negative
"Just terrible! My wife and I bought a gift certificate from restaurant.com and in the fine print it clearly says order $20 of food and get $10 off your order. Well, when I went to pick up iur food, the woman at the counter just kept repeating ""no take, no take, no take"". I had her call her manager and he got on the phone. The manager barley spoke any English (just like the woman at the counter) and he said I needed to order $30 worth of food for the $20 gift certificate to work. It was pointless trying to explain to him all of the details and he wouldn't honor the gift certificate. Waste of time and left hungry. Do not waste your time with this place.",negative
"Over the last few years my family has had several lengthy stays @ UPMC Mercy. This restaurant is our go to for takeout. The nursing staff made the recommendation. I always order the staff a XL pizza and it feeds the entire shift. I love their calzones. And the best part, the delivery drivers deliver to the patient's room .... quickly.",positive
"I enjoyed the food pretty well. The stuffed shells were quite good even though the sauce was fairly watery, but the problem I had was that they had a tough time understanding me when I placed the order, then when the order came, a guy who barely spoke passable English called to tell me that the deliver had arrived at my hotel. I asked where I needed to pick it up. He just said okay and went to hang up the phone and so, knowing I wouldn't be likely to get anything else out of him, I said fine and I hung up as well. When I couldn't find him, I called the number he had dialed me from back and no one picked up. When I made my way to where he was waiting, I asked him for change for a ten to give him a better tip, since all I had was a twenty and the food was like $17.95 or something. He just looked at me. He obviously spoke a tiny bit of English. He could've said I'm sorry, I don't understand you, but he didn't. He just stared at me. I slowly explained the situation and asked if he understood and he continued to stare. I pulled a ten out of my wallet and said okay, you give me one five and five ones. I even counted on my fingers (not to be rude or insulting, but to try to demonstrate what I was saying). He took my ten and only gave me a five and two ones. I said no, I need five ones and I once again demonstrated that to him by holding up five fingers and pointing to the ones in his hand. He didn't do anything. I just gave him the $7 back and took my ten and left him with a twenty. I felt badly for giving him a $2 tip, but I literally had no choice. I apologized profusely, but short of ripping the money out of his hand (and you can probably imagine how well that would've gone over) and forcing my money into his pocket, there was nothing I could do. I feel terrible, but it seems like maybe an English as a second language training program or something might be a good thing for this restaurant to implement. I respect the fact that they're hiring workers from other countries, but let's make sure they have the proper training, shall we? This poor guy has a tough job ahead of him.",negative
"For just $20, I was able to buy a large pie, a 16"" hoagie, and a 2 liter soda. How is that possible? Unfortunately, both food items were tasteless and embarrassing. The worst pizza I ever ate was in a suburb of Dallas in 1989 but this was pretty close to that. Even the ranch dressing was tasteless. Does Sysco have a low-end generic brand too?",negative
"Horrible service! Called in an order and they couldn't understand me, so our order was not even ready when I called an hour before pick up. When we arrived, besides being informed that our food was not ready, we were also told that they didn't have one of the items we order....so needless to say, I will never be back here. Plus, we had to sit in the smoky restaurant, from oven smoke, not ciggys, while our eyes burned! Terrible experience!",negative
I have eaten every type of food they offer from salads to pizza and hoagies. I have ordered more times than i can count and look forward to my next order. This is my favorite place to order from downtown and I recommend it to and guests at my work looking for best local pizza place. I have never had a bad experience from this place and the food tastes very good and homemade. They even make their own salad dressings. I Recommend to everyone!!!,positive
"Everyone needs to be aware of how HORRIBLE Pizza Vespucci really is. Although their food is okay at best, and I really don't understand how it has 4 stars on Google, the service I have had with them has been absolutely appalling and I feel the need to share so others do not order from them in the future. The first time we ever ordered from Pizza Vespucci, we got two fettuccine alfredo pastas. They came and the Alfredo sauce was not Alfredo sauce at all, but a watery, milky liquid with noodles. Obviously upset, I called and told them the problem, they insisted we keep it as evidence for them to take back while we wait for the remade food to arrive (obviously not an issue to return the horrid food, who wants to eat noodles in milk water?) So when the remade food arrives an hour later, it looks and tastes how it SHOULD have came the first time. Fine, consistent Alfredo, not watery. Manager called to tell me he made it himself. Awesome. Well, his employees should still know how to make food. Recently, even though we did have that experience, we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and order from them again. Some places have bad nights, I can understand. But no. This time, I ordered beef ravioli and my significant other just wanted soup. They FORGOT MY BEEF RAVIOLI. Actually, apparently one of the guys didn't even ring the ravioli into the order. But somehow they managed to remember to bring the garlic bread! When I called to complain, they asked if I still wanted my ravioli. No, I just ordered it for no reason... I'll never order from there again. It'd be easier to cook at five-course meal at home than deal with Pizza Vespucci.",negative
"This restaurant had construction vehicles and a dumpster blighting the harbourfront for months, right up until mid-June. Disgraceful.",negative
This pub is geared towards the summer tourist crowd which means in the fall and through winter the service level drops to almost nothing. They hire untrained staff for both waiting and the kitchen. I would wait until next summer before you plan a visit.,negative
"This is an anchor location in a highly visible, tourist heavy part of one of the greatest city's on earth. Why don't we have one of our hundreds of high quality, tasty, classy and sexy restaurants occupying this space? It's so shameful, to have a restaurant like this in such a prime corner of the city... Just sitting there, like a little cash cow that I am sure that it is... I would have paid double my bill to have a better experience... Higher quality staff... Better food... Cleaner environment... If I could give this place 0 stars, I would... Shame on them... There is nothing more disgusting than a restaurant that clearly takes advantage of a 'captive audience', by under servicing them and reducing the quality of their food and services to the bare minimum. The thinking is, where else will they go? Truth is Toronto has some of the best food options (from all over the world) to choose from and I encourage travelers to the city and locals to dig a little deeper... You may have to take a quick cab, but it can absolutely be worth it. Until something changes here, my family will go eat something epic in the city and then head down to Queens Quay for the day. It's the best plan.... So many great choices along King/Queen/College/Yonge... I wouldn't waste my money or time on more than a couple of drinks at this place...",negative
"In my office we say that Watermark is short for Water mark-up. Extremely overpriced, you are paying for the view of the lake (which is actually quite nice to be fair). The food is pretty bland and the menu is boring. The Cardinal sin they commit though is serving 14oz glasses of beer at very close to pint prices. Skip this place and walk a little bit further west on queens quay for some (slightly) better options. Unfortunately it seems restaurants/bars think the view of the water exempts them from maintaining quality.",negative
"Nothing fancy here. Just a restaurant by the lake which is nice. Came by for a drink with a friend while enjoying the weather and beautiful view. The server was great, came by to check in on us despite being super busy. Will come back to try their foods in the future.",negative
"Totally understand why reviews are generally lackluster for this place. Nice patios, great location, decent atmosphere, decent service... But food is a half step up from McDonald's, bleck",negative
"I don't see an option for Zero stars...so I guess I'll give 1. But honeslty I was so unimpressed with this place that not only did I have to send back my food, but when the manager came and offered to comp the meal and order something else, I couldn't even eat that either! I couldn't even take advantage of a free meal at this place! I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich at first which came on a stale dried out bun with some over cooked fried chicken. You could get a better chicken sandwich at KFC for 3 bucks (that's not even a joke). My replacement order was calamari which tasted like it's been sitting in a freezer for 6 months...like fish sticks that you forgot you had in you freezer and then decided to try eating them....I could taste the freezer burn. But the beer and the view were cool I guess.",negative
"It was convenience so I was giving it a try! The food was unexpectedly slow, from other reviews it looks like it's not a the first night with this problem. I hope the owner read the reviews and make some improvements if they want to continue running this business! For our table, it was over an hour wait for the food, it's disappointing. I ordered the wings, they said 1 lb, I got 8 tiny dried wings. I picked dry rub, I asked in advance if it will just be pepper and salt on top, the waitress said no it's Cajun rub, but when it arrived it's no Cajun, just salt and pepper which is what I didn't want. But should I say anything I won't get to eat dinner that night. My friend ordered ribs and chicken pot pie. They are nothing special, not great, didn't worth the price we paid. Will never come back. Rather go upstairs to Pearl, the Chinese restaurant, they have great food and services! If you really want the patio, bring your own food, it will be much better than this place! Also, we were in front of the DJ, it was very loud that we couldn't chat.",negative
"When you're told upfront you have to wait one hour to get served, at least you have an expectation. If two hours elapsed and no meal arrives it becomes unreasonable. Watermark however takes disrespecting it's customers to a fine art by not even providing a time for the meal after two hours. We cancelled our orders, but that was the least disconcerting aspect of our evening's experience. It was the evident callous and egregious lack of an explanation on the part of the manager Julie. We even paid for a glass of wine that was ordered a half an hour ago that wasn't served. Unbelievable!",negative
"Good food and great location. Would probably be better to come over the summer to enjoy the view and the pool. Of all the dishes we ordered, probably dessert was the best! I would give the dessert a 4 star rating. Otherwise in terms of just food it's more like 3 star.",negative
"Keep in mind its location. It is right on the water and you pay for rent. People watching is at its best here, of coarse if you're out on the patio. Food is ok at best. Keep the expensive liquor flowing and the experience gets better and better. As an added bonus, the pigeons have no fear...",negative
"With the exception that this place is located right by the water, and if you sit outside on their large patio and enjoy people watching...I can't really think what else this place has going for it. So while waiting to start our paddle boating tour, we decided to grab a quick bite to eat here. For some odd reason there was a line up to get in, even though we could clearly see there must have been at least 10 empty tables outside. When I inquired I was told by the hostess, ""well there are people ahead of you"". Yes I could see the line up of people ahead of me..waiting...waiting...for tables that were empty?? Anyways, at least the wait wasn't too long. Shown to our table we had prompt service from our server, who nicely warned us that since they were busy the food might take longer to come, in case we had to get somewhere soon. That was nice of him to warn us so we could order quickly. We ordered fish tacos and some of the dips/chips to munch on. The fish tacos (spicy) were not spicy. A baby would not find them spicy. They lacked taste and only tasted a little better when I put some lime on them. The chips/dips/pita bread were ok - but how can you really screw up that? Having decided that I must use the ladies room before leaving, I walked through the inside of the restaurant which was practically empty as most people wanted to sit outside (in fairness this place is HUGE so good for bigger groups) and found the washroom. Now to say I was shocked was a bit of an understatement. For a restaurant this large the women's washroom only had 2 stalls?? For a place that can easily hold a couple hundred of people I find this a bit unacceptable Line ups were forming. Besides the prime location I can't really see what this place has going for it. So if you want to come here for the view, by all means do but don't expect much otherwise",negative
Don't waste your time. Waited around at our table for over ten minutes while servers wandered around in no rush. Weren't even busy. Gave up and left.,negative
"Brought a group here for an ESL tour that I'm running. I wasn't overly impressed last time, but we thought that the location was right and we wanted to sit on a patio. I called several days ahead to make a reservation for 8 people.I guess business was slow and it was too cold because by the time we finished the tour the patio was closed. We were fine to sit inside as many of us were cold. The service was even more so. I'm not sure if the server was snippy and rude off the bat because he thought the he was going to get stiffed from a bunch of foreigners, but I made a specific point of telling our students that the normal tip amount is 15%. With the attitude we received, I should have told them to leave nothing, but I'm trying to give these students and language and culture lesson, so customs are important. The minute we sat down he acted like we were going to be a total pain in the ass. He loudly yelled ""So I expect that most groups like this want separate checks, do you guys need separate checks?"" His words were not as biting but his attitude was that of someone who was completely put out by us and our perceived needs. I politely told him that separate checks would be helpful. Then he proceeded to yell out ""Just to let you now, I can definitely DO the separate checks, but you guys can't move around and order stuff and switch seats because that will definitely slow me down and you'll have to wait longer for your checks."" Spare us the freaking warning. These are adult ESL students-- not children and we have no plans to play musical chairs. If fact, most of the staff who were working were very unwelcoming and not very happy. To be fair, the guy who served us on the patio earlier, when we were meeting up, was efficient. A bit frazzled, but at least we got our drinks without the attitude. I get that patios are a pain in the ass. I'm a server, too and I understand how frustrating the job can be, but if you don't like tourists and foreigners, you shouldn't be working at a pub on the waterfront. The food was ok. Separate bills were accurate, but they really need to work on the attitude of the staff because most of them seem miserable.",negative
"With its incredible scenic views and prime location along the waterway, The Watermark should be a leader in the upscale pub market for Toronto and a great place for good food and drink. Especially during the summer when the weather warms, the patio offers a perfect combination of heat and cool all at once. The reality of it is though, it's a average pub at best. I have been here a few times, and the first two times it was satisfactory. Nothing out of this universe, but the food was good and the service was decent. But today I think was enough to most likely make this visit my last. The service has never been the quickest, but the first two times I'd gone it doesn't stick out in my memory as slow. Today was terrible. We showed up as it was still fairly busy and got into line to wait for the patio. The server who was handling the line didn't even talk to us until about 15 minutes into our wait. No ""Apologies for the wait"" or ""Sorry, we're a bit understaffed today"". Not a big deal, but it does help the wait seem more tolerable when you know there's progress being made. After about 30 minutes in line (not that long of a line either), we are seated. One menu for three of us. Server says she'll look for more menus but she never returns with them. We sit there for 20 minutes without anyone coming to see us. Finally (and I hate doing this as I know it can come across as rude) I flag down a waiter and ask if they'll validate parking as me and my friends are considering leaving to go someplace else. The manager hears that we've been waiting almost an hour with no service and says the first round's on the house. Nice gesture, but the beers still take about 15 minutes to get there. We order our food. That takes about 25-30 minutes to get to our table. Friends order the Reuben sandwich which comes with two (not a typo) slices of meat on thick sourdough bread and very little slaw. I order the Fish and Chips, it arrives slightly cold and the chips are dripping with grease. Normally not something I'd care about because it's fish and chips, but it's still excessive. We order a second round, that takes another 10-15 minutes. By now the patio has emptied considerably and there's no reason for this much of a lag. We don't tip (and I always tip). Overall a terrible experience. An explanation would have gone a long way to making us understand, but it wasn't there. Not worth the trip",negative
Such A Shame! So sad that somewhere with such a great location always seems to drop the ball. If you are going for food you need to realize they share a kitchen with the restaurant next door a lot of items are made in bulk (as I found out with our brunch eggs Benedict and eggs) Service is horrible. Only once while sitting at the outdoor bar have I had good service. One visit we were actual forgotten. Empty plates in front of us for 40 minutes no server in sight had to literally hunt her down and when she brings the bill no explanation. They really need to get their act together because there is potential.,negative
"Stopped in for a drink before going on a harbor cruise, was not really impressed. They didn't even have Guinness on tap! They may have had a total of three Irish beers on the menu. The food was a bit more Irish, but we didn't order anything, so I can't speak on that. Service was decent. View was nice, right on the water.",negative
The atmosphere is nice considering this is on the lake but the food is always....just ok. I want to love it but feel like they can do so much better. The staff is always pleasant which helps but if they ramped up their food quality they would get more of us locals.,negative
"We have been at this pub before and we liked the location so decided to come back, but since it was a saturday night there was a wait so I put my name on the waiting list and I was told that the waiting for the table is 20mins and then once we get a table its gonna be another 20mins to order and then to get the food is another 40mins. So we were ok with it as we can order some drinks while waiting and we already had planned of going to this pub, take note we were only 4 people. So after 15-20 mins we got a message saying we have been removed from the waiting list, so we walked towards the pub to ask the hostess ;who is by the way is not so sure of what she is doing, to ask if the table is ready. So she tells me ""I thought you got a table already""; so I told her that we just got a message so we just came back. And then she tells me its because the kitchen is close already. So I told her the whole story of how she told me what the waiting time is and we agreed to wait; but then she just gave me this stare and replies ""sorry the kitchen is closed"". So first of all why would you write my name on the waiting list and then tell us the kitchen is close and why would she assume that we got our table already cause I thought that was her job. So after seeing her i-dont-know-what-to-say look. I just said that's fine and we left. My friends wanted to talk to the manager but we decided not to as it will not make our day any better after all that, we were just gonna beg for a table which I think should not be the case. Anyways, might not come back or I just hope its gonna be better this time. If you cannot accommodate customers don't waste their time.",negative
"Great service! I've been here twice and the staff is funny and friendly. I love the view from the patio. This place is great for friends or on a date. Menu as both light and heavy options which is great (ex. sandwiches and burgers and veggie burgers, house salad and beef salad). One star off because there's usually a line up, and because the food is a bit pricey (Lobster sandwich is about $16.00).",positive
"First of all, if you want to drink and be around friendly staff, this place is great. BUT, I live across the street at a harbourfront condo and let me tell you, some of the food experiences here are like they have 14 year olds in the kitchen. Example CONS: - Sunday Brunch, my girlfriend's eggs benedict had no yolk! They were overcooked. - The previous Lobster Club on the menu had to be one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. - Under and Overcooked Burgers. They go from red/pink to hockey pucks, I guess it depends on the attention span or anxiousness of the cook? This food doesn't even compare at all to it's chain of restaurants from Brazen Head to the others. Such a poor food experience for such a great tourist location. Step it up. Chris @ Queens Quay",negative
"Wow! What a great view, but what an awful meal! Three of us ordered the Buffalo chicken fingers. Really, I believed this was the type of meal no pub could screw up. But I was wrong. The fries were stone cold. After one bite, we could tell that they were made hours ago and had been reheated in the microwave. That is just plain lame. When I told the server about the fries, she didn't seem remotely surprised, indicating to me that she knew from the start that they were foul. She offered to bring a basket of new fries which she did fairly quickly. But it was a very small order which we shared between the three of us. She did offer to bring us another basket, but by then it was far too late, we were packing up to leave. The chicken fingers also were a bit sketchy and sat in my stomach like greasy rocks. And the coleslaw was a sorry pile of nearly naked cabbage. For $15, this meal was a mess. Without getting too graphic, let's just say that I am afraid to stray too far from the house because I may be running back to the loo again. Foul.",negative
"I had kind of a horrible experience here and it was mostly thanks to the waitress. We found ourselves at Watermark following an exciting Jay's game where we consumed a good amount of salted peanuts! Naturally I was dying of thirst, so between the arrival of our drinks and ordering food I went to the bar to request a quick glass of water! This may have been the triggering point which unreasonably led to our waiter blatantly skipping me when taking orders on several occasions, getting my order wrong, and adding extra items to my bill. A little extreme in my view, but hey maybe it was a horrible Friday night. As for the food the Ontario Beef Burger isn't very special (again, could have just been mine), but oddly enough the Crunch burger tasted great. Nothing extraordinary to write about other nibblers as it's just typical pub food. All in all, Watermark has one hell of a location, which I guess means it doesn't have to try hard when it comes to pleasing the customers (especially when the tip is slapped on for groups). I'd probably avoid it, save the happy hour or other exceptional circumstances.",negative
"ok so I just read the review below and it's not just us who experienced a very slow and inattentive service. we were told that the server is on training but being on training doesn't mean being rude. rolling eyes at our requests, bringing wrong orders(multiple times) after we wait for 1hr and all that without a slightest attempt to apologize. One apology and I would be satisfied. Overpriced but that's due to locations. Honestly, I'd prefer to go to a second cup nearby with the same amazing view and self service and cheap prices. ah also - no options for vegetarians except few appetizers - sweet fries, regular fries and one salad. would give it another chance if I wasn't so annoyed by the service.",negative
"It's my 2nd time at this restaurant, both times for breakfast / brunch and both times I experienced the same problem with slow and rude customer service. Based on the reviews I see here, it doesn't look like it was a case of bad luck for me. Last year, when we came, the waitress was slow in seating us, bringing out our beverages, taking our orders and serving our orders. She actually had the decency to slam the water glasses on the table. There was next to no one on the patio and yet, we were ignored while all the waitresses socialized with each other at the bar. Asked to speak to the manager and he didn't care too much about the situation. Came back here again this year because we were staying at the Radisson Admiral and it was one of the closest places to grab breakfast. Once again, there were only a handful of occupied tables on the patio. Our waitress came us 2 pitchers of water immediately but did not return with cups until 15 minutes later. She took drink orders one at a time and did not return with them until 5 minutes later. They were on a reduced menu and offered only 3 items for breakfast - 1 of which were belgian waffles. We ordered the belgian waffles and then were told that they had run out. Most of us ordered the same dish (bacon, sausages, eggs) given the limited choices. Our food came about 1 hour later!!! I can understand 1 hour if I was asking for a more creative and extravagant dish. However, 1 hour to make eggs, sausages and toast is ridiculous. Not only, we saw guests who arrived after us order, eat and leave before everyone at our table had their meals! Of the 2 hours spent at the restaurant, I'm confident in saying that I spent 1 hour looking at the bar waiting to be acknowledged by the waitstaff. Extremely frustrated, I asked to speak to the manager and at least he seemed to care enough to offer us a discount on our bill in exchange for the ""inconvenience"". To be honest, I don't care for the discount because my time is worth more than the couple of dollars that he took off the bill - I just wanted to make sure that he received feedback that the level of customer service or lack thereof was utterly disgusting. In a profession where 18% gratuity is becoming the standard, I expect better. The average person who works has performance reviews and only receive bonus and raises if their performance meets or exceeds expectations so why should waiters and waitresses be any different?",negative
"It's all about the patio, but barely ... *1.5 stars. If you decide to visit Watermark, before you leave, ask them to post a picture of you at the entrance with a sign reading, ""Please punch me in the face if you see me again."" I wish I had. Do not go for the food. Do not go for the service. Prepare to overpay. The breeze off the lake was nice.",negative
"This place was so unmemorable that I didn't even remember the name until I stumbled upon some pictures while searching for good eats at the Harbourfront. I went there on a blind date - not wanting to seem like a picky eater, I quickly settled on Watermark after a walk along the harbour figuring that you can't go wrong with pub food. Ultimately, this was true - I can't complain about the food but it was definitely nothing to write home about either. It was a Sunday night in early July so there was quite a large crowd clamouring for a seat on the patio. We decided to wait at the bar which was so crowded that it was almost impossible to find a space to order a drink. My date didn't have any cash on him either at which point I quietly expressed that I'm an indoors kind of gal so sitting inside was just fine by me. We were seated almost immediately. I wasn't too thrilled though - the tables are arranged in a very haphazard way and the space was quite dark. It definitely looked like there were some not-so-clean patches on the seats and floor. Again, not wanting to seem picky and demanding, I put aside my mildly-OCD tendencies and had a seat. We got the calamari to start (he chose, I'm not really one for calamari at a pub) and both got the buffalo chicken tenders with blue cheese dip and Yukon potato fries. The calamari came out fast enough and was a huge portion - great for sharing. Then began the waiting portion of the meal - good thing we were able to carry on a conversation easily as we waited and waited .. and waited some more. My date politely asked the waiter when we could expect our food. It came out shortly after. It was fine. Nothing wrong with it - satisfactory chicken fingers, satisfactory portion, good dip. All in all, an average pub with slightly-above-average prices due to location.",negative
"I came here for lunch, my friend and I waited to be seated but were waiting for like 10 min before we were escorted to our table . The view is nice except there is a big boat docked there blocking the view so not much of a view I guess, the Server was ok brought us our beers on time we ordered the lobster club sandwiches which was very good he asked us if we wanted it a salad with it instead of fries so my friend asked for the salad which according to her was good but then when we got the check he charged us $2 for it although he didn't mention that in the beginning . Also when he brought the food there weren't any utensils so we had to wait like 5 min for him Bring some . The place looks very sloppy and unorganized I would go there again for a beer or so but if ur looking for an experience then this is not the place for you .",negative
"Location! Location! Location! Tourist Trap! This place thrives and still exists because of it's location to the harbor. There is really nothing to say about this place. Take the most average service, combine it with pre-frozen dishes, and add a dash of predictability and you have Watermark: the most generic forgettable pub/restaurant.",negative
"I'm giving Watermark 2 stars rather than 1 for the location and design. This pub has a nice atmosphere and design; I love the garage door windows. If you get a seat outside during the summer you'll have a great view of the waterfront. However, if you chose to dine at Watermark you'll have loads of time to admire the design and waterfront while waiting for service. I went with a party of 8 to have brunch at the pub and we waited nearly an hour for food! I hate when staff at a restaurant use the excuse that a big party means longer wait for food (which they did). I took a Chef Training course and it's not that difficult to get 8 meals out at the same time if you have a well managed kitchen. It's especially not difficult when it's the exact same meal. We all ordered the Irish Breakfast; eggs, bacon and toast can be made in 10 minutes so an hour wait is just ridiculous. As for the meal itself it was pretty standard. The menu stated 3 eggs we're used in the breakfast but the actual portion couldn't have been more than 1 egg. The bacon was stuck together and cooked unevenly, as a result of throwing bacon that was frozen together right onto the grill. It seems petty to complain about eggs and bacon but that's a pretty standard breakfast dish everyone learns to cook at one point in their life. You crack an egg in a hot pan, wait a couple minutes and voilà! Breakfast. Our waitress wasn't very apologetic and other reviews mention slow service so it must be a given with this restaurant. It's a nice pub visually so hopefully it gets taken over by new management.",negative
Had lunch today with a friend. Really enjoyed this restaurant. It was established in 1842. It was a nice day today they did serve on the back deck. We decided to eat in one of the dining rooms. I started with a small chopped salad with their house oregano vinaigrette dressing it was excellent. They also gave us a bread basket. For my meal I had their liver with onions and bacon served with mashed potatoes and green beans. If you love liver be sure to try theirs. A friend had a crock of French onion soup that look excellent. He also had their Braised beef & wild mushroom stroganoff. It also looked excellent. They have fresh perch and walleye which should be a great lunch choice.j Friendly staff. Really clean restrooms. A big parking lot.,positive
"We have dined at the Welshfield Inn many times. Though I consider it a bit overpriced, we've always found the service & food to be very good until today. Perhaps management had not planned for the Easter Sunday crowd but, considering reservations were required, I find that implausible. We were promptly seated & our server was attentive throughout our visit but the food & price points left much to be desired. Our meals took about 35 minutes to be served. Since our server was reliably visiting our table to refill our beverages, I lay blame on the kitchen. I ordered brunch which consisted of 3 eggs, 2 sausage links, home fries, 1 slice of toast, & a small fruit cup. Both the homefries & sausage were served lukewarm. My wife ordered scallops & mashed potatoes. She received 3 small scallops for $38 which, in my opinion, should be considered robbery. Is the Welshfield Inn becoming complacent as one of the area's few fine dining establishments? Were they overwhelmed by the holiday? Is it a different management team on Sunday afternoons than it is during our past visits on Friday & Saturday evenings? I wish I knew. But this experience has me hesitant to return. __________ If you have read my review to this point, please help keep me motivated by casting your vote. Thank you in advance.",negative
"We love this place! It's a great place for a date night! We are frequent flyers especially on Thursday nights. They offer a 2 for $40 which includes an appetizer, 2 entrées and a bottle of wine. The salmon and risotto entrée and is amazing! We love the calamari and brushetta appetizers and the french onion and mushroom bisque soups! The staff is super friendly every time we are there. We love the live music in the dining room. The decor is rustic and beautiful. We can't wait to try out the patio in the summer! This place is a must if you are in the area!",positive
"Loved it here and will go back. The atmosphere, staff and food were great. Everyone in our group enjoyed their dinners and had a wonderful time.",positive
Why we went again was not my choice don't ask me but my wife wanted to go to welshfield Inn so we did. And for the i hope last time I ordered your special pork loin it was supposed to come with stuffing and gravy when I arrived there was no stuffing no gravy and it was so dry it was like hard . They used to have nice rolls.today rhey were stale and served cold..stay away is places gone down the hill.you hate to complain because it is embarrasing.,negative
"Very disappointed with the food, I ordered the chicken parmesan and it looked very promising. However, after the first few bites I realized the chicken was very bland and burnt. I have to say, McDonalds has more flavor than my dish.",negative
"This place is best for lunch. Dinner is far overpriced for the caliber of comfort food offered. They got rid of the chicken pot pie..which was, I must say, quite impressive, and substituted this odd tasting short rib pot pie. In this, the scant pieces of rib are ruined by the red sauce which DOES NOT WORK and should be reserved for a stuffed cabbage/pepper based dish if you were to filch from gramma's cookbook. A minimalist schnitzel rounded out our dinner which my wife ""wafted"" all night long. Nice place. Good service. Friendly people. Again, lunch good. Dinner....meh.",negative
"Wonderful food and service. I had Welshfield rarebit -- melted cheese sauce with lobster on sourdough bread. Asparagus side. Heavenly. Others at our table had Stroganoff, schnitzel, crispy chicken sandwich. Everyone loved their entree. Nice basket of rolls too. Will go again and again. We went there again for my birthday dinner and found it just as good as the first time. I had two glasses of Benziger Cabernet and it was superb. Filet for an entree, also excellent, and Gary had pork schnitzel, also very good. Only complaint is stale rolls and odd to get cinnamon rolls for dinner. Upping stars to five. What a find!",positive
"This is my go to place the past few years. I have never had a bad meal and I absolutely love the short ribs and salmon. Ok, the Mack and cheese is pretty delicious to. Good specials so watch for them.",positive
"After coming from Great Lake cheese factory we were looking for somewhere to eat. With little to no options we stumbled into this restaurant. I had the onion soup, Caesar salad and sandwich of the day (some sort of French roast). Needless to say we were very pleased. The service was great and the food was amazing!",positive
"Amazing find! The most lovely staff, creative menu and country sophisticated ambiance! Perfect locale for a cozy date night! Start with a cocktail in the bar and then head into one of 3 dining rooms for a lovely dining experience. A huge thumbs up for Cleveland's east side dining crowd!",positive
What a wonderful family dinner. Felt like we were at our own dinning room table. Except we just got to sit and be served. Rebecca was own young pretty server she made our time so enjoyable. We will be there next a Thanksgiving and sooner.,positive
Scary place to eat if you are a vegetarian. Sent my chopped salad back 3 times to take off meat an egg. It was embarrassing because it was an event that was planned for me there. Well I am going to try it one more time then leave it behind. What a shame,negative
"I will make this clambake a regular fall event. Rustic clambake meets traditional restaurant service. The decor is festive. Set under a tent but heated AND a large screen tv with the football game on which my husband appreciated. Your choice of lobster, steak or chicken. I had the chicken- large portion and moist. My friends had the steak and lobster and they enjoyed their choices. Best clam chowder I have ever had at a clambake. I don't eat clams or mussels but my husband said they were great. All you can eat soup and mussels the first hour. Plenty of sides. Make reservations early. Last year I called too late and they were booked all weekends. Finally, I didn't expect dessert but they served a delicious pumpkin roll. Service",positive
Drove in from Akron for some kayaking on the Cuyahoga and lucked into this oasis for lunch. Food was fantastic. Outdoor setting was literally like a country club... Beautifully manicured. Service was also great. Highly recommended...,positive
"Wonderful, perfectly seasoned comfort food and drinks, friendly service, great atmosphere..can't ask for better! We will be back!",positive
"I finally got here after wanting to do so for several years but it just never seemed to happen. It is delightful - beautiful building and really, really nice staff. There were four of us and we were seated promptly and politely. Couldn't believe it when I saw liver on the menu which I know isn't what many people like but I love it. Cooked to absolute perfection. The rest of our party were as happy with the choice as me. My only complaint and it is minor is that I ordered iced tea and was never asked if I would like a refill while those who had coffee were refilled several times.",positive
"Beautiful outdoor seating, deeeeeelish cinnamon rolls, excellent meal and very attentive and friendly staff. One of my favorite restaurants.",positive
"Nice place. Casual enough to take the family, excellent food, good service and the best cinnamon buns i have had. Get their advice before choosing your entre. Met the owner a couple of weeks ago and he said the cinnamon buns are even better now.",positive
"We have been here many times and usually love it. The chicken chopped salad has always been my favorite. However, we went Tuesday night (not a very busy night) and were very disappointed! My husband ordered the chicken pot pie and said it was not any better than the $1.99 Swansons you can get in the grocery store. I had the chicken chopped salad and the chicken had a distinctive fish taste. I had everyone else at the table take a bite and everyone agreed. I told our waitress, she took it back and they offered my a free dessert, which I accepted because I was HUNGRY. They did not take the salad off the bill. I'm not sure what happened that night, hopefully it was just an off night. We take out of town business associates there for lunch or dinner quite often and we are re-thinking that right now.",negative
I always love this place. The menu is great and the atmosphere is cozy and the exterior looks like something you would find in the south. I would recommend coming in the warmer months and sitting on the back patio. It is very pretty. We actually take our kids here too for a nice meal.,positive
"Started with the zucchini haystack, great then had the Pork Shank and ended with the delicious gingerbread desert. Definetly would come back here.",positive
"My wife and I frequently have lunch here after spending time at the Burton Antique Show. We have always had a good meal and friendly, professional service. Saturday, 09/27/14, was no exception. I had the 'Shrimp and (cheesy) Grits'...wha?? Yes, sounds ""unusual"" but it was very flavorful. Would have liked more shrimp but actually the grits and other ingredients made up for it. What a unique combination of flavors. Really different. My wife had the 'Slowly Braised Pot Roast.' Absolutely perfectly cooked tender beef, pan gravy and mashed potatoes. I don't think my grandmother could have made it better and she was a GREAT cook. Our server was busy but he always kept our glasses full and checked with us just often enough to meet our needs. We ate inside and have also dined on the beautiful patio in the past. In six or seven times dining here we have always had a very pleasant experience. Sorry to read that some customers did not. K&G, Bay Village, OH",positive
"This restaurant has come under new ownership, which apparently has made the Inn suffer from poor management and organizational issues. While I wish I could rate this restaurant entirely based on its menu, unfortunately, the disorganization behind what the management did to my family yesterday is inexcusable and, frankly, important to bring up to would-be patrons of this establishment. Weeks ago, my family carefully made a reservation to eat here on Easter, an understandably very busy time. My mother even requested that they please reserve the table by the window, so my elderly grandmother could look out at the garden view she so enjoys. When my family showed up with my 90-something grandmother at the time of their reservation, they were informed that the reservation had been ""lost"" and there was nothing that the management could do to help my family. Imagine trying to find somewhere else to eat on such short notice on Sunday Easter! The least the management could have done was offered a gift certificate or something to make it up to my Grandma, who, by the way, came all the way out there in her wheelchair. Eventually, the only offering they made was to stick them in the ""party room,"" which is the annex building next door where cheaper and far less palatable food was being served buffet-style and people were forced to sit at long, picnic-style tables. My grandmother, in a wheelchair, mind you. She isn't even strong enough to lift herself from her chair any more! I will happily update and change this review when my family has been appropriately compensated for the poor way this whole incident was handled. Any gesture at all would go a long way toward showing some modicum of respect toward my poor Grandma who used to be their most devoted patron when it was under the former ownership (she ate dinner there nearly every day when my grandfather was alive)!",negative
Great restaurant in a converted century home setting I've only stopped in for lunch never dinner. I've have always been greeted at the door and the friendly staff always provided exceptional service. The place is all white cloth covered tables and is very nostalgic. They always have great lunch specials and the chef does an outstanding job with his food presentations. The portions and prices are a little high for the area but they deliver on quality. Lunch time the place is always filled with business people and it can accommodate small party for club meetings and there is always good amount of elderly people dressed nice and enjoying the atmosphere around a cozy fire or out on the patio weather permitting. This was always my go to spot for business lunches in the area and everyone always enjoyed the time spent here. There is a small bar area that is great for afternoon cocktails plenty of parking and easy access off of Route 422. I don't think you will ever be disappointed making this choice I would highly recommend giving them a try.,positive
"We have returned again and again to the Welshfield Inn, because it's different, classy, accessible, warm, historic, and always has great food. Last night, we took advantage of the specials - prime rib (huge, meaty-not-fatty portion) and tenderloin and scampi combo. Both would cost double at Fleming's. The basket of homemade rolls, including cinnamon buns, is a nice touch. The Welshfield Inn's chopped salad is always a good idea - not too dressed and full of fresh ingredients. In the past, our daughter loved the chicken pot pie. She pronounced it better than she'd had anywhere. Our waitress cared if everything tasted OK - and, of course, it did! Four dollar Long Island Iced Teas were the cherry on top. Can't beat the Welshfield Inn!",positive
We were there last winter and it just keep getting better ! ! We and the other couple both got the 2 for $40 Thursday special. Each of us got a different meal and all were excellent. My Braised Pork Shanks were a winner. Service was great. I'll be back there in a week for a Birthday celebration and I can't wait for another great meal !,positive
"I've been here on several occasions and have found exceptional service and great food at each visit. The restaurant is so cozy, with fireplaces and beautiful woodwork. The dining areas are sectioned off like rooms in an old house so your dining experience is much more intimate. We had our wedding reception at the Welshfield Inn Banquet Center. Kathy was extremely helpful through the whole process. The reception was amazing. The staff was uber helpful. They actually seemed to be enjoying themselves. (Whether or not they were faking it is irrelevant!!!) We got a lot of compliments on the food from our guests. I was expecting the food to be less tasty than the food you are served when you are in the restaurant since they were cooking for a large group, but that was not the case. It was awesome! They even made us a few dishes not on their menu!!! I really felt as if I just said ""This is what I want: blah, blah, blah"" and when I showed up, everything was exactly the way I pictured it. Some of the wedding party and guests mentioned some really helpful things the staff did for them. The prices here are very reasonable for the service, atmosphere and quality you get. It was much less expensive than other places we looked at in Ohio. I don't even want to guess how much a wedding like this would cost where I live. The Welshfield Inn and the awesome staff on hand helped make this the best day of our lives.",positive
We just were at the Welshfield Inn this past weekend for a rehearsal dinner and the food was fabulous. The service was great and the atmosphere is very charming. This is pretty much in the middle of nowhere Ohio. As you look around outside you will see modern cars as well as horse and buggy's since you are in the largest Amish community in the world (fun fact for everyone. I am sure you were all dying to know that). The menu had a list of 5 meals all with sides to choose from. I choose the Chicken Picatta with asparagus and rice It was all cooked in a nice white wine sauce that was to die for. My husband got the pasta dish they offer and he said it was great as well just a very big portion. I had a few bites and it was quite good. The sauce was not overpowering but they include tons of fresh vegetables with the pasta. Overall it was a good dinner experience at a place I would have probably never visited on my own.,positive
Made our first stop there today for burgers. They were very well done though we requested medium rare. It turned out very dry. Looked over the menu to see the prices are much higher than before. don't think I'd give them another go if they can't make a simple burger right.,negative
This place is good the AZ burrito is good. Think of this place as a less expensive Los Favoritos. I would Definitely recommend this place to friend.,positive
Been coming here for a while now! Love this place very clean custom service is great. They know me by name. Food is so delicious only Mexican restaurant I eat at!!!!,positive
"My favorite go to Mexican food place! Affordable, quick, and delicious! Their chicken taco, cheese quesadilla, and chips with salsa are my personal favorites!",positive
Love their food. Love their green salsa. Quick and always seem to be open which is nice. I always get the simple stuff which is a bean and cheese burrito and it never fails on being good. Their rice is just perfect too. They are always super quick.,positive
"This is the first time coming into your business! I had a taco/ enchiladas combo. The service was quick and the food was fantastic! After words I went in to use the restroom, it was very clean. I will be returning to this fantastic business.",positive
"We had a few different things here on our first visit: 2 breakfast burritos: bacon, egg, bean, & cheese AND a chorizo, bacon, been and cheese. Both where excellent. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the salsa had a strange taste. They had a steady flow of people coming in on a early Sunday afternoon. The dining area was very clean and the young lady that took our order was very pleasant. Next time I'll use my own hot sauce/ salsa.",positive
"I walked in to place an order, no others in line. The phone rings after I get in line. The guy walks out of the back and picks up be phone takes an order. Then he gives an order to a waiting customer. The phone rings again, he picks it up (apologizes) and takes another order. Now I place my order. You would think he knows how to put someone on hold for a minute. For gods sake, there is a live person in your restaurant before the phone rings.",negative
Excellent customer service. I had a shredded beef taco and bean and cheese burrito (my usual). They had lots of cheese and lettuce on the taco. Burrito was great. Glad they are fairly close to my house! Restaurant was clean. I will be back!,positive
"Honestly, the best ground beef burrito I have ever had! I crave it! Service is always good and the prices are more than reasonable! Love this place",positive
"All I'm going to say is ""true Mexican food!"" This place is delicious. It's not fancy by any means but that's the magic behind this place. A hole in the wall restaurant where the food speaks for itself. The employees are friendly as well. If you want a taste of Mexico, then come here!",positive
"Best hole in the wall Mexican food in the area. I've tried a couple of things but the chicken tacos are my favorite - crunchy shells stuffed with savory chicken. The rice is also especially tasty, I like that they add a little veggies to jazz it up.",positive
"Don't believe the hours they post. I showed up here at 945pm to get a meal for the first time and they had the doors locked. There was a lady at the cash register and when I knocked on the door, she didn't even acknowledge my presence. After I kept knocking, she looked up, looked back down and kept at whatever she was doing. If this is how y'all treat customers, I'm glad I didn't try your food. Complete trash customer service. Smh.",negative
"Yuliana's has the best breakfast burritos in Gilbert after my long lost search for a decent breakfast burrito my search finally came to an end after finding Yuliana's. This place is a total hole in the wall tucked away in a stripmall that I have passed several times and never noticed. Prices here are great, service is quick, menu is decent and place is clean not much more you can ask for.",positive
"Yulianas is a convenient place to do take out and I believe most people choose to do take out. They do have booths to eat at if you would like to take your food to a table and eat. I don't believe they provide complimentary chips and salsa, but that's ok since we hardly ever eat there. In general, they food is pretty good and the prices are average. Of the many times we've gotten food from here, there was only one time that they slightly messed up the order by charging me for extra tortillas but forgetting to put them in the bag (it happens). If you're looking to take home some Mexican Food tonight and live nearby, this place is an acceptable option.",negative
"6:20am on a Sunday morning is not the best time to find a place open in Mesa for breakfast. I'm shine my elation when I found a four star reviewed Mexican place that was not only open but not too far out of my way to pick up a delicious breakfast burrito. On arrival the place looked a little dark. I was hoping that was for atmosphere. I was actually feeling a bit excited at the prospect of a new place I haven't eaten at and my stomach was growling in anticipation of some fluffy eggs, salty bacon, melty cheddar cheese, and salsa all wrapped up in a warm flour tortilla. Unfortunately someone forgot to get up on time and failed to open this morning. I would have allowed 5-10 minutes late. Stuff happens. But almost a half hour late? No pass given.",negative
"Pretty disappointing. No Bueno & no salsa bar or hot carrots! Prices do seem reasonable. I can sure say ; ""Looked better than it tasted"". Tacos ( chicken & beef) bland in flavor. They offer two salsas in containers: a green which is ok & a red that taste of the plastic bottles it's squeezed from. Refried beans good ( I'm sure they're made with lard) LOL The rice was just plan average. Bathroom ( unisex) is filthy! I tried this spot, won't be back.",negative
"Amazing!!! This food chain is compatible to filibertos and los favorites HOWEVER, the freshness of their ingredients is incomparable. Delicious Mexican food!",positive
Moving from SoCal to Florence I was disappointed with our Mexican food choices... until I found Yuliana's! Sooooo yummy!!!,positive
I love their carne asada fries and my daughter their quesadillas. We also love their horchata we are very picky with horchata.,positive
We moved across the street last year and we're so glad we found this place! Price is great for the amount of food that you get,positive
"We just saw this and stopped in for a quick and last minute Dinner instead of going home and cooking and I have to tell you, that we did not got disappointed. Really good food, nice lady and very clean restaurant.",positive
We have now been here on multiple occasions and have loved everything we've ordered. Their breakfast burritos are delicious and can feed more than 1 person. My favorite has been the quesadilla supreme. The carne asada is flavorful and the addition of the beans inside makes it a complete meal. Highly recommend!,positive
"Food quality is 4 stars. Tortillas are 5 stars, but for the price they get an overall 5th star. Great family operation. We had the breakfast burritos and a shredded chicken burrito.",positive
"Let's call this what it is, a dive restaurant. And yet it probably the closest thing to Mexican food in SE Gilbert. It's not Chipotle, Costa Vida or Rio so don't expect that. What you can expect is Mexican food that is good, reasonably priced and good.",positive
"I moved to the area recently and have been looking for real Mexican food. I frequent Costa Vida and Cafe Rio, but sometimes need the real deal. I was so excited when I found this place. The tacos were delicious and had a lot of meat! I was impressed. Service was quick and friendly.",positive
"Best Mexican fast food place around. Their hot sauce is the best you will find and hot!!! For breakfast ask for the egg, bacon and potato with cheese burrito. Promise you will have one every week!!",positive
"Not the best, not the worst. My husband got the cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside was not even melted, pretty disappointing. I got the rolled tacos and they were good. As usual with most of these places the beans and rice are in need of seasoning, and the salsa is mostly spice and not much flavor. The chips however are excellent!",negative
We go here at least once a week. Best Mexican food we have found in along time! Customer service and food is always top notch. Love this place!,positive
"I stop by here on my way home from work and I really do enjoy the food and hospitality! The prices aren't bad either, also I really enjoy the hospitality of this one gal whose always been there when I'm there and we've had great hospitality. Also I just want to mention their food tastes very fresh which makes the prices even more better! I will be continuing to stop by as long as I live in the area and so should other people!",positive
Great food but for takeout only. The inside is not much to look at. The food is delicious and authentic. A true gem for the area.,positive
"Ahh, Zeppes. I will give you 2 stars because you sent out a replacement order when our first order was problematic. Zeppes used to be great. I used to love their chicken parm....1 large succulent chicken breast, copious amount of sauce, lots of provolone, salad with lots of diced tomatoes and cheese with dressing, and 2 bread twists. Tonight I received 2 dried out, burned chicken tenders, dried out noodles with almost no sauce, hardly any cheese, no bread twists, no salad dressing, and a salad with a half cherry tomato cut in half and a sprinkling of cheese. What happened? The replacement order had the same dried out rubbery chicken strips but they weren't quite so black. It seems like you guys are cutting corners....with only increases in prices. Will not be returning.",negative
"As a first timer ordering Zeppe's, this was an awful first impression for a delivery to my home that is approximately 1 mile from this location. 16"", XL thin crust doubled over on itself after a lap around the Avon Nuremberg ring. We eat with our eyes first, and this experience was unpleasant upon reaching my tastebuds.",negative
"We were also staying at the Fairfield Inn, and we decided to get pizza at Zeppe's. Everything was amazing, but I would definitely recommend the calzones. I feel like the pizza crust has a unique pattern that gives the pizza a different look. In regards to our delivery man, I would say that he was very polite and was a few minutes early. I would like to say that eating Zeppe's pizza was very pleasant, and we will always remember it when we come back to Avon.",positive
"I was staying at the Fairfield Inn. Delivery was a few minutes early, the driver was polite. My order was hot and correct. They did not include a fork, which I thought they would since I am at a hotel, however I did not add it to the notes on my online order, so no harm. My boneless wings were delicious- tender and juicy, with just the right amount of sauce on them. My pizza was very good. Great amount of toppings evenly spread on it. It could have been cut a little better, as it seems the center of the pizza wasn't fully cut, but this was only a minor issue. Price was fair, maybe just a little expensive, for what was provided. I will order again!",positive
I drive 7 miles out of the way and past several other pizza places just to get pizza from avon zeppies. The staff is very friendly and polite.....that's the main reason I go there! Prices are reasonable. My order is always ready on time. Food is fresh and pizza is loaded end to end with toppings! The home made salted chips are one of my favorite items on the menu!!!,positive
Zeppe's used to be my go-to pizza place but recipe changes & new management has driven my business away for good. They changed to a thick cut pepperoni. Ick. Pizza pepperoni is supposed to compliment the cheese & crust perfectly. Their pepperoni is the only thing you taste on the pizza. Their prices are too high & you don't get nearly enough for your money. They get 2 stars because the teenager who took my order was so polite and tried very hard to be accommodating....until the owner took over. Bottom line: There are too many other great pizza places in the city to waste time on this one! Try Antonio's across the street by Marc's or Coleone's in downtown Avon.,negative
