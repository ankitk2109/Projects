Melissa took us on a tour of Asia in the space of a few hours. She definitely knows her history and regions. She takes the time to tell you about the different proprietors of the different restaurants that you stop at. She also lets you know about the different regions that each cuisine originates from. We would definitely take the other tours that are offered if time allowed. Make sure you arrive with an empty stomach...you'll need it.,positive
"With a group of seven of us visiting Montreal for the week, we were looking for a tour that would interest everyone in the group -- the chocolate tour was perfect. Who doesn't love chocolate?! Melissa was an awesome guide. We learnt a ton about chocolate making, and really enjoyed meeting the interesting people behind the chocolate businesses in Montreal. Plus, super-delicious chocolate tasting! I'd highly recommend this tour for chocolate lovers.",positive
"Melissa is a gem! My fianc√© found her tour on Viator and checked it out on Tripadvisor before we went. It is worth every penny. We took her Iberian walking tour of Montreal and it was filled with surprises (a chorizo distributor!) and great history. Lots of local stops, the tapa places were never something we would have discovered on our own. We had an intimate group of 4 on our tour (the other couple was from Australia). Great wines, great food and great company. I highly recommend it and will definitely take another tour with her when we return to Montreal.",positive
A perfect day in Montreal! Melissa outfitted us with bikes and then deftly guided us through the diverse neighborhoods of Montreal...and stopping along the way to sample amazing street food. Melissa was a delightful and knowledgeable guide. The food was terrific...from duck to sausages and naan-wiches to chocolate mousse. I would highly recommend Melissa and will consider another one of her tours when I am next in Montreal.,positive
"I had a really great food truck tour with Melissa through Montreal. She really loves and knows what she is doing (talking about food, Montreal,... ) and that is what make her tours so authentic and nice. You really hear a lot about Montreal and each food truck has its own story. Although the number of food trucks was limited on the day of the tour I still got more than enough food and the quality of the food was really good. Definitely not the typical fast food you would normally expect from food trucks more like haute cuisine on wheels. Montreal is a great city for cycling with a lot of bicycle lanes and only a few hills. Summing up I can only say that the tour was a real positive surprise and I would recommend the food truck tour to everyone who loves real food (not only fast food).",positive
"I did a food truck tour on bike here and had a wonderful guide named Melissa. She was very knowledgeable about her food, history of Montreal and very friendly. We had a bit of trouble getting our bikes at first as the company she uses never showed up (Ma Bicyclette) however she was very quick on her feet and decided to use Bixi bikes instead. While not ideal bikes, they did the job. Anywho, onto the tour itself, we explored a few areas and were able to try various food trucks such as: -Thai/Cambodian food -A crepe place -Au Pied du Cochon food truck -Dim sum + bubble tea -Belgian waffles The variety varies each time but what was great was that she had relationships with each of the food truck owners and you get to meet and chat with them. All in all, it's a great time. In addition, Melissa does a lot of other tours and you can't go wrong with her amazing personality and deep knowledge of the food industry, so just check her stuff out and see what suits you.",positive
"A very pleasant surprise. I have had triple a since 2003 but never have used the service. Just one of those ""in case"" something happens kinda things. Anyhow yesterday I went to my car and noticed my driver side door was open.I must of not closed it properly or some random person broke into my garage and opened my door. So it had been sitting in my garage for 3 days, The battery is completely dead (even the car locks activated? why does that happen?) So after sitting in the seat for a few minutes coming to the conclusion it was ME that did this I decided to do something. My first thought is I will call my friend for a jump. But it was 1:30 pm so he was likley sleeping. And then I remembered I had Triple A. Never actually thought much of them but I called. Within 40 minutes I was good to go. Triple A is worth it.",positive
"AAA is obviously a reputable company....That goes without saying, but they do employ a sales rep John Kolias that is as another yelper wrote a scam artist which I will agree with....He BS-ed me into a auto and condo insurance policy with promises of future discounts providing there were no claims and/or tickets, so when I followed up with him, he was a poop salesman with a mouth full of samples and I had to follow up with him on at least 4 occasions... He kept, saying I'll get you the discounts and call you back! He never did! I NEVER had any claims and subsequently I cancelled my policy! POOF money gone! Having said that, AAA is probably fine, but DON'T do business with John Kolias!",negative
The office is large with plenty of seating. Staff was alert and greeted me with a smile. Ralph is the best! He is no nonsense and extremely knowledgeable to get me in and out quickly with all my questions resolved. Truly a pleasure to do business with.,positive
"I just recently used my AAA roadside assistance for the first time even though I have had them for my car insurance and homeowners insurance for quite some time. The customer service that received was off the charts! The service was well beyond what I anticipated! They tracked my phone to pinpoint my location and gave me text messages to update the tow truck progress. I was told it would be about 45 minutes until the truck could get to me, this was at 3pm in the vegas heat of summer. I just knew it would be an hour and a half to 2 hours. At the 30 minute mark the dispatcher called to inform me the truck was about a mile and half away and was hurrying. My only response was a chuckle and a ""Wow"". That's Awesome! Even the driver was great... everytime he had to get in the car to turn the ignition or the wheel, he always sat on the door sil so he didn't get grease or dirt in the seat or on the interior of the car. When pulling the car up on to the bed of the truck with the winch, he was very steady with the controls and didn't jerk the car around at all. He treated my car with respect as if it was his own. I use the same shop for all my repairs, and they contacted me 20 minutes later to let me know my car had arrived and the driver treated my vehicle with the same care and respect even though I wasn't there. The Driver's name was Louis. That guy is an Awesome person! Thank you to him again... it's never a good reason when you have to contact your insurance company for any reason. However, Triple A made it as easy and comforting as possible. I'm glad I'm spending my money with a company that I can trust.",positive
Had a problem with my vehicle and stuck on the side of Blue Diamond at 9:00 pm. Within 90 minutes I had a truck there and hooked up on my way home. Juan was very courteous and first thing he did was offer me a bottle of cold water. He's a keeper AAA.,positive
JOHN KOLIAS IS A SCAM ARTIST!!!!! He signed me up for insurance with the promise of rewriting my policy after tickets fell off ... When In fact he straight lied to me and they never rewrite policy's until the end of a one year mark ... He than told me that my policy was paid in full until July witch was also a lie ... And now I have a cancellation notice and a bill due of 1181 ...with only a few days to pay .... He also told me to disregard the cancellation notice that he took care of it .. . Had I not taken this into my own hands I wouldn't have been covered not even known! BE AWARE !!! Do not go thru this office !,negative
"This review is of AAA in general, not a specific agent. Our car was hit in a local parking lot by a driver insured but AAA. He backed out of a parking space into the side of our car. The guy won't call AAA back so AAA will not process the claim. This guy and AAA are dragging their feet because after 30 days AAA can deny the claim and force us to use our insurance and pay a $400 deductible. AAA is a disreputable outfit charging high rates and gives poor service on claims. We are in our late sixties living on Social Security and are being taken advantage of by a rich insurance company. They don't care about old people or young ones for that matter. I had their insurance for years and when I moved to Nevada they wanted to triple my npremium! Nice. So, if you are thinking of getting AAA insurance, think twice and get other bids. The claim was settled after 5 weeks of giving proof the other driver was at fault and turning AAA into the State. I feel that they would not have accepted liability if the State had not inquired about the claim. This could be a real racket, waiting until the deadline hoping people will give up.",negative
I called last night and at first i had trouble getting someone to pin point my location since our tire blew out while we were on our way to las vegas and had no idea what exit we just passed. Then i was connected to someone that was able to help me out and i owe her a huge thanks for being amazing and having great customer service skills. She saved our trip since we decided to come down because my friend just graduated and she saved the night. I am glad i am a AAA member. I don't know if i am on the right AAA that she was working for but her name was Nicole. Many thanks Nicole. You saved our trip :),positive
"This review is for road side assistance. I called and spoke to a very respectable woman, as always. AAA roadside has always assisted me when I have locked my Keys in the car, needed a jump, or simply needed assistance on the side of the road. No matter what the city I'm in, from California to Nevada where I am now living, AAA has always sent out wonderful drivers to assist me. I have never had a problem with the service that they send to me along with the time it takes to arrive to me. Even if I'm in my friends car and we run out of gas, I know that I can rely on AAA. It's a wonderful service to have. I appreciate everything you do ! Thank you!",positive
"This is the second time I have had bad service and the second time leaving a bad review. I called the office to inquire about their travel services. I got a voicemail of course. I was contacted later that evening and she told me that if I was purchasing airline tickets that there is a $40 charge! I said ""well, just another reason to be dissatisfied with your services"". She replied ""it's not us, it's the airlines"". Then hung up on me. No goodbye or anything! WOW great customer service!! I think it's about time for a refund for what I was ripped off with this membership!! Absolutely NO stars!!!",negative
Been with AAA for almost two decades and I'm very satisfied with them! Jennifer our agent is awesome! She makes sure that we're taken care of! Thanks,positive
My wife and I wanted to show our grand-kids something that they have never seen or done. We went to our local AAA office and were greeted by a friendly and courteous professional who listened to what we wanted. She arranged both our lodging and all tours for the Grand Canyon and the train to and from the canyon. Everything went without a flaw. The accommodations were great and all the tours were just what we described to her. She was a true professional in this age of just getting by. Thanks AAA for taking a step above the rest and hiring the best people.,positive
"When we moved to the mainland 11 years ago, first thing we did was get a membership and boy was that a good deal. Over the years, we have had to use their services on more than one occasion. They have rescued me a few times, especially in the 100 degree temps we have here in Vegas. We also take advantage of the free travel information, like maps and tour books. We go a lot and love to investigate the places we're going before we get there. These maps and books help us do that. This is a must have service for anyone, where you travel or not, first time you need a tire change or tow, they'll come to your rescue and you'll understand why it's worth it!",positive
"I would give AAA Las Vegas claims office a negative star if I could, however, consider themselves lucky with one star. Three weeks ago my 2007 Toyota Prius was broken into and my daughters Disney Sleeping Beauty backpack was stolen. Damage to car broken window, window molding, paint on door etc..... Hours before this crime - I had called AAA to update my policy as my renewal policy declaration was incorrect. The determination of my deductability was in question as the loss occured on the same date as the updated policy. To make a long story short I was handed to ten AAA representatives over two painful weeks until the car was FINALLY approved for repairs. Next time I'll post a sign on my car ""Please don't break into this vehicle until after 24-48hrs from today as I am renewing my auto policy"". My auto premium would be better invested on training AAA customer service representatives and field appraisers. I did not feel I was a valued AAA member since 1986 and this was the 1st vandalism claim since being a AAA member. Is AAA turning into the IRS? Lame.................................",negative
I had some difficulty getting a membership card and login to the AAA website after transferring my membership from PA to AZ. After posting a bad review on YELP I was contacted by a customer relations person who took very good care of me. My real problem with the login was ME. I was able to print a membership card from the website with the proper expiration date.,positive
"I pay for the premiere services with AAA. Last night my vehicle needed to be towed home. I called at 10:17PM. I was given a time from of an hour wait time. An hour passes and still no updates! As I am about to call them, I receive a phone call stating the driver is dropping off an individual in Phoenix and I will be the next call! I was given the time frame of 40minutes. The time passes (over an hour) and still no updates and I have to call them back. I am now told I was given incorrect information and it will be another hour. Of course, that hour passes and still nothing. I call and get the same employee on the phone. She states ""I can't believe you are still waiting let me contact the dispatcher"". She puts me on hold for over 20 minutes and then hangs up on me. It is now after 1:30AM and I have to get a ride home and leave my vehicle! When I called to speak to a supervisor, they refused to come on the phone. Now, later this morning when calling them I was given the excuse that the call kept getting skipped for some reason. No apology no nothing. They acted like it was not a big deal! Unacceptable especially when I pay extra money for the premiere package and this is how I am treat UPDATE: A manager contacted me to apologize and discounted my upcoming renewal. I just hope in the future this doesn't happen again.",negative
"You must rate by stars in order to post, my one star is because they exist and answer the phone. My daughter stranded on the 10 freeway about 50 miles from Buckeye, 1st call no help, second call no help, called from 6 PM to 2 AM, several times they said they were on their way, I even called with my membership to get a second dispatch out, no service. The first call they said ""our tow truck driver has not eaten all day he has to go home for dinner"" and they never ever showed. My Premier/RV call for a 200 mile call never showed. Dispatch then sent out a CHP to check on her, still no tow truck, CHP took her to the nearest station about 10 miles from there and the CHP confirmed with AAA that they dropped her at the station (no car still on side of road) and AAA told her they would come get her at the station in 1 1/2 hours and still they did not show. My roommate headed out from California to get her, in the meantime a friend of hers came to her and used his Progressive insurance towing who showed up within an hour and they towed vehicle to station took the brand new tire that she had just purchased at Firestone one hour before her trip off the car to take back to stay in Phoenix until morning (car still stranded with three tires at station 50 miles from Phoenix)... I was on the phone from 8 PM til 1:45 AM, three way calling, hang ups, lost connections, etc STILL NO TOW TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The dispatch said they called the station and the person that answered said nobody was there, the CHP confirmed they dropped her, seriously, do you think a young woman booked a hike 50 miles at 11 PM back to phoenix.. My daughter spent two hours speaking to the 24 hour tire guy there at the shop and the restaurant owner there, she was there...They never tried to call my daughter on her cell, only mine, but she had her own call into them, they did nothing, nothing... insane! I can not tell you how frustrating this was, completely stressed out... Another time I was with my boat and nobody could help us either... this was horrific as well.... Bottom line, if you are in town with normal tire service or long distance tow, the tow trucks are happy to show, they make their money on the long distance, or quick tire change and short tows. But if you are stranded in the middle of nowhere and only have the classic tow, no tow truck company wants to get to you for that, or just for tire, they dont make their money. AAA Dispatch at one point told me they called 8 companies, how is this my problem????? I have AAA for a service, as a laison so to say.... it would not matter what the cost was, it cost us more than 400/500 dollars and 4 people to take care of this due to AAA telling us different stories.... NO TRUCK EVER CAME, many many calls and two different membership calls trying to get someone.. I was an employee for AAA for 8 yours in SO CAL and always have received great service from AAA, but Arizona AAA another story, no help. I will definitely carry a secondary road side service when traveling through arizona. this is not me ramping and raving this is the short version trust me.. this is for your info so that you can expect this possibly.... this was between Buckeye and Cali on the 10 freeway BEWARE!!!!!! The car still sits 50 miles from phoenix as my daughters friend drives her and her tire to firestone, then back to the car in the middle of nowhere, not to mention this friend had to take off of work, a professional, not a minimum wage worker where these things are expected, not a good widget for this guy.. what a good friend!! I am so thankful. I had to rate it so giving one star but only because it exists and there was someone to say ""I am sorry"" over a hundred times.",negative
"I had AAA years ago in Wisconsin and the service was good. Now in Arizona, I bought a membership for myself, my son's family and my brother for the last two years. All of us had the same BAD experience. I called AAA with a flat tire. I waited 2 1/2 hours and called again. They never showed up after 3 1/2 hours. Same thing happened with my son while he had his one year old in the car with him. I called customer service next day to complain and their attitude was a ""too bad"" attitude, ""it can take a long time usually a few hours""; but when they never show up? and after 3 calls?? AAA is a terrible waste of money. Don't be fooled by customer service replies, they will do nothing for you. They could have offered to remiburse the private tow fees we had to pay. The problem is the PHOENIX ARIZONA Management; other areas for AAA are usually quite good. If you can get coverage via your auto insurance do so; its bad enough to get poor road service, but then to get poor customer service also on the phone is shameful. The CEO or Business management for the Phoenix area is seriously lacking concern with no oversight. AAA used to be a prideful name; Phoenix will change your mind.",negative
"Been sitting here in Phoenix for two hours waiting for a truck to change a flat tire. I call AAA back for a status update and they claim they don't know what happened to my truck but they'll dispatch another one that'll be here in 90 minutes. So I am supposed to sit and wait over 3 hours for a simple dispatch within city limits? That's crazy! Finally gave up and called Honda. Within 20 minutes they had a service tech here! It seems like the last three times we have called, we have waited over an hour. I'm dropping AAA effective immediately. It's a complete waste of money!",negative
"Terrible service. Doesn't take responsibility. Technician claimed my batter was not dead. Did NOT replace it and told me to go to my own dealership. So, I did. The dealership said it WAS the battery and now AAA is refusing to reimburse.",negative
"Yesterday I stopped into the office on Glendale Ave to renew my membership. Now I could have done this on line and saved myself a lot of time but you have an associate there named Teresa and she rocks! She is so friendly and outgoing and personable that I actually ENJOY my annual office visits. I'm from Philly and although she's not she's got South Philly all about her, that's a good thing. That being said you really NEED to give her a raise, and don't make me say it again. Remember, I'm from Philly and you know how we are- Mr AAA Bossman doesn't want to wake up with a horse's head in his bed DOES HE?! I'm kidding, horse's heads are so 40 years ago....Keep up the good work Miss T- xoxoxo",positive
"Tonight's heart wrenching news ( July 18,2017) of the 9 family members of the Hector Garnica family who horrifically perished being swept away by flash floods JOLTED me ..... for exactly a year ago the SAME FATE For my eldest daughter was THWARTED THANKS to the OUTSTANDING ADVISE and GUIDANCE from the EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE STAFF AT THIS OFFICE. Thank God we had AAA The many many years of old fashioned advice from my now 97-year-old former biochemist/ mountain climber father rang in my ears as my daughter and her girl friend drove away from San Diego with my dad's old Honda -- a gift. They had NEVER been out West ( born in Connecticut raised in Virginia and now Minneapolis). AND it was boiling hot also last July 2016-- they were driving Nevada Arizona Monument Valley to 4 corners to Denver to minneapolis. I had driven cross country with my family in 1962 and been through all these states. My father's words after years of us living in Salt Lake City "" ALWAYS keep your car tuned up... out there, all it takes is just a LITTLE rain, and you are driving out here and the road dips into a gully... you look up and a HUGE wall of water can be coming crashing towards you... so you hit the gas and GET OUT of that gully ASAP"". So I took a crazy wild chance and called AAA Roadside assistance called AAA Roadside assistance ( Phoenix). A warm gentleman answered and I told him how scared worried I was for my very green inexperienced daughter. I told him she was driving all the way through Monument Valley. Could he please tell me exactly where the gas stations were and other safety advice for these 2 young women. He gave me the locations distance but MOST IMPORTANT... he said, "" tell her if it starts raining she must immediately stop... Monument Valley has terrible flash floods and if she gets caught out there we will not be able to come out and save her.., it is very dangerous."" I found out later long after she drove home that trip, that huge black storm clouds were behind them as they drove last July. THEY LISTENED to the ADVICE AAA GAVE US and drove 90 mph stopping only for essential gas NO SIGHTSEEING until they were out and safe on high ground in Utah across the border. AND thank God I called the Denver AAA office as well? the girls were planning on driving fast and diagonally to Denver through the middle of the state of Colorado . AAA DENVER SAID,"" NO NO NO ???... the roads through that area may turn into dirt roads and our flash floods at this time will COMPLETELY WASH OUT THESE ROADS... she needs to drive straight North in the far western area off the state all the way to the crowded under construction slower interstate to Denver... IT IS SAFER??? I know tonight while she watched the news of the Hector Garnica family MASSIVE tragedy.... my daughter is quietly shaking... and saying ... "" thank God Mom called AAA...."" I only wish I had written this on Yelp earlier....",positive
7 hours later and their now claiming they can't replace their warranted battery.just go buy one. Can't even get a jump until tomorrow,negative
"Dear AAA, Every year since I was 16 years old which is almost 45 years ago, I have had a AAA Premium Card, through my family business which is located in Tucson, Arizona. A decade ago, I moved abroad with my career (Principal at International Schools worldwide) and my father and I along with AAA agreed it was no longer necessary to provide me with an actual AAA card, as I lived/worked abroad. Still, I was privileged to visit AAA and retain the benefits I had always enjoyed. Fair enough. My father spends a great deal of money every year with his business on AAA. Yesterday, June 8. 2017 I visited AAA on 742 E Glendale Ave Phoenix Arizona 85020 where I purchased my International Drivers License which I have done for over 20 years. (my mother lives in Phoenix and this is where I stay when visiting her) Yesterday is the first time I was charged a non-AAA Member price. Although I do appreciate that just the average person shouldn't be permitted to walk in to a AAA and expect benefits without a membership, I feel this is the case with me and my support of AAA for 45 years. Food for thought for you. The customer care at AAA on 742 E Glendale Ave is outstanding. But in the future I shall visit the AAA in East Tucson where I am still a valued AAA Member, without a AAA Card. Thank you AAA. I do appreciate and value your services. Sincerely, Nadine C. Cooper International Educator",negative
"Super Impressed with the service I received today! My teen just bought a car and even though I'm not a member, we decided to skip the DMV and use AAA services for title and registration services. We were promptly greeted and had very little wait before we were called back to Patricia's office. She was very friendly and helpful and guided us through the whole process. I was completely shocked to see her pull out a real license plate from her desk and the tags AND a screwdriver! The whole process took probably less than 20 mins. Well worth the bit extra it costs to use their services. I'm considering getting a membership just because of the great service I received! Thank you!",positive
"I am very disappointed in AAA. I have been a member for over 17 years but that ended today! I believe their auto renewal ""service"" without your permission is at the very least deceptive and most likely fraudulent.",negative
"Amazing service out of the gate from Rose Bergeron. She was quick to understand what I was there for, and was able to very quickly find the solution to the problem and got me in and out of there within a very few minutes. Very impressed with her and her willingness to make sure I was a very pleased customer. Thanks Rose! & Thanks AAA Arizona!",positive
"I was satisfied with the service I got from AAA. I thought I locked my keys in my car and called them right away. They were so fast getting back to me and sending someone to help, but I did eventual find out that I had my keys with me the whole time and when I called them back about that they were not upset and just happy I was able to get into my car safely.",positive
"I love love love AAA. Always good to have in case you need a tow. Went in here the other day to register mine and my husband's cars since we still had CA plates. Oh my gosh, I could not get over how fast, easy, and convenient it was!! Walked in around 4 and waited less than 5 minutes to be seated. I wish I could remember the name of the woman who helped us, she was quick and super kind. In less than 30 minutes we were walking out with our new plates and registration ready to go! So glad we have AAA and decided to let them handle this one for us. Just so so easy. Thanks AAA!",positive

aaa has left me stranded more times then my car im not even sure what im paying for .. i called a to be towed at 4 from las vegas to my house about 90 miles away not only did i sit in sweltering heat from 4pm until almost 9 pm where they informed me they could not find any tow truck drivers .. in las vegas ? there are i hundreds of them i ended up paying top dollar cause it was so LATE AND TO TOP IT OFF I WAS ACTUALLY BROKE DOWN IN THE SAME PARKING LOT AS A AAA OFFICE... AAA ISNT WHAT IT USED TO BE SAD BUT TRUE .. CORPORATE AMERICA,negative
"AAA'S inability to change my tire only compounded the level of frustration I had in my inability to not slice my tire open on a curb. Not only did I not avoid the curb, I also left my jack kit in my travel trailer. So I passed this essential information to the customer service personnel on the phone. So 30 minutes later, upon the arrival of the AAA technician it was soon discovered that they also don't carry jack kits in their *TIRE SERVICE VEHICLES*. I call back. Tech wrote ""customer will change his own tire"". I request a tow truck. AAA offers to tow my F150 to Discount Tire, recommended by AAA. An hour later, I am at discount tire. Discount Tire tells me it will be at least 2 hours. So, all in all I am an idiot for not keeping my jack kit in my truck. I am an idiot for hitting a curb. I am a fool for trusting that AAA could change my freaking tire. I have learned my lesson.",negative
"Been a loyal customer of theirs for over a decade, and never once let us down. I mean yes sometimes the wait is an hour or so - but more often than not its closer to 30 minutes - and having a 12 year old vehicle its nice peace of mind. the guys that come out are always nice and pleasant. Thank you.",positive
"This location showed as an ADOT location to deal with Vehicle license, registration, and such. I was pleasantly surprised that they provided this service as it is only a short distance from my house. They transferred my documents to our new location with ease. I hate going to the normal ADOT offices as it take forever to do anything. I was in and out in 15 minutes for three vehicles! Way to go!",positive
"Very polite and welcoming on the phone when I inquired if they had a notary and could do passport pictures. Receptionist very helpful and friendly. Notary service and photos done quickly and efficiently, by another excellent employee. An A+ experience in terms of courtesy and helpfulness.",positive
"I eventually got the help i was looking for after i had to advocate for it pretty determinedly... Front desk woman gave me limited amount of literature, sold me $50 in books and tried to shoo me out door. I explained i called ahead and expected to be able to discuss my trip with a planner. They acted like that was a very complicated request and told me they don't take appointments which i know to be untrue. I waited for the planner (which they tried to talk me out of). The trip planner told me i needed to tell her step by step which points of interest i wanted to see on my trip while i was there to discuss which route to take and what each route offered. It was incredibly exhausting trying to navigate continuous road blocks to the service you have repeatedly expressed needing. I ultimately got the service i was requesting despite the woman telling me she doesn't ""deal in campgrounds"". Frustrated - i shouldn't have to convince service people to provide their service. Tell me how you CAN help me not how you CAN'T.",negative
"Planning a cruise in the Hawaiian islands, I was overwhelmed with the many decisions to make. A friend asked ""are you a member of AAA?"" (Yes) - she said, call them! I am so glad I did, Gene had all the information needed, and provided in depth reference information regarding the cruise ship, hotels, air, tours, simplifying the entire planning process. Plus, the office was full of extras, maps, guide books, travel accessories - everyone was extremely helpful. It was a great experience.",positive
"Patricia helped me over the phone, my car was towed and I had to get it out of the tow yard, I could not locate my vehicle registration or my AAA card, she emailed a copy of my card and was such a good listener, she helped me through a stressful day. Thanks AAA for having wonderful employees!",positive
"If you're planning a trip anywhere- USA, Europe, Asia.... Make this AAA office your first stop! Make an appt w Gene, and he will help guide you through all the details, and offer great advise, and knowledge of flights, hotels and trains. There are many wonderful travel related items for sale, wallets, socks, wine bags, and Purses just to name a few. Theresa at the front desk helped suggest some necessary travel items. You will be helped by all of their friendly advise, and travel knowledge! So thankful that we have AAA membership.",positive

"I was not happy with their mobile battery service. After getting my car started with a jump-start they then needed to run some ""diagnostic testing"" to determine the quality of my battery. The battery test came out as ""needs to be replaced"". I was told by the service person my car would not start the next day unless I got a new battery. He just happened to have a brand new battery available for purchase right then and there from their service truck. At the time, it appeared the service person was doing me a favor by getting me a new battery to ensure my car would start again. It seems to me as if this service truck comes with the intent of selling a new AAA battery. I am disappointed in this AAA service. This is not what I expect when I buy my yearly membership. It states on their website that AAA is ""Roadside Assistance You Can Trust"". This mobile battery truck is not service I trust. I have heard of other people being told that their battery would not hold a charge and must be replaced, only to find their car starting without a problem after recharging the battery. For instance, one person I know of needed a jump-start from AAA after the interior light was left on over-night. The service person indicated the battery needed to be replaced and offered to get them a brand new AAA battery. They declined, and were told again they really should have the battery replaced. They took the car to their local shop, which did a full recharge of the battery (took 1 hour). That was several weeks ago, and they have had no problems with the battery or starting the car since. Their battery is not brand new, but it is still working well enough to start their car. Be aware of this, and that the service person may try to sell a battery. I would advise taking the car to your regular mechanic shop to have them evaluate it. It may be that you do not need a new battery.",negative
I love triple AAA discount at payless along with a free passport photos yearly! Free travel guides and maps :) ahhh so worth the membership! Best of all road side assistance! Lots of parking at this location! A travelers best friend!,positive
"I am so happy to have AAA. They have been a total life saver on more than one occasion. They will tow your car. Bring you gas, change a flat tire, and jump start your car. Once i even purchased a battery from them and their mobile van service. You can also get trip tiks, discounts on travel and many more items. Certain restaurants will give you a discount with your triple A card.. hard Rock anywhere in the country for one. This is something i think everyone should have. It is a life saver.",positive
"I flew in from Washington, went to my house, and headed to the golf course. Unfortunately my van wouldn't start. How could this be? My son had just purchased a battery for the van from AAA several weeks before, so I called AAA and they had someone out in 10 minutes. He checked the battery, and the charging system, and everything seemed all right. He then checked the battery again, and found that there was a dead cell. He replaced the battery with no questions asked, and apologized for the dead battery. He was very professional throughout, and definitely knew what he was doing. And I did get to the golf course in time. What more could you ask!! Five stars definitely.",positive
"Used on our wedding day to go from Hotel to ceremony, then ceremony to venue. Very reasonably priced, arrived early, clean car, excellent customer service before/after, and friendly driver. Everything you could ask for in a Limo Service.",positive
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Initially, I thought I was getting a great deal. Aaron and I agreed to 3 hours at $95 per hour for my son's graduation, and I advised that I would pay in cash if that was okay. He said ""Sure, customers do it all the time. Simply pay the driver. We won't charge your card. We just need it to confirm the reservation."" So it was settled...I thought. The driver, Steven, seemed to be a pleasant gentleman. He arrived earlier than expected and greeted my son very nicely. They went to dinner, but after that it was all downhill. The driver was stuck on a wrong street and the boys had to help him turn around. They almost needed to call a tow truck...luckily they got out and made it home safely. I paid the driver cash and he advised that he'd leave the funds with my invoice on Accounting's desk, so that I would not be double-billed through my card. I said, great! The event was on a Friday...by Monday afternoon, I was charged $380 to my bank account. I WAS LIVID! If they were going to do something other than what we'd agreed upon, I could've simply left the funds in my account. Secondly, the fee was completely over what I'd agreed to. I agreed to 3 hours, but was charged for 4 hours. So I paid $340 and then they stole $380 from my bank account. I thought well it was probably an honest mistake, let me call and get this figured out. I got the run around for 2 days from Miriam (who refused to give me the manager's name) and then Aaron finally stated that I was right and the charge would be reversed. They only reversed $292 and still left me with the remaining $88 that should've been reversed as well. I called again the third day. Guess what? He answered the line, heard my voice and hung up in my face. I called again, another person says...um he's out for the next 30-45 minutes. So...in essence, I had called 11 times over the course of 3 days in an attempt to resolve while my account gets overdraft fees, etc. Still NO RESOLVE to this day! We are currently in dispute unfortunately and I will NEVER deal with this so-called business again! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! The next transportation company I deal with will need to create a written contract, because some people aren't trustworthy...SMH",negative
"What a wonderful team to work with. Accent/Jet limo took very good care of my VIP guest. We requested the Mercedes sedan and were blown away. We only use them, and don't recommend anyone else. Thanks Billy!",positive
"I really REALLY wanted to like this company. After numerous problems with my normal provider, I was ready for a positive change. Here was my experience with one trip with Accent. When you make an online reservation, you get a bounceback saying it's not confirmed, until an agent reviews and sends another email. Seems senseless. Regardless, a day later, I got a confirmation, and they had the wrong outbound pick-up date. You then have to write them with the mistake, and then wait another day for someone to respond with the correction. On the day of my pick-up, the driver was on time, and the car was super clean. PLUS, she was incredibly professional and personable. I asked her if the charge was different on the outbound or return, as my confirmations showed two different fares, and she said they should be the same, and that she was on her way to the office, and would investigate. Sure enough, about an hour later, she texted me that the office made a mistake (not in my favor, mind you), and would be sending a revised invoice. She was fantastic in follow-up, so, big kudos there. BUT, if I hadn't of pursued this, it would have been something where I sent in an expense report for $$, and then got billed $$$. My return trip...I had booked a sedan for a reason. The driver showed up in a Lincoln Navigator, which, to someone with a back injury, is a horrendous ride. She said it was an ""upgrade"". I see it as ""not what I booked and paid for"". My back was flaming the entire ride home. Not good, not good. She did offer to take me to the office to get a new car, which, was nice, but really? Wish I had an extra 30 minutes to be carted around while they provide what I ordered.. The final straw? Today I get a phone call from a third party - saying they were hired by Accent to evaluate customer experiences. Seriously? So, apparently Accent gives out your personal information to third parties. Awesome. Anyway, the drivers were great - but everything else kinda sucked. Wrong itinerary, wrong receipt, wrong vehicle, big no no giving personal info to third parties. Too much wrong for a first trip, I'm afraid.",negative
"Accent Transportation provided top-notch service on our wedding day. The prices are very reasonable, communication was straightforward and responsive. We received an email on the day of the wedding with the drivers' names and contact information, which we found extremely helpful to coordinating last-minute logistics. The drivers were very professional and kind. We will definitely use them in the future.",positive
"Excellent customer service, accessible staff, and awesome drivers. We rented two buses for our non profit organization event where we were picking up families from different locations for a community dinner, and then getting them back to their homes. Mary Ann from Accent Transportation (Jet Limo) was awesome with her communications. She picked up the phone every time I made the call and assisted me to my satisfaction. The two drivers, Rhonda and another lady ( I cant remember her name :( were excellent and had no trouble following directions. In addition, I constantly got status updates via Email. Over all, I had a great experience with this company. Will definitely use them again.",positive
"Accent Limo provided very professional service and everything was perfect for my wedding day. The specific limo I reserved was exactly what showed up at my door, on time and ready to go. They are very professional and great with communication via phone or email.",positive
"I searched on Yelp and thought they would be the best. I booked them on a Saturday for a Tuesday pick up. Come Monday, I still haven't got a confirmation of any sort or a charge to my CC. I phoned them around 4pm to confirm my reservation. Although the lady remembered my call, she couldn't find anything in her system. Hugh disappointment since I gave her my CC info and other personal details on Saturday. So she began to ask me for my info all over again. I stopped her and asked what would have happened to the pick up of by VP if I hadn't called to confirm. She said, Oh, I'm sure he still would have been picked up. What? How? That seems crazy. When I told her I'd prefer to go with someone else. She hung up on me. NOT PROFESSIONAL at all & rude! She could have just apologized and offered a discount for next time or this time or something.",negative
"Overall, a great experience. Misgana worked with me to stay within my budget - definetly one of the more affordable services in the Phoenix area (and I called all over!!) Scott the driver was great also. They helped make my wife's 40th bday a day she will never forget.",positive
"Efficent, affordable, excellent service and beautiful cars. That about sums up Accent Transportation Services. For our recent wedding, we were in need of several limos to take us from the venue to the church and back again. We did extensive research on Yelp and relied on the good rating of Accent's listing. After taking a look at their vehicles and speaking with the reps, we decided they were the transportation service to go with! Accent arrived to our pick-up location on-time and nicely waited at the church until the ceremony was over. The cars are very nice, clean and have water inside. We ordered two stretch limos (one white, one black) and one escalate stretch limo. Each limo was in perfect condition and fitting for a wedding celebration! There isn't much more that I can say, other than that Accent is a great choice for any of your transportation needs.",positive
"I had the pleasure of riding with Accent Transportation in March 2013. I used them for a meeting that I held in Phoenix, AZ. Their chauffeurs were fantastic. They were attentive and very knowledgeable about Phoenix and it's surrounding areas. This was actually the second time I used them, each for personal and meetings. I see mention of Rhonda below and I would like to echo that review. She is awesome. Their vehicles were fantastic. I was able to sample a party bus. It was brand spanking new, with a pole! My clients loved it. They also had a new Mercedes, Sprinter. Awesome for a small group or executive travel. I highly recommend this vehicle. I took a sedan to the airport and I received the same level of service and vehicle their. The owners of this company are dedicated to consistency in their service and for sure, with their clients in mind.",positive
"We used Accent for our daughters wedding. They provided a mini coach for the rehearsal dinner, a mini coach and 2 limos for the day of the wedding. It was difficult to plan and times and locations changed several times before the actual day. Accent was a pleasure to work with. They arrived on time, the vehicles were exactly what we reserved. Charges were exactly what was quoted. They were accommodating and professional and I would not hesitate recommend them.",positive
I arrived at the airport and was met by Rhonda. She was the only chauffeur that was using an iPad as a sign and it looked great. She was very helpful and kind. She carried my bags and escorted me out to the beautiful black shiny town car. She offered a five minute tour of the city on the way to the hotel. Highly recommend this company!,positive
"Amazing service!!! Rosa was Courteous and punctual. When I called, they arranged payment/gratuity in advance which was a major plus( I never carry cash) and I loved that they tracked my flight and called the moment I landed to ensure I knew where to meet the driver. The car was clean and the ride was smooth( I get severe motion sickness so this was a big deal to me) so I would certainly use this service again if ever in the Phoenix area!",positive
"Have been a customer for years using their service to and from airport as well as in city needs... All my out of town guests and colleagues use the service and i have not even considered another service. Rates are very reasonable and service, drivers, quality of vehicles are superior to any other company.",positive
"What a great experience I had with Accent. I was on a business trip & it was my first time to Phoenix. The driver picked me up at the airport on time, with a clean car and he was so polite & professional. He gave me a lot of information about the area & waited at the hotel to make sure I had a reservation there (as I wasn't sure which hotel I was booked at). It was a pleasure dealing with their office staff as well. I travel a lot for business and use car services across the country. Accent is on top of my list for being the most customer service oriented.",positive
Don't use this company. They do not clearly state what their prices will be at the end of service. I spoke with them several times setting up our reservation and asked about the total price. It turned out to be double what the quote stated. Scam!!,negative
"My wife and I needed some wheels from our wedding to our hotel that night, so I did a Yelp search and found Accent. After talking with them a couple of times I decided to use them to pick us up. I rented a town car for us for that night. When our reception was over, I was happy to walk out to the parking lot and find we not only had our ride waiting at the end of the sidewalk, we had an upgrade (it was either an escalade or a suburban)! The driver was very pleasant and professional, and he had jazz music on lightly, which I thought was a nice touch. The ride was smooth. Most importantly, they were on time and got us to our hotel safely. It was also nice to get 2 different email notifications through the process letting me know they were on top of things. I'd definitely use Accent in the future.",positive
Celebrated my little girls birthday with 10 friends with Accent Limo! Everything smooth from booking to drop off! Drive James was as kind and courteous as they come! Absolutely would use and recommend them!,positive
"I used Accent for my wedding, they provided a 33 passenger bus shuttle service to/from my wedding. They were very reasonably priced, close to $200 cheaper than the nearest quote. The driver arrived on time, and was very pleasant. They did get lost on one of the return trips, but wasn't a big deal. Would use them again.",positive
"Scott was our driver for an evening on the town with my wife. He was extremely professional. We had the stretched lincoln limo. It was very professional inside. Nothing crazy like flashing lights or strobes going on. It was the perfect ride for a lovely evening with my wife. What was also nice was that the driver wasnt chatty at all. He allowed us to enjoy the ride, as he took us to our destinations. He was a complete gentleman the entire time. He put the divider up the minute we told him where we were off too. Too many times drivers leave this down and start being chatty. Just do what your supposed to do and drive us! :) I would definately use them again or recommend them. They did have a few other cars as well including a Chrystler 300 with all the stroby lights and neon for proms and such, a fleet of town cars and buses all for rental. I am glad I chose Accent Limos. They made the night perfect!",positive
"I rented a car for a week from these guys. I saw the negative responses left by others on here... Look, this is a low-cost car rental. You cannot expect champagne taste when you have a Bud Light budget. It's just like flying Allegiant Airlines. You can't expect all the same things that you'd get from flying on, let's say, Virgin Airlines. C'mon now. Yes there was a line at the counter. Guess what, it's Las Vegas. It's always busy! Yeah, they only had two customer service people working. That's probably how they keep their costs down. We ran into a small problem at the counter. They didn't have my car that I reserved ready right then. I was on a tight time schedule so I couldn't wait for it. But the customer service representative more than accommodated me. I won't go into the details but the point is when problems arise, AND THEY WILL, what counts is how they get handled. And I feel they did a good job there. Also, it helps to keep a cool head with the people behind the counter. A guy ahead of me was fuming over everything. Yelling and screaming. It got him nowhere. Yes, the car was a tad dirty on the inside. But there again, for $160 for a whole week... who cares! If you want a spic-and-span, freshly detailed sedan, then go spend $400 a week on one. Grow up people. Seriously.",positive
"This company is affiliated with advantage rental car. The reserved customers with reservations have to wait comparison to the ones that are just arriving without a confirmed reservations. The way they do business is ridiculous and a waste of time to those who had hours of flights then have to wait in a long line cuz their system is broken, its just a complete disaster. I will never again will do any business with this company. This is stupid & a waste of my trips that are planned ahead ?",negative
"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST! I made an internet reservation and arrived at the reservation counter. I went through the whole process of declining everything she was trying to sell and was about to pay. Luckily I looked at the screen because instead of my 3 day rate of $63 I was about to be charged $975. She said it's for a 3 week rental plus the deposit. I told her no, it was a 3 day rental. She said I did not have one for 3 days. I showed her the confirmation and she said nope I don't have that reservation. She didn't offer to help me find another car or to fix the problem. Mind you it was 1:00am. I simply said thank you and walked to the Budget desk where I got a $58 reservation for the same car. This was absolutely the worst experience ever! If I could give them ZERO stars I would.",negative
"I don't know whose fault it was but we definitely had a bad experience with Advantage. we were supposed to arrive at the airport at 10 but we got a notification that our flight was delayed and we would be arriving at 4am the next day. We booked our car rental with Advantage through Expedia. So we called Expedia telling them that our flight would be delayed and to make sure they hold off our rental. they said that they called Advantage and they said Advantage told them that they we're gonna hold it off for 24hours since we already paid for it. When we finally arrived, we went to Advantage to pick up the rental car and to our dismay, we were told that we were late and there are no more cars available. we booked a full sized car and they said they only have the 15 seater van available. they had about 15 cars in the garage but all with expired license plates so they cannot be rented. there we were, all tired and disappointed. the Advantage guy told me I could use the van and exchange it in the morning because he has cars coming in for return. so we took the van to the hotel and went back after 4 hours to exchange the car. When i got there, i was told that there is still no car and they can only exchange it for another 15 seater van. i was so pissed so i decided to ask them to cancel the whole reservation and give me a full refund. they told me i needed to pay for the first day since we took the van and if we hadn't accepted the van we would have been given the full refund. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i was too tired to argue and just paid it and went immediately with National where I had a much better experience.",negative
"They charge 9 dollars/gallon if your car is returned car tank is even a little tiny bit not full. I returned car with needle not being completely full, and they rounded down to 7/8th full, 2 gallons of gas as 9 dollars/gallon. They call it ""inconvenience fee"". The price is not displayed at the counter and the agent wont tell you about it. I read some positive reviews before I rented but now I realize that they are probably fake or paid reviews.",negative
If i could gove 0 stars i would .... quote 260 plus deposit for a week rental car ... wake up over 900$ in charges ... go back to airport fight the lones and we are told they didnt charge all that money ... hey sparky its a brand new card and the online statement says ez rental did yesterday. Nothing we can do the rude manager says ... Bullshit ... worst company ever . Thats our hotel money so now we sleep in a camry for the next week ....,negative
"I would recommend any other company aside from Fox rental car over Advantage. There were two guys working at the counter, one who never got off his cell phone on a personal call, and the other who helped me. Seemed like it was his first day. After wasting about 15 minutes of my time getting me registered, he mentioned the 300$ drop off fee since I would be returning the car at a different airport. Could have saved us. Orth time had that been mentioned off the bat. 300$ is an outrageous fee",negative
"Nice car, but they sold me prepaid fuel and misrepresented what I was buying. When. I went to return the car the manager was unavailable but the employees resoundingly said call in the morning to have it error removed. The morning manager was a pain and would not remove the charge can kept referring to the contract that their own employees said would not be a problem. Nothing worse than unmet expectations in the face of being reasonable. I will NEVER use this service again.",negative
"Advantage is correct. I believe they try to take advantage of their customers. I have rented cars from other companies before, and I have always purchased their additional insurance (as the fee was not crazy, and the type of coverage provided was clear). I was going to charge my rental to my American Express for this occasion, which offers some coverage, so I was opting to go with the least coverage with this company. Can you say ""talking in circles"". While never rude, and handling my ever increasing frustration professionally, the sales rep (yes sales rep, as I felt like I was at a subpar used car dealership) did a horrible job explaining how the insurance coverage worked, and attempted to make me feel like I would regret not getting the highest insurance coverage (never experienced this with other companies). I had never heard some of the things that this customer service representative said (including what could potentially happen if I did not purchase their insurance and got pulled over by a police officer). I will never rent from this company again. The only plus was the ease of returning the vehicle. Oh, and I usually fill up the car prior to returning the rental to the company. For the first time, I decided not to, as I did not easily spot any gas stations during my travel. They do not clearly show what price they will charge for gas if you choose not to fill it up yourself (as I have seen with other companies I have previously used). The customer service rep did attempt to get me to purchase the option of having them refuel prior to leaving, but by that time I did not want to hear anything else from him. I saw behind him a price of $1.95 which I assume was the price that I would be charged if I took the deal that he was offering. So I figured, they would probably charge me about $5 per gallon. OH, I WAS WRONG. I was charged $9 per gallon where the price per gallon was $1.80-$1.95 as I saw when we passed by gas stations when riding with my husband's family. All I have to say is, NEVER AGAIN.",negative
"I have frequented this establishment and every experience I have had with them has been great. I always get fast service, short lines, and friendly staff. Rizalina is always very helpful and getting me and my family the best deals out there even if they for some reason need to send you to another company. Just recently I did have a small issue with one of the cars but Danny made sure things where taking care of very quick and efficiently.",positive
"Liars and Crooks in disguise here. Grabbed me on my way to pick up my rental from another company. Offered me a car for $20/day. Talked me into the insurance after I declined. I told them I may be a little late returning, they said not to worry as there is a 59 minute grace period, it's only $7/hour for the first 3 hours, then a full day charge. The total when I walked away from the counter was $63. I returned the car about 25 minutes late, and expected to pay an extra hour. On the contrary, the guy who processed my return said ""no extra charges, have a nice day"". I walked away feeling good, and happy I found a new place to rent from. I got an email of my bill a couple of hours later. $115. I called to ask why, and like a robot, the manager Kayla just protected her staff and the charges. This is bad business and they know it. Never again, stay away!",negative
They overcharged me by $40 and told me they couldn't refund it there and I had to call a phone number. For the first 2 months the phone number didn't work. Then it worked and told me to leave a message. I left a message and it said it would call me back in 24 hours. 2 months later I called the number again and this time talked to a person. He said he couldn't do anything and that I had to call the Vegas branch. The one that gave me the number to corporate because they said they couldn't do anything. They tried calling them while I waited on the line and said they couldn't get through.,negative

My phone number they used wasn't even on the paperwork, my address was wrong, my email was not on the contract, nor my DL. Idiots! Need I go on! NO SUPERVISORS on site! They refused to change out the car. They kept my deposit. I called several times to the corporate offices and they said there was nothing they could do and refused a refund.

"Check in. Wait was ok but when I got to the counter the rep started to argue with a past customer. both parties were rude but the rep should of been more professional. When it was my turn I could tell he was rushing me and tried to typical insurance up sell but I told him I had renters insurance thru my cc. He said liability is mandatory in navada so unless I can show him proof I had to purchase it. OK he won. I then tried to present my 5% off deal with yelp and he said that's for the next rental. Bs. Told me to wait until someone called me as the car was getting cleaned. OK sure Got to the car pick up and the guy handed me the key and said for me to look for scratches. OK none but car was filthy. He said ok I'm good to go. Don't they usually check the car with the customer? Driving the car I notice car had less the 3/4 gas and the worker put full tank on the sheet. I called to let them know. Inside car was stained and had over 40,000 miles on it. And over 65mph the car started to shake. Drop off I parked the car and walked towards the station when someone yelled Yo I look back and some guy in regular clothes calling me back. Apparently he worked there and checked me out with his iPad. Obviously didn't know about the call I made about the gas not being full so I had to explain again. Said it was good and he were on our way. Wouldn't go here again bottom line",negative
"Car that was provided was old and had issues (Chrysler 200 Convertible). I am a business traveler, I know when to buy car insurance. I have premium AMEX card (covers high $'s for rental) and great car insurance. The guy at counter tried to sell me insurance even though I didn't need it, then kept on cursing in slow tone. I can hear you, hello. May be he wanted me to hear it. He kept on saying shit shit and F word too. That's ridiculous, never coming to advantage again. Don't get any convertible there, all they have shitty is old Chrysler 200's. Car was so bad, we had issues with pickup and car jerked a lot. Remote didn't work to convert the car, have to sit in and use inside button. When I told they guy at return, he said - all convertible are old and have issues and not sure why they still keeping it.

"The longest wait ever to rent a car!! There were two agents working at the counter with only four people waiting to rent in front of me and it took 45 minutes. An additional 15 minutes to actually do the paperwork and wait for a car to be washed when we got to the counter. That shouldn't be the case since I already reserved the car online. I've rented many times from Enterprise, Hertz and Avis but never had this problem with them. The only positive was that the agent who took care of our rental was nice. Never again rent from them.",negative
This rent a car is a rip off. They advertise unlimited miles and once you get there with your booked reservation they tell you there's a limit of 150 miles. And the staff is totally rude.. I will never rent here they are the worst and that explains why they are one of the smallest. Not recommended.,negative
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got scammed into booking a convertible into what looked like $29 a night from an online ad by them, but came out to be $80 with all the hidden charges then when I arrived to check in they told me I needed to have proof of insurance. I handed the man at the counter my insurance card and he said I need to call them to confirm. He then came back 5 minutes later with, ""Your insurance co. is closed on sunday so I cannot give you the car to rent because I need proof that you have insurance"" Me, ""are you serious read my insurance card you foreign IDIOT!!!!!"" I was so angry esp. because I had already booked this online and PAID! He said Im sorry there is nothing we can do. Well Please give me a print out of my full refund. Him', ""You have to call this number, there is nothing I can do"" .... literally then he said next in line.... OMG I have never been so mistreated and angry at the same time. This place needs to be shut down its ghetto, trashy, run like shit, and a complete joke! AGAIN STAY AWAY this place will only hassle you and waste your time! I decided to go to hertz and got a convertible mustang for cheaper than this place believe it or not and it was hassle free, I was in like for a minute and within 10 minutes in the rental car on my way to LA.

"The price was great but there was nothing ""easy"" about renting from E-Z. Issues: - 30 minute wait to get to customer service agent to rent car. - The only agent working when I arrived spent the entire 30 minutes with one customer, crushing the line. - Eventually a second agent started working - The whole time a person I can describe only as ""a barker"" was out telling the line to move this way or that and asking passers-by if they wanted a rental car. She stood by uselessly for 30 minutes when an empty station was available and long line of customers needing service. - After getting through the first agent, to my horror you had to talk to another one in the garage to get your keys, adding 7 more minutes of hell and taking the total time to 40 minutes before I could sit in my car. This is why people pay for Hertz Gold. - The car return process was a nightmare. The rental form had no address for the LAX return center (I did a one-way rental) and E-Z is not big enough to be listed on the airport signs. So I used my GPS and ended up in front of a construction site. Tried Google Maps and ended up nowhere. Called and got a reference point (""near the Sheraton Gaeway"") which eventually lead me there. Time wasted: 20 minutes, all while trying to make a plane. - The actual return site was a shack in the corner of an Easy Park long-term parking. - The service team was rude - They left one guy standing in the wrong place, missing two shuttles before he had to ask how he got the airport There's cheap and then there's rinky-dink. This is rinky-dink.",negative
I would use this rent-a-car service again. Fast counter service and great friendly staff outside the door...Kudos keep it up,positive
"I feel like I should chime in because I was pretty worried about renting from these guys after reading the reviews. All in all, it was pretty good. The wait in line was a little longer than ideal, but they did move through people. They were generally pushy about the insurance and prepaid gas thing. (""Would you like the full coverage insurance or just the basic?"" as if no insurance was not an option.) However, that's about par for the course on renting a car. They did let me decline both without too much hassle. The key is to just not try to explain to them why you're declining. The car was nice and in good condition. Returning the car was a breeze and there were no surprises. In short, they were exactly like every other car rental outfit I've ever been to except they cost less, which I liked.",positive
"Had a reservation made on line prior to arriving to Las Vegas, we were informed that they over booked and no cars are available anymore. Complained to the manager but she informed us that we did not pay in advance, the reservation was just a reservation without obligation. We were shocked and furious to such customer service and business ethics of these people. In addition, they tried to refer us to other car rental companies who are charging too much since there was no reservation made. We think that E-Z rental company is a dummy/fake company whom taking all car rental reservations but without CARS available for you once you get there. Hence, you are force to rent with other car rental places with a higher price since you don't have a choice/time to shop around. These car rental people are working as co-horts to increase car fees due to high demand at the moment of unsuspecting tourists. AVOID them at all cost, I will rather pay extra to well known car companies than be under the mercy of such unethical business operation.",negative
"Female agent at hertz was very unprofessional and snobby so we went online n found e-z. Made the reservation at 10am, waked over to e-z at 10:01am. We were assisted by Marie, whom was very friendly n informative. She not only provided great customer service with a smile...she offered us a free upgrade because they were out of the vehicle we reserved. Vehicle is in great shape too. Not pushy at all when it came to insurance. We re happy customers. Highly recommended! :-)",positive
"well it helps that they are located in the las vegas new rental car center which is bigger than some airports that I have flown into. The wait in line is too long, they make you sign so many forms that I thought I was buying the car. The price is misleading as well. The quote you get from the website is a estimate and they tack on $10 in some sort of fees. The cars are fine but I thought it could have been cleaner. The guy that checks your car takes his time as well. But overall not bad if you get a car for $13 a day- which was the cheapest in the rental car center. I am spoiled tho since I use Hertz gold for my business travels.",negative
"THIS LOCATION TRIED TO SCAM ME. PLEASE DO THOROUGH INSPECTION OF THE CAR YOU ARE RENTING. I rented a car for a week. When I was signing the papers, there was no mention on inspection report about any scratches or dings. But when I went to pick the car, I inspected and noticed few things. I went to the office and lady did not bother to come out and check. She just told me that she knew and it should be ok. It was enough for me as I have been renting cars in North America for more than 20 years. After a week, I dropped and all was good. After a week or so, I received an email from Alamo about damages on the car. There was a form to fill with my credit card info. I did not do thinking it might not be for me or sent in mistake. a week or two weeks later, I received another email with invoice of about $450.00 and photos of the damages. I was really upset. Luckily, I took few photos before picking the car. I told them and had few email exchanges. But at the end, Alamo gave up as I was correct and they wanted me to pay for the damages that were there. I received an email without any sorry or anything but just stating that they would take care of the damages and invoice. Now you tell me what I should call this. Am I correct calling it SCAM. Also I noticed on websites that lot of people had similar experiences with Alamo. I am in talks with few lawyers and checking my possibility of suing Alamo in general and this location in specific. So DO INSPECTION, TAKE PHOTOS before leaving the lot.",negative

"When we called to change pick up time, receptionist informed us there was a walk-a-thon and we should pick up our car before streets closed off. I'm so grateful for that receptionist or we would have ruined our travel plans for the day.",positive
"Excellent service and location. My buddy and I flew into Toronto and spent a couple of days there. The plan was to drive to Niagara Falls and fly home out of Buffalo. This location is right downtown and in an underground shopping center, which was very close to our hotel. We were picking up the car on Sunday and leaving after the Blue Jays game. Because the rental place closes earlier on Sundays, we had to take control of the vehicle before the game started. When I explained this to the guy at the counter he advised me to just leave the car in their garage until after the game, saving us from having to pay for parking it somewhere else. This was really cool and that's what we did. Also the price I booked online for two days and a one way rental was only $80 USD total. I thought that was really good as one-ways are usually super high. This was way better for us, as it gave us the flexibility to fly home out of either airport. thanks Alamo",positive
Price was the deciding factor as they were 25% less then anyone else. Location was convenient. Service was friendly and efficient. On the downside they didn't have the sub compact I asked for so we had to make do with a black Dodge Charger with all the bells and whistles for the same price. They even threw in a free second driver option to help cover the inconvenience. I was actually impressed with the fuel economy of the muscle car. We averaged 38 mpg on the trip to Ottawa. All in all pretty good.,positive
"DO NOT BOOK HERE. Had a reservation for Saturday at 4:00 pm. Called to double check at 3:15 and was assured everything was good. Arrived at 5 minutes to 4:00 pm and they had closed despite my reservation, phone call to double check the booking, and their office hours still being open. Knocked and called just to be ignored by the employee that was still in the back office. Called customer care and was offered a car at a high rate all the way at Pearson. No responsibility was taken by the company. Myself and 3 friends missed a wedding thanks to Alamo.",negative
"And just when you thought MAAAAAAYBE the last review was way harsh, the dumba$$es at American Airlines one-up their incompetence. Flight from Atlanta to LAX was loaded up and taxi-ing when suddenly- back to the terminal. The bucket of bolts and lameness has mechanical issues and that was it. So they say the flight is cancelled but they relist it and post it is leaving an hour later. An hour becomes two, three, they string people along till I last checked it was going out at 7:30 PM. I feel bad for any sap that hung around listening to their lies. Booked a direct flight on Delta the next day. Seriously, unless you're a self loathing sadist, don't ever fly American Airlines where ""Failure and Incompetence is guaranteed!""",negative
"Let me start by saying that I do not write A lot of bad reviews, so if I do then I've given a business more than one chance.. my husband took me to mission beach for Mother's Day weekend and we left yesterday from Phoenix sky harbor... we were rushing to get there had paid extra for priority on both of our tickets, let's forget that security had the priority line closed, and get to the fact we were at the gate 15 min before takeoff and were told, sorry, the door is closed we can't reopen them! This happened to us last year on my birthday trip to San Francisco also, same airline! Every flight was sold out out of Phoenix after our flight so rather fly standby being number 6 and 7 on the list I had the idea to fly into Orange County and drive to mission from there... great found a solution, for an extra 600$ total! Had they rolled us over to the oversold flights tho it would have been free! We were charged a ticket change fee, and a price difference fee when they usually and it's stated, close doors 10 minutes before takeoff. Also the 60+ dollars spent on priority didn't get transferred over or refunded it just disappeared ! So total for an hour trip to Cali was now over 1000$! Not to mention the extra charge from the rental car for getting it out of Orange County and returning it to San Diego! Fast forward three hours, flight ready to board and because when we were issued new tickets our seats were three rows away from each other so my husband went up to see what they could do so the very nice woman held our tickets and said she'd work on it because the people sitting next to both of us were flying alone. She was seriously so nice. After they got to group 7, we heard an announcement that there was no more room for overhead baggage so if you had a rollaway they would have to check it. So we got up to board and they tagged my husbands bag which is roll away and he was fine then went to tag my carry on duffel ... a brand new Louis Vuitton keepall, my husband was like nooo. That's not a roll away and can we at least see if it fits, don't really want it thrown around in cargo. Again the nicest( no really nice) woman said yes you can check but I'll tag it just in case but we are sold out. We walk down the corridor to get on my husband hands his bag to a gentleman and the gentleman grabbed my bag and said it's tagged I cannot allow it past this point! My husband said no, we were told he walked the plane and there was zero space for it, so my husband said I'll check and also got the woman up front to call him and say she authorized us to check and he grabbed my bag out of my hand and said I'm a supervisor and I'm over riding her there is no room! So reluctantly I handed over my bag and got on the plane... so much space above it was ridiculous!! All of the passengers in the back of the plane were astonished! Also there were about 10 open seats!!! We managed to sit next to each other, had a nice flight after all the stress and finally arrived in California at 6:30, after getting to airport at 1:15 missing a 2:06 flight. Got our luggage from baggage claim and of course my brand new bag was damaged! We have flown AA every time very loyaly and with each issue they have done nothing to make up for it and I am finally leaving a review and I will be calling when we get home because the whole situation from the beginning was unacceptable! Going to enjoy my amazing beach trip first! Happy Mother's Day to me!?",negative
Today on 4-26-2018 i had a confirmed flight and seat assignment on a connecting flight from Phoenix to Burbank and somehow i and most of the passengers don't have seats available. WTF??? Why reserve and pay for a flight only to get to the gate for them too say you don't have a seat because we have a smaller plane. How exactly is that my problem? Perhaps you should have had the correct plane flying today??! Highly inconvenient. Greedy inconsiderate bastards. Shame on you. You make me ashamed of being American.,negative

"Absolute asshole at the front gate made me check by bag because the wheels were passed a yellow line for a personal item. There was PLENTY of overhead space and my bag was 18 by 14, the flight is not even full and they still made me check my bag and charged me twice the rate $50 instead of $25. I am livid and the service was so horrible. Would never fly again.",negative
"I am done with American Airlines. I was hesitant to book my most recent flight with AA because I had prior business trip where they canceled the last leg of my flight. I really needed to get to my destination and every person I spoke with took the position that it was a ""me problem."" As you can understand, I came into the most recent flight with the opinion that AA's customer service left a lot to be desired. After my last trip, I find their customer service to be non-existent. We booked a round-trip NYC to Tucson because they offered non-stop service. Mind you, this was the ONLY reason I chose AA. A few months later, the flight was changed to include a change of planes in each direction. When it came time to check in, the seats we were given were terrible. Yet every other seat cost extra. So, we laid out an extra $300 for seats on top of what we paid for non-stop flights that were no longer occurring. On the day of flying out, we got to the airport well ahead of our departure. We opted not to spend the extra $35 a person to get ""priority"" check in. This meant we did not get to go into the line where there was six associates checking people in. Instead, we were with a larger group and only two associates. So, if you love classism, AA is the airline for you. The associate who finally checked us in was moving so slow, she was traveling backwards through time and getting younger. Flight from JFK to Phoenix had a crew where one person actually seemed to care about the passengers' experience and the rest of the crew just enjoyed gossiping. Crew from Phoenix to Tucson were fine, but it's a twenty-minute flight, which is hard to foul up. Flight back: 6:20 a.m. TSA tells passengers to get to the airport two hours before your flight. AA seems to be unaware of this recommendation because their check-in desk didn't open much later. Oddly, every other airline's desks were open for their passengers getting up at the crack of dawn. Not even the illustrious ""priority"" desk was open -- glad we saved some money there. Flight from Tucson to Dallas was actually decent: entertainment modules for each seat, crew that didn't seem to despise their existence, etc. We got to our gate in Dallas late and thanks to idiot planning by AA we had less than an hour to take the tram to a different terminal to get our plane from Dallas to JFK. Flight from Dallas to JFK was much longer than from Tucson to Dallas, but there were no entertainment modules, which makes absolutely no sense at all. Crew did the bare minimum and nothing more. As I typed when I started this post, I am done with American Airlines. Even if the AA fare is 2,000.00 less expensive, I will not book another flight with them. Ever.",negative
"Not flying AA anymore, on June 19th we had a 4:30pm flight to Orange County. We boarded and de-boarded 3 different times, flight cancelled around midnight. I was at airport from 3pm to after midnight, they said to come back the next morning at 6am and they would put me on another flight. The next morning, I got a flight at 8am, it cancelled, got another flight at 9;30, boarded and de-boarded, stood in line each time to get a new ticket. Finally, we flew out after 11:30 am almost 24 hrs. later. They gave me a $200 voucher and I told them that was ridiculous after spending the night at the airport, missing my flight and meeting the next day as well as a hotel room that I paid for! They gave me another $50 credit, I told them to keep it - I'm done with AA!",negative
I'm a frequent flyer and usually try to not write bad reviews... but for AA I'll make an exception... this is THE WORST airlines I have ever flown flown with period.... there is ALWAYS delays if you have something important planned DO NOT use this airline you won't make it!!!

"We booked our flight with AA months ahead of time for our family of 5. Our seats were booked together with our younger children however AA moved our seats when they altered our flight leave time. Our travel agent went thru several channels to get our families seats together without success. COME ON AA AN 8 YEAR OLD CANT SIT BY HIMSELF ON THE PLANE nor should a 10 year old. Our return Flight was a straight flight from Cancun to Phoenix and when we went to grab our bags off the baggage carousel, my 13 yr old daughters suitcase was opened up, and items were missing out of her suitcase including ray bans, cash and makeup. AA SECURITY guy instructed us to chat with AA baggage however we then got told to go to ticketing however supervisor had no idea who we needed to talk to and informed us that AA uses a third party for all their luggage in Mexico therefore there wouldn't be much they could do.

"Wow American Airlines...first time and only time we will use this airlines. 5 delays equaling about 9 hours. Only to tell us it's because the pilots can't fly due to their flight contract.

If customers don't choose AA in the future, they also will be dealing with it.",negative
"I've flown American Airlines into Phoenix several times this summer, which hasn't been much of an issue. However, departing Phoenix on American Airlines has been quite shitty. Delays every time, and one day, my plane had to turn back for emergency landing (which ultimately wasn't emergency but there was an issue with the plane). That turned into a 3 hour delay and then we got into a plane after that, and sat in for an hour because we had to turn back from the runway to get a light fixed in the Cockpit. I've come to find that I highly regret using American Airlines. Look for SouthWest, JetBlue, Delta, etc.. All have better quality maintenance on their planes, and rarely get delayed.",negative
American Airlines has horrible customer service at Sky Harbor. They have 13 agents doing nothing at priority check in and one gentleman working his butt off at the general boarding section to check bags. We had an issue with printing tags and was told by the the gentleman he wasn't even supposed to be here. Several customers asked to have more help. Eventually they brought in one person who promptly left to walk around the kiosk. I asked and saw several people ask for assistance and none was given.,negative

Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal but, for the first time in my life, I had paid for a first class upgrade and the new plane I am getting on doesn't have a first class section. I asked if they would refund my money then and the person at the gate said that I was going to have to go get in line at the customer service desk near the McDonald's or call their customer service line and ask for a refund. Seriously? I paid extra so that I can go stand in line and deal with their customer service reps? This is ridiculous. Literally, as I am writing this, the lady behind the gate just told me that I have no choice and I have to do what they tell me if I want to get the refund. They refuse to do anything to help.",negative

"I don't normally bash on companies or people but American Airlines has the worst customer service. Please note that if you ever speak with a La Tonia Minge over the phone, you will never get your issue resolved. I had a flight in December that I cancelled and had to pay $200 for the cancellation fee. I still had $200 left over on credit and had a year to use it. I called in June to book a flight to use my remaining credit but was told that I was unable to do so because I didn't give them an evoucher. Complete bullshit because I provided them with my voucher # but they couldn't do it because of their policy (they wanted the evoucher and not just the voucher number). I then booked my flight with southwest because I was over their bullshit already. Plus, I didn't know how long it would take for them to send me the voucher through the mail or email. Somehow communication was lost and it never got resolved. I contacted them recently to tell them that I never received the voucher and if I could use that remaining credit before it was expired. Turns out it expired 2 weeks ago and I can't use the credit anymore even though I never received my voucher!!! La Tonia Minje also said I only had a little over $30 left in credit which was a complete lie. I know I have $213 left in credit. Basically I lost $400 to American Airlines when I paid for a $200 cancellation fee including my credit. I will never fly with them again. They are complete assholes and will find any way to take your money whether it is: paying an additional $50 to book your flight over the phone, paying for bags to be checked in, or paying for a damn $200 cancellation fee. Some flights aren't even that expensive! If you can, fly with SOUTHWEST. They let you use whatever credit you have with them and do not make you pay a $200 fee to use your leftover credit.

"The staff at their Phoenix airport are exceptionally rude; I was let onto the walkway going to the plane and right before boarding I was physically stopped by a women whose name tag said ""Kathi P"", she proceeded to curtly tell me that there is no more room for carry-on in the cabin, I showed her that my carry on is regulation size and I never check baggage anymore because their airline has previously lost my baggage entirely, additionally, my carry on fits under my seat, which is how I traveled with it on my connecting flight to Phoenix. She proceeded to loudly tell me ""no, no, no"", then as I asked to prove to her that it fit under my seat and would check the bag if it didn't, she proceeded to move her hand in front of her mouth making a talking motion with it and summarily saying ""end of discussion, end of discussion"". The only other option she rudely offered me was on the next day and she said that might not even happen, so I checked my bag and stepped into the plane; while looking for my seat I was pulled off the plane by a short man with a small beard who had no name tag, but I assume was her supervisor, he restarted the discussion about the bag after I had already moved on and when I explained my logic informed me that ""how long ago did we lose your luggage, 6 months ago? get over it."" Amazingly, there was more than enough room in the overhead bin for my carry on and an empty seat next to me as well.",negative

"America's Worst Value Inn... my wife choose this place based on the price, location to our event and the fact that it had a pool to relax in in the searing Phoenix heat. This turned out to be a really, really, really bad mistake. First, we find out that the pool was closed by the state, then our friends in another room had roaches climbing up their walls, the carpet was EXTREMELY dirty but the real problem was the next day. We came back from our event to a blackout... the electricity in the entire building was out. It was Pitch black on the entire grounds. We waited a bit then went to front office to see what was going on but to our shock the entire staff had left!!! (I have video of it) No one to let us know the status of the blackout or no note! It was baffling that a company would just abandon their hotel and guests with no explanation! We waited and waited but no one came.. after awhile i noticed a guy circling the building on a bike. I walked around the corner of the building to see what this guy was doing and i realized he was 5 feet from me pearing into a car. As soon as he saw me he bolted. Thats when i realized that we just had to go. It was just too dangerous to be waiting around for the lights to go on. At the very least they could have left a note or called a security company to watch over the area and inform guests about the status of the electricity. Nope.. they just chose to abandon the hotel and leave us to figure it out. Around midnight we decided to make the 6 hour drive back home instead of waiting around in the dark... avoid this place!",negative
"Falls short of what you'd expect for the $60/night I paid. (A banner above the entrance claims rooms are $39/night). The room was spartan but decent. Lumpy pillows. Small, thin towels. Room has refrig, microwave, hairdryer and very slow WiFi that freezes altogether with regularity. No coffee maker. Ancient TV with poor picture quality and only local channels. Ice machine did not produce ice. Breakfast is instant oatmeal, danish, fruits, juices. Their reservation system is badly flawed. When I checked in they couldn't find my reservation even though I had a confirmation e-mail and a reminder e-mail from when I reserved online through their own site. The neighborhood is a bit run down with scattered Latino businesses and vagrants. I'll try to book somewhere else for that price next time.",negative
"Taylor was such a great person to have piloting our balloon!! He was funny, yet did a great job explaining as we went what everything did and what was coming next. My first hot air balloon ride experience was so magical because of him!!",positive
"That was awesome! We had a wonderful time on the Sunrise Champagne Toast Ride. Taylor and his crew were very friendly, especially for 530am.",positive
"Our guide Taylor was so nice!!!! We all met at Dunkin Donuts in the parking lot at 6:45AM, from there about 16 of us piled into vans and we went on a 15 minute drive out to the desert. We were in the air for an hour and five minutes, and flew about 6 miles total! It was a once in a lifetime experience, so incredible! They even had mimosas at the end. Would recommend!",positive
"Our trip with Taylor was amazing! He was an awesome pilot and knew a lot about the area. You could tell that him and his team were organized and professional. The views were gorgeous, especially the sunrise. Another couple on the balloon got engaged on the ride and you could tell Taylor had taken extra time and energy to make it really special for them. I highly recommend!",positive
"I highly recommend choosing this company for your hot air balloon ride. We had a great experience from start to finish. We went with a group of 12 others that we did not know. Taylor, the tour guide made us all feel comfortable even though we did not know each other. Taylor was professional, funny, and shared a wealth of knowledge about not only ballooning but flying and the land below. The sunset was to die for and the view of the entire area was breathtaking. We were a bit nervous but the take off and landing was flawless. Not only did we check this off of our bucket list, but we also enjoyed the experience with an amazing company and people. We'll be back!",positive
"Great guys, awesome ride. My mom and little sister love it, would recommend this is one of those to do list things. Make sure to take your GoPro for great pics",positive
"We had the best time on our balloon ride! The flight crew all had great personalities and were a ton of fun, and the flight was truly amazing. I give the highest recommendations! Great way to start our day!",positive
My girlfriend and I went on a private chartered sunset cruise. Everything was perfect! Thanks for everything Taylor! We appreciate you taking pictures and even recording the proposal for us too!,positive
"Took my first hot air balloon ride with Pilot Taylor at sunrise on March 13. Wow!! Well done, Taylor. Perfect ride, perfect day, perfect liquid Arizona Sunrise at the finish. Couldn't have had a better first ride.",positive
This is the second time I've used this tour group. I hosted an unconventional bachelorette party with the sip and sample tour and it was fantastic. They were able to accommodate our party of 15 with last-minute additions!,positive
Amazing tour and guide! Delicious food! We did lunch next time definitely would try the dinner tour! A must do! Thank you Lindsey!,positive
"My boyfriend and I have a group of 10 close friends, including ourselves. I wanted to do something fun and different to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday so I signed us and our friends up for the Sip 'n Sample tour. We had an absolute blast! Lindsey (sorry if I spelled that wrong!) was great. She was knowledgeable, personable, funny, and put up with our group of crazies. It was such a fun experience. We all are from Arizona and live so close to Old Town Scottsdale yet had never been to some of the places and certainly never heard the history behind the city/restaurants. I would recommend Arizona Food Tours a million times! Thank you for such a wonderful day!",positive
"We had a great time on our tour!! The food was great, the company was awesome and our guide executed everything perfectly! Favorite foods: Stetson salad and the BBQ from bootleggers!",positive
"Arizona Food Tours is a must when traveling in Scottsdale, Arizona. We did the progressive dinner tour and wow was it amazing. The portions were huge with alcoholic beverage pairings. It was perfectly timed and our guide Jason was knowledgeable and friendly. We were encouraged to mingle with others participating in the tour which made it even more special. The price point is almost unbelievable considering the amount of food, drinks, and places we got to experience. Do not hesitate to book your tour, you will not regret it!",positive
"I have taken guests to enjoy this food tour a number of times and each time it gets even better! Hard to believe, but Zach (the co-owner and our guide) continues to learn more history and gain more enthusiasm each time. He seems to truly enjoy what he does. I would highly recommend this tour. It's thoroughly enjoyable. Alice Katz",positive
"We try and do a food tour on every vacation since we discovered them a few years ago (this was our 10th I believe) because they are just such a great way to get to know the city. This tour was no exception. Our guide, Zach (also the co-owner of the company) was outstanding. It is easy to see how much he cares about his job and he truly puts a lot of effort into making sure everyone is happy. We had 5 delicious stops, which to my understanding are not always the same stops. Favorites were the tacos at the old Mission church and the ice cream sundaes for dessert. The portions on this tour were extremely generous (not too much, Zach, don't change anything! :) ) I would love to do the progressive dinner or the happy hour tour if I ever went back. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone! Great way to see old town Scottsdale! Thanks Zach!",positive
"Excellent lunchtime food tour in Old Town Scottsdale! As a general rule, we love food tours. Combining local cuisine and history is the perfect pairing for any vacation. This tour was no exception. Our tour guide and company co-owner, Zach, selected 5 delicious stops in Old Town, and he was enthusiastically knowledgeable about the restaurants and the local history. We enjoyed ceviche, pork tacos, elote, bacon-wrapped water chestnuts, bacon cheeseburger sliders, moonshine, pork nachos and ice cream Sundays for dessert. The restaurants were well prepared for our group of 10, and we received excellent service at each location. All restaurants quickly and seamlessly accommodated requests for additional cocktail and beer purchases. We completed the lunch tour surprisingly full and satisfied. Very well organized tour with lots of great culinary and historical info! Dedicated and entertaining tour guide! We also noticed that they offer progressive dinner tours, as well as happy hour tours! I definitely recommend checking out Arizona Food Tours if you're in the area!",positive
"My first ""food tour"" experience exceeded my expectations in two ways: 1. Our guide, Zach, was very well-acquainted with state and local history and trivia, pointing out things in the architecture as we toured around Scottsdale. Lots of interesting information. (Although he said some source reported Metro Phoenix was now the 5th largest metro area in the US, which I dispute: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas#United_States) 2. On a food tour you eat adventurous things that you might immediately rule out if you were ordering off a menu. I'm not a big fan of risotto, but at Evo we were served a fried ball of parmesan risotto that was delicious. At the same restaurant, we had a salad made up of desiccated kale, flash-fried Brussels sprouts, pancetta, pear, and goat cheese. One of the most unique tastes and textures I've ever tried. I never would have picked it off a menu, and yet it was wonderful.",positive
We had a wonderful tour on Sunday with Justin! We made a spur of the moment decision to take the tour and they were happy to accommodate us on short notice. The places were visited were all great and so different from each other and all had amazing food and stories.,positive
"Had a great time with friends while visiting Scottsdale. Second time on the lunch food tour with Zach as our guide. What a nice guy...... Very personable, knowledgeable about the chefs, food and the city itself. 5 very different stops, great portions and happy to visit a few places we have always been interested in. Highly recommend, wear your stretchy pants. Linda",positive
"Our guide crystal was great, super fun and knowledgeable, she deserves 5 stars but 3 stars for the food, disappointing variety but did come out in a efficient manner and was hot. As a group we expected more from the food choices as a food tour of scottsdale arizona. It was mainly ok bar food you can find anywhere (one dry chili slider, one great street taco and chips, ok cup of sour thai soup and tiny spring roll, bleh fried pickles, bread with italian toppings, glass of sangria, and 3 good cookies). One of the stops we didn't even eat any of it besides the initial try. My group left the tour thinking it was a good walk around but what's special about the food here? Not sure if the restaurants need to step up their game or if they need to pick better places to represent especially for the price of the tour.",negative
"I was a bit worried at first when I found out this was a 3 hour tour. Fortunately, it was not on a boat, but a 3 hour walking/dining tour in Downtown Tempe (DT). We learned the area, formally known as Mill, is now called downtown Tempe from our knowledgeable tour guide Zach who guided us on our culinary journey through 5 dining establishments. If you like to eat and make new friends along the way, this food tour is for you. Highly Recommended.",positive
"Took our lunch tour with Crystal. What a great way to spend an afternoon. Crystal was informative about the history of downtown Scottsdale, answered all our questions and was so attentive that she made us feel like we were the only clients there. She made sure a couple in our group avoided food allergies. All of the stops were just right, small bite, perfect mix of walking/eating time and the food was delish. Nice variety, left you feeling well fed but not over fed. Would definitely do again and definitely recommend.",positive
"Did the lunch tour over the Christmas break. There were four of us, we two, now locals, and two guests from California. Great tour. Highly recommend. Food was good, great information about the area. We have already gone back to a couple of the restaurants, and never disappointed. Great for guests and locals alike. Would do again if we have visitors.",positive
Crystal was our guide on a small tour and she was great! Such a nice way to explore old town and food at every stop was phenomenal!,positive
"Took my mom on the food tour through Scottsdale for her birthday. We both had a blast! Zach was our guide and he killed it. Super knowledgeable, not only about the restaurants and their history/food, but also about the city of Scottsdale itself. Every stop we made, there was amazing food waiting for us. It seemed like the restaurants were very happy that we were there. Can't wait to try their ""Dinner"" and ""Happy Hour"" tours in the future!",positive
"Bar none, 5 stars! Excellent food tour. Crystal, our tour guide was very knowledgeable, professional, and excited to show us what Scottsdale what has to offer for us ""food lovers."" As well as little tidbits of history and unknown facts and history of the town. The details of each place we went to were thoroughly explained; the history of the restaurant, which type of fare, the chefs, and what goes into making these establishments so awesome! I highly recommend Arizona Food Tours on your next visit to Scottsdale. Weather you are a history buff, foodie, want to learn about Scottsdale's culture, its all in this tour. You will not be dissapointed.",positive
"Crystal was our guide and she was incredible. This is the second time my husband and I have done the food tour and both times were amazing! First was last year when we were in Scottsdale for work, and then again this year while in town for a birthday celebration. Crystal was our guide the first time and I requested her again for this trip. Funny, sweet, and full of wonderful and interesting facts about Old Town. She made the tour memorable! The restaurants were fantastic and we were completely stuffed at the end of the three hour tour. I highly recommend using Arizona Food Tour for a different and unique experience.",positive
"Our tour was rained on, but Zach our guide, quickly improvised to accommodate, so the entire tour went on without a hitch. We sampled 5 stops. We enjoyed all stops except for the Thai spot. As a matter of fact, my husband, cousin and I ended up having a full dinner one night later at one of the spots, Bootleggers. The brisket nachos were top notch! We are hard core, meat-loving Texans, so the bar is high when it comes to bbq, but Bootleggers did not disappoint with their dry-rubbed bbq meats. I'm surprised by the high marks for the Thai spot. Our guide showcased the restaurant as one of the older restaurant landmarks in Scottsdale, as it's been around for 27 years. The 3 samples we tried were all extremely sweet and a little on the greasy side. Thai food is known for their spice and sour qualities. All 3 samples did not mirror Thai food. The positive: the generous pour of wine helped alleviate the disappointment on the food. All-in-all, this tour is a great touristy thing to do. Since we were first-time tourists, this food walk fits the bill.",positive
This is a must do for anyone whether you are a visitor or a resident. Our tour guide walked us to several wonderful restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Not too long of a walk - just enough. At each place we sampled whatever the restaurant wanted to feed us. It was all wonderful and filling. Great wines and other beverages too. Even dessert! Brought some great friends and met some wonderful new friends! Would definitely do this again!!,positive
"Not just for tourists... A fabulous girls night out or date night event! A girlfriend invited me to do a food tour in Old Town Scottsdale, which is where I live and was pretty sure I knew most of the ""hot spots"" and ate there often... I was wrong! I had a fabulous time learning about some great hidden gems right here in my backyard. The tour was great, the guide (Zach) was fantastic! We met a few new locals and tourists. All in all it was a fun experience and a MUST DO when we have out of town guests! I would totally recommend it for tourists and locals. I will certainly be back to at least 3 of the 5 restaurants that we sampled!",positive
"Had a small group, and our guide (Zach) did a great job planning out our stops and sharing a lot of good history and information. We enjoyed the variety of foods (and there was a lot of it!) and types of restaurants. This is a great activity while just visiting Scottsdale, or for locals who don't want to miss out on some of the excellent places to eat in the area.",positive
"I live in Old Town Scottsdale and took my grandma who was visiting for the first time on this tour. We had such a great afternoon together! Our guide, Zack, was very knowledgeable about the history of Scottsdale and the restaurants on the tour. He even pushed my grandmas wheelchair the whole time and had her up front so she didn't miss out on any of the sights and didn't feel left out. The restaurants all provided great samples of their signature dishes as well as take home menus and info about all of their specials and current deals and promotions. I would highly recommend this tour for first time visitors or scottsdale veterans!",positive
"This is an excellent tour for both locals and out of towners. I first went on the tour when I was visiting Scottsdale (still living in Pittsburgh). We visited 5 restaurants and 1 specialty shop. I was so impressed with the Old Town area. The food was outstanding! The tour taught me about the area and taught me some history as well. When I officially moved to Scottsdale, I did the tour again (a different version than the tour I orginally took). It was just as impressive the second time around! I know take all my out of town friends on a Taste of Old Town Tour!",positive
"We had a full group of 18/19 on a Saturday in early March and the weather was perfect. Zach was a great tour guide, he was laid back but also very knowledgeable about Sedona and the area's restaurants. This tour is a good intro to the city as you hit the main ""districts"" throughout the walk, and it's easy to spot places you might want to return to. All of the food was great, and it was well worth the time. Great job!",positive
"This was a long overdue Christmas gift that we finally cashed in this past weekend. All in all, it was a great experience. Although I've lived in AZ for 14 years, some of the history in Scottsdale was interesting. We chose to turn it into something of a pub crawl which MAY have added to our enjoyment. The staff at each stop were very welcoming and inviting. They also did a great job (mostly) of getting our drinks to us quickly. At times, it felt a little rushed but I understand that our tour guide was having to herd cats from one location to the next. I am definitely interested in doing the dinner tour sometime.",positive
"This was my 2nd tour with this group and it was just as fantastic as the 1st one. My parents came into town from NM and I knew this would be a great way to spend the day - Great food, great company and enjoy a beautiful AZ day. I recommend this tour to everyone in or out of state. Ask for Zach to be your tour guide, he is the best.",positive
"This is a great way to sample food and learn about the history of Old Town Scottsdale. It is a walking tour (more of a stroll), so it is not strenuous at all. Cody was our tour guide. She was very knowledgeable about the local history and has a terrific personality. The Stetson Salad at Cowboy Caio was incredible. The olive oils and vinegars at Outrageous Olive Oils were terrific.",positive
"My boyfriend and I went on this tour while visiting family over Thanksgiving and it was SO fun! I had never been to Scottsdale before so I was really excited to learn a little more about the history of the town. Every place that we went to had its own Scottsdale flair and the food at each place was totally unique. AZ88 was a standout for me. The dining room was beautiful and we got to eat tasty, fresh ceviche (which is one of my faves), as well as a bunch of other really nice appetizers. Zach, our guide, was knowledgeable and fun and shared interesting facts and info throughout the tour. He did a really good job of making sure that everyone was having a great time. I would definitely recommend going on this tour. It's a wonderful way to spend time with your fam in the sunshine while eating delicious food. There's nothing better, right?",positive
"The manager at this location, ""Karen"" is extremely unethical, rude and unprofessional. I've rented Budget Trucks multiple times, even driving across the country twice with them, and I've never had as bad of an experience as I did with this lady. They will try to con you into purchasing their expensive CDW insurance coverage by telling you that you have to have your own CDW insurance if you're not going to purchase theirs, or you cannot rent a truck. This is NOT Budget's corporate policy, you can simply sign a waiver and take full responsibility for the truck. I'm guessing this ""manager"" cons people into purchasing their insurance because she gets a bonus for doing so. I called their corporate office right in front of the management and employees of this store for clarification on the insurance policy (which they confirmed, you don't have to buy their coverage) and they refused to talk to them. Then, the corporate office called the store directly and the manager LIED and said the reason I didn't have a truck was because she rented all of them. This was blatantly false because I had been sent from another store that morning specifically because this location had a truck for me. Karen should be fired immediately, she's a horrible representative for any company.",negative
"Stick with Uhaul!!! I had the worst experience here this past Sunday! Super unprofessional, they did not even open on time. I believe they are under new management and she is cocky and sassy at best. If I could rate it negative stars I would.",negative
"This 'business' could not be worse if they tried which I think she did. My reservation was for 6pm, got there at 5:50 And was immediately yelled at that I needed to leave since she was closed. I told her that I had a reservation for 6 and she said I should have gotten there earlier and I needed to leave since it took her 10 minutes to close her system. I said I need the car to drive to my own wedding and she said 'that's nice, I have to get to my daughter's game' I then said in the time we've argued you could have just done the car and she ignored me and wouldn't respond like I wasn't even there. She then told me she was calling the cops since I was refusing to leave. This woman needs to be fired immediately. Such a disgrace of a business.",negative
"Horrible from the start!!! If I could give no stars I would. We walked on and were greeted with a ""you can have a seat it's going to be a while!"" No hello or otherwise pleasant greeting. After she finished her customer which wasn't long at all, she just disappeared into the back of the building on what looked to be a smoke break. ( the door was open to see clear to the rear of the building) I waited 10-15 minutes before I got up to ring the bell. She sachets out and says ""License, proof of insurance, and method of payment"", no thank you for your patience, no apology for her abruptness prior. I stepped out to retrieve the insurance document only to come back and she was gone yet again from the desk, just left outside and left no explanation with my husband who was the renter. When she came back, she processed the documents and payment presumably and then goes on to say "" y'all can sit down anyway cuz I gotta go clean the car!"" I'm am writing this during my second wait and I haven't even left the building yet and I felt that this ignorance and unprofessional behavior could not go undocumented. Im just waiting to get her name to put a name to this photo. I don't want it to be mistaken as to who this person was that this company has in their employ. She just walked backed in flopped some documents and key on the desk and said ""sign here!"", as she sang to the song on the radio. My husband asked regarding the dirty car she brought with someone's glasses clearly on the drivers seat she just got out of and she just replied that's it. Never again with this company just based on the actions of Karen Alexander.",negative
"Horrible customer service!! First off, I didn't get acknowledged when I walked in the door. I looked around and the lobby had three customers waiting already and the female at the desk was on the phone. I figured she is pretty busy she might be having technical difficulties and is calling to get help, ah NO! This so called Budget representative was on a personal phone call. "" Hey baby I miss you .. love you. What did you guys have for breakfast, yeah I'll be off at 345 pm"" etc etc.. you get the point. I was able to switch my reservation to another location and she was still on this personal call. I can't express how upset I still am! Not only was my move delayed, but I had to drive out of the way to go pick up another truck. All this over someone who shouldn't be working in customer service.",negative
Hands down worst car rental place in the WORLD! Very unprofessional. Have their kids working there actually doing a better job than the adults. Assumes clients owe them. Remember and don't forget why you have this job. Customer Service is not like it use to be. My advice would be not to do business with this particular location off Harris BLVD.,negative
"The worst ever. Stay away. Do not use this car rental. Go to the airport but don't use it. It is listed as Avis/Budget. The truck was dirty no cleaning options onsite, the truck was in an accident and I found out when I got home to put my luggage in the trunk and found the under carriage and other parts of the car in the trunk. Unbelievable ! Then I call customer service to get the issue resolved and that was also worthless. These people are not dependable and ruined my trip plans for not providing any service or resolution to try and help fix the problem of neglect. They were not aware the care was in an accident and fortunately my family didn't get in an unsafe car on a 7 hour trip. And the sad point is the Avis customer service idiot kept asking me what did I want them to do?? He did offer for me to keep the car and until I could locate another or call roadside assistance for a replacement but THEY were not willing to help find another vehicle for me. I wanted to get the car I reserved, take my family on the trip I paid for... not argue on a call for more than an hour with no resolution. I returned the car immediately. A complete disaster! Thank you Avis for ruining my day and family trip.",negative
"I came here after booking a truck to rent online the day before. I came on time and i saw the manager just sitting in the store like she was a customer. They had 7 trucks outside just sitting there. The girl told me that her system was down and budget had no trucks for rent in the hold city of charlotte. I did not receive a phone or email about this error. Any one that have moved before know how stressful moving can be and the last thing you want to think about is a rental truck. I had to call budget customer service for help because the manager did not care about my time . C.S told me to give the manager the phone and see if she could do a manual override she told them No! she does not have any paper. I left and went to u Haul and got a truck with no problem at all. but was told it would be about 2 hours before someone call me where to get a truck so one of the manager of budget call me to give me a truck the truck was in a different city not even charlotte, I declined to drive almost 30 mins for a truck. Where i was driving too was already an 3 hours away .The most unprofessional business i been to in charlotte Nc by far.",negative
"Rented a truck from here when I moved from Charlotte. I reserved the truck online. When I got there, the people they have working there are some questionable characters. Not exactly the epitome of customer service. The guy who helped me kind of brushed off some of my question. My experience was pretty quick and simple. But at the end they just hand you the keys and tell you to ""find the truck with the same number"" that are all parked in the back of the parking lot. How about you walk yourself out to the back of the parking lot and make note of which truck is which? For me when it comes to customer service, it's the little things that make the most difference. The people they hire are people you can tell are just there to collect a paycheck and do as little as possible.",negative
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Worked with Budget Rep: BRITTANY at BCR off Harris Blvd, Charlotte NC. I work with Allstate auto claims and attempted to set up rental for my insured driver and was unable to because there was not a reservation set up (Allstate had set a reservation up previous in the day and had re-confirmed this during the call with Brittany). I was astounded at her rude attitude toward me and completely frustrated that she couldn't set a rental up and wouldn't because a reservation wasn't set up. Requested her to set up a rental for our customer a second time and she stated ""that's what I initially said to do, yes i'll get the rental set up"" I have never had any worse customer experience than with this woman. First, she did not say to do this once during our conversation. Second, that's no way to speak to someone you are servicing. In attempt to reach a manager in the area I spoke with the manager at the aiport location and requested the name of the branch manager on Harris Blvd. He state ""I don't have that information i could send you to corporate but its already 5PM and they probably won't answer or be of any help"" Seriously Budget? This is how you request your employees to handle customers and other companies working with your customers? I am very happy that Allstate uses Enterprise day-to-day and suggest anyone wishing to use Budget rental to look elsewhere.",negative
This place is the worst. My mom had a 4:00 appointment to pick up a car. Got there at 4:05 at the door was locked and all the lights were off. They have a very small selection of cars so you'd think they would care when someone is actually reserving one to pick up. We then had to drive all the way to McCarran Airport (on the other side of town if you don't know) and pick up a car there. AND THEN they charged a $25 service fee for dropping the car off at a different location. Absolutely ridiculous. Scam artist action right there. The real icing on the cake was when they wanted $10.00/gallon to return the car without being filled up. I recently rented a car in CALIFORNIA and only paid $5.55/gallon to return. And for reference gas is quite a bit more expensive there. K bye never getting our business again.,negative
"From start to finish, one of the best Car rental places I've ever been too.. Fast, friendly and accommodating. They helped me, per recommendation from another Avis Rent a Car I usually go to and I was just as impressed with their service as I am with my friends at the other location.. Very personable and professional.. Highly recommended!!",positive
David is freaking awesome ! ... he helped me and my family get a 12 passenger van to Long Beach with no hesitation! It was SO easy! AVIS in long beach would never compare to the Avis out here in Vegas. THANKS AGAIN DAVID!,positive
So far I have only reserved my car but the service delivered thus far has been beyond superior. They have gone out of their way to assist and answer questions. This makes vacation planning even better.,positive
Rented a car for a week while company borrowed my car. They were easy to deal with. I was in and out both when I picked up the vehicle and when I returned. I would rent from here again if the price is right. I used COSTCO travel to book the car.,positive
"I was not able to rent at this location due to a lack of vehicles available at the time, but the gentlemen working the desk took time to reach out to other offices to assist in looking for a local office close by that could accommodate us.",positive
"My car was in the Shop at Desert Oasis European Auto Repair (which I highly recommend) which is about a block away, so I decided to try AVIS, DAVID ARGUELLO & his staff took great care of me. They will work with your warranty company as well. Great location as it's near Summerlin and way closer than the Airport.",positive
"We drove out to California for for my lady birthday and decided to rent a car, which we hadn't done before so I was a bit worried about it. BUUUUUTTTTTT this place was amazing. As soon as you walk in they greet you with the kindest smile and the most amazing attitude that it immediately just made me feel more at ease. Here I am thinking that there were going to try to upsell us on everything but they didn't. They actually worked with us on what kind of car we needed and would be comfortable in then he took the time to show us how everything in the car worked. Dropping the car off was also a piece of cake. We'll come here every time we want to rent a car.",positive
Great place to rent excellent customer service. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this location. When you need to rent a car you could not find a better place,positive
5star service every time. Great cars.. Excellent value.. Speedy service but still personable. :) choose AVIS every time.,positive
Good service super fast..I always used Avis and always been happy. In less than 5 mins you be driving a car. And most of their cars are in really good conditions,positive
"I always rent from here. I had made reservations with budget to go out of town. No where on their website did they say they only went to Cali and Arizona. I go to pick up my car and just mention I'm driving to see my parents. The agent tells me glad I did because their cars don't go to Tennessee. At this time I'm in hysterics because I'm leaving in less than 12 hrs. She offers to help me find another rental place. I'm worried at last minute everything's going to be way too expensive. She calls this Avis location and talks to David, lucky he has a car for me. I rush over to him and explain what happened and the reason I'm going home and he plugs away and he is so sweet to give me a discount my rental ended up being 10 cheaper than my budget rental. Since then I've used then another 4 times and lab on using them again in June. Highly recommended.",positive
Love this place man we rent cars from here probably eight different times they always have good clean cars they're always polite and they don't try and nickel and dime is with a scratch or something like that in the car they're always really cool no worries from renting in here unlike the couple times we've rented from enterprise which was a total fiasco those guys have no clue how to treat their customers yup avis is my place for rent in cars the guy name David behind the counter always takes care of us,positive
This is by far the best Avis location in town. David and George do such a great job and genuinely care about their customers. They help everyone out and have the best customer service. I always refer people to this location because of how wonderful David is!,positive
The sales person upsold me from a generic compact to a Volkswagen Golf. But the Golf ended up smelling like cigarettes. No apologies and no recourse for their terrible cars. Don't rent from this location,negative
"If there was any possible way to rate this place 0 stars I would. Not only are their cars ridiculously over priced, but they are so unorganized and incompetent at doing a menial task it actually boggles the mind. Attempted to rent a car today, all the charges go through on my card and I find my way down to the garage where the cars are located. All seems to be fine, until I find the Avis key pick up station completely empty. After waiting for 5-10 minutes for someone to come, I started waking around looking for someone. I proceeded to walk around the garage to look for them, at this point almost one hour has been used of my rental time and I still have no keys or even an attendant to help me. Finally find an attendant, says he is just a maintenance worker or something but he can help me. He then proceeded to ask me for my contract, told me to wait while someone else brought it down and that I was supposedly given a copy of the contract (the one that the employee never gave to me after I signed it, nor did he indicate I would need a copy for key pickup downstairs). After calling upstairs and asking a couple of people if they had my contract to no avail, he asked me what the person who helped me looked like. 10 minutes later the employee comes down with a new contract, accusing me of losing the contract and that he was essentially doing me a big favour by running down a second set of documents to joyfully sign. At this point I lost it, and proceeded to simultaneously cancel my order and be banned for life from all Avis locations. All in all, just a regular day at this particular location I am sure.",negative
"This is the best rental place in the area. The only problem I've ever had is their so busy. I always get treated well, wonderful customer service, and great vehicles. This is the place I go to first.",positive
"I had a reservation and wanted to change it, problem was all the cars were booked. I called up avis and they said my car will be held for 15 hours so it's no big deal. I goto the location and ask this in person and again, no problem, just show up. So I show up 4 hours after my reservation and the first thing they say is ""your car is gone"". I mentioned the above and the gave me a minivan and charged me an extra $10/day which they didn't communicate well. After returning on time with a full gas tank they wouldn't reconsider the $10/day charge. Told me the manager would call me - he never did. When you pickup the car it's very confusing and difficult due to the system they have down in the basement. It's not signed and far from intuitive. Also, they charge a $10 parking or location fee.",negative
DON'T GO HERE! To make it short: I had a complaint about transparency of their contracts and their sales agents not communicating them. JOSEPH GEBRAYE (store manager) first told me his employees are trained and did communicate them. Then he back stepped and told me he wasn't there and didn't know. Then he told me I lacked common sense and it was my responsibility for asking about such things. I asked them to change my contract before signing it and they said they didn't have to thus charging me for an extra day. He refused to apologize or show empathy for anything and would just smile or laugh at me. I have never complained about service and this is the first time I've ever had to and gotten really upset. You can't spell Avoids without AVIS!!!,negative
"Unbelievably bad service. I rented a compact car here and returned it an hour and a half late, and was charged an entire day, which I was not warned about. The hourly rate amounts to MORE than an entire day with the car. There was no goodwill from the company at the desk - even though it was my first time renting from them AND the parking garage was full of cars not being used. I called customer service and the sales person had the audacity to say that they could charge me the hourly rate instead which would work out to be $70 instead of the $50 I had been charged?!? I will stick to Enterprise from now on.",negative
"This place was very very very filthy. There are cockroaches, linens are absolutely disgusting and even the walls are disturbing. Breakfast isn't open till 7 and for a place that has people staying because of the airport, that time is a huge inconvenience. Can't eat if we have to get to our flight. The only thing they are good for is their shuttle to the airport. And that isn't the best because they are always late. What's the point in reserving a time slot for the shuttle if they aren't on time? Horrible place. Would NEVER recommend for a friend traveling in the Queen City. Horrible one night stay in Charlotte due to this hotel.",negative
This place is absolutely disgusting. A giant roach crawled out of the sink while I was washing my face. Don't believe me see the attached pics,negative
TASHA at the front desk has quite a little nasty attitude on her.. she's rude and unprofessional. I think she's out grown working at a counter. She's short patient and unwilling to provide true customer service...with a smile...room service might be more fitting since she works best alone... can I rate no stars?!,negative
I had to stay here last night because my flight was cancelled. My goodness I did not sleep well at all. The hallways are sketchy and dark plus too wide. There was a gross stain on the floor in the room. The room smelled like a mixture of urine and coffee. Stains on the bed sheets. Worst of all the ceiling vent in the bathroom randomly started leaking for about 30 minutes. Doesn't seem like a safe hotel but offers shuttle bus to the airport which is nice. There was no shampoo bottle. Just 2 conditioner bottles...Overall the hotel seems like it doesn't fix anything or clean anything. It's not difficult to do...Learned my lesson and next time will stay at an upscale hotel,negative
"DON'T STAY HERE! Checked in on Monday January 16, 2017 was assigned to room 224 walked. I asked the attendant if the hotel experienced any rotant or bedbug cases and was assure they hadn't. We walked into the room and immediately noticed that floor hadn't been properly vacuumed due to the white pieces of debris in front of the bed. After getting settled in from a long 10 hour drive I walked in the bathroom to take a shower and notice that vent over the shower was hanging about 2 inches from the ceiling and toilet seat had red residue near the front seat. I proceeded to wipe the seat before using it. Gross! While sleeping I felt a something bothering my face, after tossing for a bit I woke up about 1am and went to use the bathroom and looked at at my face.To my surprise I had been bitten. My right eye was clearly swollen from a bite and itching like crazy. I immediately went down to the front desk and told went happened and asked another room. Was told that it (the situation) was nothing and the room was fine. After a some back and forth he gave me a different room. Headed back up and packed up our things moved to room 335. I couldn't sleep after the whole upsetting ordeal. We tried to watch some tv to somewhat numb what just took place but it wouldn't turn on. Frustrated by yet another thing on wrong I tried to get some sleep but could for fear of being attacked again by a rodent. Next morning I checked out ask for the manager was told by the attendant that she wasn't sure when the manager was going to come in. I asked for a receipt noticed some weird transactions on the bill. I viewed my credit card and noticed that I had been charged $126.22 and $77.22. I should only been charged $77.22 for the room and $50 deposit for a total of $127.22 one time. End result..it took numerous phone calls to get the manager on the phone. The charge was cleared up by my credit card company. Allegedly there was nothing found after inspection.",negative
Dated looking hallways and carpet. Up to date decor in the rooms. Beds are comfortable and the things that matter in the bathroom are clean.,negative
One star because the bed was decent and Yelp doesn't low anything lower. Everything else was absolutely awful. Bad breakfast. Bad carpet. Small outdated bathroom. Broken coffee pot. Loud halls. I didn't book this hotel. It was the only thing available when I got in a travel pinch and now I know why.,negative
"Our flight was cancelled and we were stuck in Charlotte for the night, without luggage or a friendly face... We got a discount coupon for the Baymont Inn near the airport and headed there. Big mistake. The smoke-filled lobby was grimy and dimly lit. The man in line behind us at the front desk was carrying only a suitcase of beer. It did not inspire confidence. The Front Desk Manager gave us the key to a room on the first floor. In fact, it was the very first room, just beyond the lobby and the blaring TV. With a hard push, we opened the door and closed it again right away. An outside light was shining in the window, almost blinding us. On top of that, the noise from the television and the smoke from the lobby prompted us to ask for a different room. The man with the suitcase of beer gave us a dirty look because he had not yet been waited on and here we were asking for a different room. I turned toward him and smiled, and said, ""Sorry. And thanks"" He sort of smiled back. With a new key in hand and higher hopes, we took the elevator to the second floor. When we stepped off the elevator we could hear the distinctive chirp of a smoke alarm in need of a new battery. I was hoping that when we closed the door of our room we wouldn't hear the noise anymore. Unfortunately, we soon discovered that the smoke alarm in need of the new battery was in OUR new room. Unacceptable. Back at the front desk, we were given the keys for a third room. When we opened the door, a cloud of cigarette smoke hit us in the face despite the No Smoking sign on the door. Three strikes and the Baymont Inn & Suites was out. After some pleading with the travel voucher company because the room was considered pre-paid, they agreed to refund our money. Stay somewhere else. Period.",negative
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! This place is absolutely DISGUSTING! First thing I noticed when I walked into the hotel was the sanitation rating on the wall behind the front desk. Although it was a 93 I still wondered where they lost the other 7 points. While walking down to our room, I noticed a dead cockroach in the middle of the hall. I was pretty disgusted when I saw it and tried to stand as far away as possible every time I walked past it. When I got to my room, I decided to shower and noticed other people's hair on the towels and in the tub which made me wonder ""do they ever clean the tub or wash the towels?"" After my shower I was sitting on my bed brushing my hair when I noticed a small blackish brown bug crawling across. I freaked out and my mom came over to kill it. While she was getting a tissue I spotted another one... and then another one. At that point my step dad decided to check their bed too and found them crawling in their bed as well. We were so disgusted we grabbed all of our stuff and ran to the front desk. We told the guy there were bugs in the bed and he gave us a new room on the second floor. Although the new beds seem to be fine, I can assure everyone reading this that I will NOT be staying here ever again. I will pay DOUBLE to stay in a different hotel if I have to!",negative
"So where do I begin...the entire experience at this hotel was a complete nightmare. My friend and I were going on a mission trip to Guatemala and stayed here the night before flying out of Charlotte. We checked in later in the evening, we were told when we booked the room that parking was included with the price of our stay but upon checking in that was not true and we were asked to pay extra for parking. It was late and we were tired so we just paid extra for parking. The employee that checked us in asked where my car was parked and I told him, he then said you need to move your car to the far side of the parking lot into a specific parking spot so I did, he also said yes when I asked if my car would be safe and watched by video. After moving the car we went to our room to get settled, we had a non smoking room that had obviously been chain smoked in, the room was not very clean but we were tired and decided just to make do with what we had been given...huge mistake! We woke up early and checked out, walking to my car I realized that the entire back side glass had been beat out of my suv and all our luggage had been taken! I ran inside and told the employee working the front desk what I had seen, he had no remorse and stated I would need to call the police that he would not call them for me! Keep in mind we were scheduled to fly out in 3 hours and had to get to the airport immediately. The hotel didn't once say I'm sorry this happened or how can I help. There was no manager on duty and I when I asked to speak to one, he finally got her on the phone and she stated I would need to call the police and the hotel was not responsible for this incident. Absolutely no remorse, no apologies, nothing! I then asked the hotel employee to review the video of my car and see if anything was on camera, turns out there were no cameras on that part of the parking lot, keep in mind that this is the same employee that told me which spot to park in and assured me that my car was being watched by video. I'm pretty sure I was set up to be robbed. Needless to say I drove my car to the airport to avoid missing my flight. After returning a week later I called the hotel to speak with the manager on 4 separate occasions, I was told that the manager was not there and that they didn't know when she would be in or when she would return my call. Again no apologies & no remorse! This happened this 1st week of May 2016 today is July 30th 2016 and the manager Nita Shah has never returned any of my calls. I'm very disappointed and can not believe that a business would treat their customers this way. I very strongly suggest that you think twice before staying at the baymont on Scott Futrell Drive but if you like being lied to, robbed and mistreated this is the place for you! This place isn't worthy of one star but unfortunately I have to give at least one to make a review.",negative
"Nasty would be an understatement. Dead Roach when we walked in the room. American Airline placed us with this hotel. I would never book a 1 star hotel. Needless to say slept 2 hours, in clothes with towels on top of the bed. Couldn't leave quick enough. First shuttle to airport we got on would much rather sleep in a airport chair.",negative
Sadly I did not know any of these reviews before getting my so called discounted rate. I thought AA would set me up with something a little nicer; and please note I payed the same as I would have if I went online. There was no real discount. If I knew this or any other review I would have gladly payed and took my business elsewhere. Room is pretty dirty and since reading other reviews I'm sleeping clothed on top of the bed. I will not make this mistake again. I have stayed in better hostels overseas then this place. Staff was friendly but I will never stay at this hotel chan again and will gladly pay another $40 elsewhere so I can at least live comfortably and not worry about bed bugs or cockroaches. I wish I could be refunded and I would gladly go somewhere worth while even if I'm only in my hotel room for 6-7 hrs,negative
"My flight had mechanical problems so the airline gave me a voucher to stay here. It was pretty miserable overall. First the airline told me to call a number to get a shuttle, and no one answered. Finally got through to someone who said 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes later, I found a group of others who had just called and been told the same thing. Finally a shuttle shows up, and it's a minivan. Not everyone fits, so the guy says I'll be right back, and gets back 20 minutes later (side note: the ONLY saving grace at all is actually this shuttle driver. He takes us to the McDonald's drive-thru on the way because we're all starving and EVERYTHING in Charlotte is closed.) No issues checking in, but the hallways smell like, I don't know, a dingy apartment building, maybe? Not how a hotel is supposed to smell. Then I get to the room and the light switch right inside the door doesn't work. So I have to leave the door wide open to see and run across the room to turn on the light near the bed, which is creepy, because I'm alone and there seem to be a lot of older men million around even at 1am. The time on the alarm clock is wrong - thank god I checked. The wiring of the room is just terrible and there's a power strip hanging mid-air under the desk. There's flecks of paint all over the bathroom floor (one more ok thing: the water pressure in the shower was decent and the soap smelled great). I sleep for a couple hours and get downstairs at 7:35, just missed the 7:30 shuttle, and she says, there's not another one for an hour. I'm like what, my flight is at 9:25! She says she'll call the guy to come get me early. In the meantime, I check out the continental breakfast. There's what smells like bad milk in the mini fridge, only styrofoam cups for the juice in addition to the coffee (that sounds nit-picky, I know, but it's bad for the environment and unnecessary if the beverage isn't hot), and there still seem to be more than the average number of creepy middle-aged-to-older men. I think maybe they are long-term guests or something. Anyway, the shuttle guy (different driver than last night) shows up to get me ""early"" at 8:18am. Luckily I make my flight so we're all good. I'd definitely not go back there, especially not alone. I don't think the airline should send people there either.",negative
"This is about as gross as you can get.... it smells horrible and utterly flithy. AVOID THIS HOTEL! But seriously, it smells disgusting and it's nauseating. Another tragic feature or lack of feature is that there are no curtains to close when you want to sleep or undress. The entire parking lot can see into your room. Sadly, there was a street light right outside of my window that was shining in my room and it was really hard to sleep (see pic).",negative
Do not stay here. All the bad reviews are true. Do not stay here. Sleep in a rental car. Sleep at the airport. Do not stay here. Stains EVERYWHERE. The smell was god-awful. Do not stay here. Nothing works. The AC wouldn't stay on. Do not stay here. The refrigerator sounded like a freight train and had to be unplugged. Do not stay here. Furniture? Hairdryer? Coffee machine? Toilet seat? Broken. The good news... sign in the lobby said that they no longer accept cash and only accept payment with credit cards now. I guess the strip joint next door wasn't turning out clientele that was aligned to their brand.,negative
"The worst hotel i have stayed in period. I made the mistake of thinking that USAirways/AA would have put their customers in a decent place due to a flight issue that was caused by a personal issue. After waiting over 45 mins for shuttle, there wasn't enough room so i grabbed a cab. Thankfully beat the full shuttle there, I was almost checked in before they got there. I was told to be down at 415 to leave for airport next morning. Hotel room was plain, old, gross and has definitely seen much better days about 30 years ago. Had an issue getting on shuttle in the morning, was told that because i didnt sign some clipboard that was to determine who and what seats were available for each shuttle. However the woman who checked me in was the one that took care of it for me...how the heck would i know to be downstairs at 415a? Just a mess all around, thankfully backseat riders squeezed over so all could fit. If you absolutely have to stay here, know you have been warned. I personally will never do it again, I will stay at another hotel on my dime. Oh and don't say my room number out loud in front of others...talk about a security risk and think about the safety of your hotel guests!!",negative
"I am commenting regarding this hotel's denial to provide a room to a US military serviceman. WTF are you people thinking? To deny service for a person who may, god forbid, put his LIFE in peril for our country! The sacrifices that this young person has made to ensure that our way of life continues, and yet to turn him out into the streets? The apology emails were, although seemingly sincere, are too late. Your establishment had committed a foul and I hope others will spread the word of your company's position regarding service members. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! .......Sgt. USMC",negative
"Worst hotel ever!!! Completely disgusting and the staff was rude!!! The hotel reeked of cigarettes and our room looked like a homeless person was living in it. Also, It appeared that there were ""transactions"" being made in the lobby. I would rather sleep on the floor of the airport then ever return to this repulsive hotel.",negative
"US Air bungled my connection at Charlotte international airport and put me up at this motel for the night. + only 1.8 miles away from airport + front desk checked me in under two minutes - I found the alarm clock unplugged, the phone doesn't work at all and the TV remote control can mute but it doesn't change channels - The shuttle only goes to the airport once an hour - the parking lot is partially flooded when it rains. There appears to be drainage issues - The hotel decor is outdated by 25 or 30 years and looks very rundown, dirty - hallway lighting is insufficient - The electricity outlets are so beat up that my chargers for my phone and Mac won't even stay in them so I can't even get any work done - $59/night (paid by US air) seems expensive for the quality of this property. On a side note, U.S. Air should be embarrassed for putting passengers in this motel to suffer.",negative
The worst experience I have ever had was staying here. After missing a connecting flight on US Airway due to an engine problem they had offered us to stay at this place. All the reviews here are so true. If only I had read the reviews before I would have preferred to stay in the airport floor or book a hotel and pay for it instead. The carbon monoxide alarm went off and the flash strobe light went off for the rest of the night. There was no phone to even call the front desk and tell them of the incident. We were so tired but didn't sleep all night. In the morning we told the person at the front desk and he didn't even seem to care..just asked what room number we were in.. Didn't say sorry or anything. If I could leave a -5 rating I would.,negative
"Stranded in Charlotte by an airline and gifted a ""discount"" voucher only to be reminded how much it pays to read reviews! The first room I was placed in was a previous smoking room that has been converted, unsuccessfully and the bed was missing a mattress pad, half the lights weren't working and I could hear every thing the people in the next room were doing. The front desk granted me with a new room which was delightful-at first...until the night club fired up the bass. Seriously, it's 3:01 and the bass is vibrating my bed! I need to be up in 3 hours and can't believe I paid for this! Bad made worse!",negative
"The best part about this hotel is that I get to rate it one star, which helps even out my Yelp profile as I had way too many four and five star reviews and was starting to look like a nice person. This is the worst hotel I've seen in the past fifteen years... And that counts inner city gems in New Delhi, Kabul and Cusco. US Airways (another one star review) made me miss my connection by exactly two minutes (I was running up as they were closing the door) and then informed me I couldn't stay in the airport and gave me a number to call to get a discounted room. Two hours on hold and seventy dollars later, I take the shuttle to the Baymont and experience the horrors. After receiving several of those looks that make my 'woman traveling alone' spidey senses fire off, I rode the Guantanamo Bay hotbox of an elevator up to the second floor, musing how the hallway carpet had the same tack to it as a theater floor after several matinee showings of a children's movie. Things got better as I opened my door and was greeting by a wall of endocrine system altering air 'freshener.' The carpet here appeared to have the consistency of the AstroTurf lining a South Jersey motel pool and black marks and dents covered the walls. Turning to shut the door, I issued a bitter laugh after noting the door chain and no receiver to slide it in to. Rather than deal with a room reassignment, I wedged a chair under the door handle and removed the stained comforter with the alacrity of a stage performer pulling a tablecloth from under Steuben crystal. Inspecting the sheets, I elected to sleep on top of the fitted sheet and under the large scarf I travel with for such instances. The ultimate affront occurred after I plugged my phone charger into the wall and turned to set the phone down on the night stand, pausing in a stomach churning frozen stance after seeing the wasteland that was not one, but both bedside tables. What appeared to be greasy, sticky, smeared handprints covered both... as well as the headboard. I winced, put the phone on the bed next to me and stretched out crosswise, trying to split the difference between the foot of the bed and the headboard of horrors. The night continued. At approximately 3:30 AM, someone slid a key into my door lock, and opened the door as far as it would go against my chair barrier. ""Who are you and what are you doing?!"" I yelled (with more expletives) as I sprung to the floor, contemplating using a lamp as a shillelagh. ""Oh... Sorry... My bad..."" The interloper left, neglecting, of course, to shut the door fully. At 5 AM, my phone rang. ""Hello?"" I asked, groggily. ""Who is this?"" Came a thickly accented voice from the other side. ""No, who am I talking to? You tell me first."" ""This is the front desk. I must know who is in this room."" ""I filled out your information sheet at check in, you can look at that and find out."" I hung up. Breakfast featured powdered dairy creamer and stale corn flakes and fruit loops. Despite the subsidization of this hotel by the airport and US Airways, I still believe in the power of the free market and feverishly hope against hope that this place will implode back into the gaping maw from whence it emerged. Until then, don't stay there, folks!",negative
"I really don't understand why people would expect some grandiose experience from a place like this. No false advertising on their part! The place is gross. No doubt. I'm talking stains: Chocolate syrup? Blood? Food? Definitely. Mystery stains? Definitely. You'll find some burn holes on your ""non-smoking room"" blankets, not that you'll be touching those anyway. Seriously, don't. I slept on top of everything in full garb. Still didn't feel safe. Don't touch the floor either. Nonetheless, you totally get what you pay for at this place. As for the guy at the front office, he had a very pleasant disposition. He boasted at length about the shuttle service they offered, which is completely free. Derrick, the gentleman who does a kick ass job with the shuttle, is rarely informed about people who have scheduled a ride through the hotel, until roughly 30 minutes to an hour before. (He runs at every quarter past the hour.) Mind you, he totally bucks up and does it, but come on amicable dude at the hotel, give this poor guy more than a 9 minute (!!!) heads up at 5am. So, to conclude my lengthy ramble, hotel is repulsive. Shuttle is fantastic. Tip that guy.",negative
"Called ahead off the North Carolina Travel coupons 1-4 people $55 night . Manager on midnight duty on the night of 3/10/14 said come in and we will work it out when we questioned the type of beds . Once there he was incompetent enough to say he had to call his manager to verify the price in the add I had handed him . I was floored when he said it was for a single room and if we wanted 2 beds it would be $79 . When I questioned the add and the common sense when it stated 1-4 people, he unbelievably said it was one bed and I said it didn't make sense 1 bed 4 people . "" you can fit 4 people in a king bed "" is what he said. At first wasn't sure if he was serious or joking . Very unprofessional and it was obvious it was a shake down . As I waited I notice how dirty and run down the lobby looked . It looked more like a hooker/ drug motel . As I walked out upset I realize how a blessing it was not to stay in that place with my kids . They need to have a no star option .... Stay away don't waste your breath or time with this place.",negative
If I could give it ZERO stars I would. DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION. Rooms are filthy and the managers make you feel slightly uncomfortable. We saw the room and left. Kind of the scene for a thriller movie.,negative
I booked this hotel on price line it was rated a 2 star I don't know how? The pictures looked good so I gave it a shot what a nightmare! I booked a nonsmoking king size bed and. And when I got there they said they didn't have any. So it was late I missed my flight I was tired I noticed the security monitor on the front desk with and cameras ever where. It made me feel it was unsafe. The Indian guy at the counter was nice. So I took the elevator that was very old and missing buttons to the second floor and the second floor was scary no lights only a couple very dim. They had old furniture from other rooms in the hallway! So I finally get to my room and same thing only 2 small lights very dim the ceiling was chipping away carpet has tons of stains and the pillows were a joke. I couldn't sleep because the bugs in the bed were itching me. I checked in at midnight checked out at 6 am went to the airport hours early. I don't get why the Indian hotel owners are so cheap and dirty. The room cost me $70.00 was not worth $20 this place should be a motel. I will never ever stay at a bay mont inn again. Oh I almost forgot the shower smelled like bo (body odor),negative
"Was put here after I missed my connection. Clearly, as my mom always reminds me, you get what you pay for. After sitting at the airport last night for about half an hour waiting for the shuttle, now told that the shuttle will be 10 minutes late this morning. That was 20 minutes ago. Not a surprise given other comments on this place. Unpleasant stale odor? Check. Seedy feel? Check. Owner clearly milking this place for every dime. The only partially redeeming quality? Front desk associate was friendly and courteous. Thankfully, I don't plan on missing a lot of flights at CLT...",negative
"I was placed at this property because of a missed flight connection and had to stay in Charlotte overnight. I had stayed at this property two years previously due to a similar flight issue and was pleased to be sent to this location again - until I arrived! The property has clearly undergone a change in management since my last ""visit."" The quality of the property has seriously deteriorated. The property is warn and unclean. After checking in, I requested a wake-up call and was told that the telephone and email service of the property were down ""because of the flood."" It was suggested I use the alarm clock in the room - which turned out to be broken. The next morning when I asked what time the shuttle to the airport would be leaving, I was told that it would be delayed because ""You know how the airport traffic is!"" How am I supposed to know Charlotte airport traffic when I live in Los Angeles?!",negative
"We waited for an hour for the shuttle and ended up taking a cab because it never showed up, even when we called the front desk and she said it was ""on it's way."" The hotel is run down and has a funny smell. Room was not very clean, bed was made with new sheets but it was tough falling asleep on 30 thread count sheet. Would not recommend it.",negative
"This hotel is gross. There is a sign in the lobby that states they have a 94 sanitation rating, but my husband and I would never have believed that. The hotel looked run down, unkempt, dirty, and like the kind of place that could be reserved by the hour. We were on the first floor and had to walk by the laundry room to get to our room. The door to the laundry room was always open and unpleasant smells were wafting all over. There were multiple stains in the carpet and the door across the hall from us looked like it had been kicked in - there were paint shards all over the floor from where it had obviously been kicked off the door. The lobby was very unkempt, with chunks of wall and ceiling missing and an overall dirty feeling. It also took a ridiculously long time to check in and out. The room felt dirty, there were cigarette burns in the nightstands of our nonsmoking room, there was no comforter on the bed, and I was afraid of what I'd find on the sheets if I looked closely. There was no remote when we got there and after requesting one, it still didn't work. We had to have a maintenance guy come to our room. The bathroom looked clean enough, but we didn't spend a lot of time in there. Husband went to find an ice machine, the sole of which is located on the 3rd floor, and was so sketched out by the elevator that he took the stairs down, which were no better. He said he felt as though he'd turn come down a flight and find someone peeing in the corner. There were lots of loud noises while we were there: banging, yelling, door slamming, etc. We were planning to partake in the free continental breakfast, but after experiencing the overall ""ickiness"" of the hotel, we decided to pass. As we were checking out, another guest came to the front desk to inform the staff that the orange juice was coming out as water. We ate breakfast at Mattie's Diner instead and it it was delicious. I will never stay at a Baymont hotel again.",negative
"This place literally does have the best prices in town. I found myself in a grind and needed a rental car for a month and needed one quick. All the major rental companies cost over a thousand and some were almost two thousand. Steffan and Jack got me in a car that day for half the price of anyone else. I've had zero issues throughout the month. Nice brand new cars too, great variety. I highly recommend Best Way to anyone looking for a rental car.",positive
I was in las vegas for a business trip and had gto rent a car so i got a 2016 passat. Very clean nice car and a great company for car rentals... easy friendly and good quality! Im a very satified costumer and thank god they have new owners :),positive
"Attn to those two awful reviews before,It's under new ownership now! Katie was so helpful showing me everything I needed to know about these beautiful rentals. They are affordable and so close to the airport (and the cars are like brand new). I wouldn't go anywhere else to rent a car while in town ever again! Thank you Steffan and Katie for being so kinda and helpful and turning this place around!",positive
"i agree with the review from cody. beware of this establishment. tom donly is the manager. he is a liar and a thief. he purchased an ad from me, then disputed it and said he did not advertise, it was not him. i have the recordings it was his rude, blunt, lying voice. do not trust him or this establishment!!!!",negative
"Don't go, but if you do, don't talk to John or Tom! I recall the manager's name being John, but when I asked again he said it was Tom... I have had multiple touch points with this gentlemen who was rude and abrupt over the phone and in person. I'll never forget these words ""I rented you a car... You didn't sell me your life!"" Those words came from the Best Way Auto Car & Truck Rental establishment which apparently doesn't care about customer best interest. This was a response after I inquired as to why I received a dirty vehicle with a half empty tank of gas only after being told that my reservation was lost and the vehicle I placed to rent was not available. The salesman lied throughout the conversation regarding my reservation and provided terrible customer service. My advice is... Go elsewhere and avoid the lies and poor attitude and service.",negative
"The best kept secret in Vegas. No resort fees, onsite (and easy) parking, wonderful staff, clean rooms. The only thing you miss out on is a view. Who goes to Vegas to stay in their room though, right? I loved that we walked out of the hotel and just a few steps through the Casino and boom bada bang we were on The Strip baby! I would stay here over and over due to the ease of getting out and not having to walk through 400,000 square feet of casino to get to the strip. Thanks for the wonderful stay and we can't wait to visit again!",positive
"I highly recommend this hotel if you're planning a trip to Las Vegas! I am a huge fan of the BW franchise and this one didn't fail! It's located right now to Walgreens on the strip and the front desk is kinda hard to find at first. We found security in the parking lot who led us to the front desk and he also gave us water bottles! So the casino is on the first floor. The front desk is towards the right side. There's a little souvenir shop more to the right. I remember seeing a Ben and Jerry's there too. Left side is Walgreens and White Castle! Super convenient if you need buy something you didn't bring because Walgreens sells everything (overpriced though). I stopped by both Walgreens White Castle a bunch of times during my stay at BW. OMG so cool just walk out and back in, no need to drive. Anyways, the hotel was nice. The staff was nice. The room was nice. And the price was nice! There's no ""resort"" fee or parking fee either. You will get a piece of paper that is your parking pass for the lot. We were always able to find parking whether it was on the ground floor or in the parking garage. The room was nice. There was only one day we didn't get our room serviced but it was because we slept in late and didn't go out until later. I was hoping our room would still get serviced while we were gone because many hotels I've been to did that for us on their own. It's okay though because I called the front desk for fresh sets of towel and they got here in a jiffy! Very happy with that! The stay itself was dirt cheap! How much I paid for the week was cheaper than staying in one night elsewhere! I was hoping this BW had free continental breakfast like many BW I been to but they didn't. It's okay though because Vegas the city itself had so much food to offer! Overall I LOVED this place for my stay in Vegas. It was the perfect location. On the strip. Free parking. Next to Walgreens and White Castle. Close to everything! Just be careful when you turn into the alley to go into the lot because it's a super busy street and people are crossing 24/7. Anyways love love love this place!",positive
The check-in will take you 20 to 30 minute's and that's if no one is in front of you because it doubles as the players club. The room was clean but we were woke each morning to the sound of alarms on the delivery trucks at Harrah's. If you want heat in your room this is not the motel for you. The heat does not work and when you ask to have it fixed they tell you its old and does not work and there is nothing they can do. So if your cold go to the casino bar where I kid you not they run the heat so hot that it has you sweating. In the casino they have a less then desirable clientele that made my wife feel unsafe. The parking garage if you find it is disgustingly dirty with very small parking spots.,negative
"Great place to stay. Clean comfortable rooms -fridge included. Right on the strip! My wife, two kids and I stayed there for three nights and really enjoyed it. Great room keeping and customer service!",positive
"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights from Thursday to Sunday in a standard king bed room on the 4th floor. Me and my husband are college students so the hotel was good enough for us. The fridge was cold, clean room, very comfy bed, and a good size. The only true negative thing was the temperature with the shower was finicky. The water would be a nice warm temperature then would suddenly switch to burning hot or cold randomly. The hotdogs and drinks were pretty good for the price and were good in the casino. The casino has a hometown feel and isn't that smokey as the other people say. If you are a prissy person then don't come here. It had good payouts and alot of slot machines. This casino is for the average middle class folk. Don't get the Noble Roman Pizza at the casino. The pizza is low quality frozen type and cardboard.",positive
"I sure do love their cheap gaming tables, a true oasis in the middle of The Strip. Their tables are fun and they comp white castles (really) but two things make me not want to go there regularly. The amount of smoke due to the short ceilings and the down right rude dealer that they have kept me from visiting when my friends wanted to go last time. This should be a 2.5 star, because I can't agree with the ""A-OK!"" rating, but also hope they improve b/c I could love this place.",negative
"Decided to play here after trying White Castle. My gf wanted to sign up for the players card but couldn't find the rewards center. She asked a worker who flagged down another I think his name was Jeff. Older gentleman. He took our Id's and input the info into his handheld device. Left for a few seconds then returned with new players cards for us. Explained the promotion they had going. Fast and friendly service. While playing we were asked how we were if we needed anything. No luck this time but we will be back, it's nice to play in a casino where you feel appreciated.",positive
"Never stayed in the hotel, but it's the funnest hole in the wall casino on the strip! We make it a point to go there every visit!",positive
"Pretty cool place! We walked down here from Aria to gamble a little bit and snag some cheap cocktails. We signed up for their rewards card, and they had a promotion where they reimburse you for the first $20 you lose on the slots. The chick who signed us up was really weird and ran through how to use the promotion like an auctioneer, all in one breath while staring down awkwardly at the card and avoiding eye contact. We went on our way and luckily were able to figure out how to use the promotion. They have $1 Michelobs, and well mixed drinks for like two or three dollars as well. The vodka cran I had was really tasty, and had a fair amount of alcohol for the price point. The slots here were a little looser than on the rest of the strip, which was nice. And the promotion ran as offered, although I'm an idiot and didn't realize that you have to use your replacement $20 all on one machine or else you lose it. Overall, not a bad experience at all, we really enjoyed ourselves. We'll be back on our next trip to get a break from the glitz and glamour of the rest of the strip!",positive
"Each time my husband and I go to Vegas, we have to spend at least 1 evening at the Casino Royale. The staff is so cool and the place is clean, fun and has lots to offer. One evening we played for 3 hours on the penny slots using the $20 we started with. I can't say enough good things about this place.",positive
"Can't comment on the actual rooms, as I did not stay here. However, the roulette table served me well. I enjoyed the cheaper-than-other-casino minimums and cheap drinks. Also, the service of the drinks for those playing games was very prompt. Definitely not a high-class, upscale spot, but it works if money is running low.",positive
Went to their bar only! The martinis (any mix) are worth $1.50!! Be generous on tips! ;) Bartenders are quite cool and friendly. The casino by itself is nice and quite big (I got lost somehow :/ )!,positive
I used to really like this casino. The dealers were cool and they had a number of table games that you could choose from. Plus they have outback which is one of my favorite restaraunts. Now I don't gamble here anymore because they got rid of all my favorite table games and they went down to 2 craps tables. And it's ALWAYS full. Just come here for outback and that's it. Disappointed!,negative
"My boyfriend and I love this hidden gem! I remember when I first came to Vegas, I was just about to check in until I said ""Um, babe, is there a ""Vegas"" check in? You know, just generic? I really don't want to check into a Best Western."" After he had a good laugh as I continued to search for a Las Vegas check in, I realized I mine as well swallow my pride and admit I'm in Vegas staying at a Best Western. We go up to our room and after opening the door I was pleasantly surprised! The room was immaculate, nicely designed, had a Keurig, a fridge, FREE WIFI, and large bathroom. All for $53 a night. On a weekend. Whaaaat?! Yeah, that's right. Pound pound to the big man at Best Western in Vegas. No need to stay in expensive hotels in the surrounding area; you'll be spending most of your money anyway on drinks, cabs, and clubs. And you probably will just be using your hotel room to sleep or maybe some other stuff if you feel like doing the whole ""what stays in Vegas"". So save yourself money and stay here. Or don't. It let's us have more rooms available if you decide to go somewhere else.",positive
"Probably the nicest best western I've been in. Kind of a crowded feeling casino floor, but whatever. The table gambling was cheap, the drinks were extremely cost-effective, and the environment seemed lively. Would likely return.",positive
Do not go here! Its a dive and its dangerous too.There are fights and someone got stabbed in there while we were in town.All that cheap booze and no security makes it a scary place to hang out.I would rather go to the better casinos with lots of security myself and enjoy myself and be safe at the same time.,negative
"Don't step foot in here if you are snotty or expecting a Wynn type casino. I have never stayed here so I can't review that piece of it but this is one of the stops we make every time I come to Vegas. Dark, smokey, and sketchy - definitely.... but I love some of their older slot machines and I seem to do quite well on their penny machines compared to other casinos. The free slot play and other offers they have are all bogus... they are just to get people in the door. And I have to wonder with all the pictures up of big $ winners how long they have been collecting those photos to show? The food choices here are definitely a plus if you are doing Vegas on the cheap. The other great part about this location is the 1/2 price ticket place located inside their casino - this place is not a scam and you can save a ton of $ on show tickets and dinner!",negative
"I like this casino, even though its small and the floor drinks are bad lol. I like the $1 beer and the fact that it feels like old school Vegas. Stayed here once, wouldn't stay here again, but the slots pay out ok.",negative
"A grungy place but worth it if you like the $1 margarita and beer options. You can get either a strawberry or lime margarita which is unique because for cheap margaritas on the LV strip, the typical option is only a lime margarita. The drinks itself werent super strong but were pretty tasty. It is cash only so you can't keep an open bar tab. The Casino itself is pretty smokey and is not really for a young crowd. Its definitely a contrast when compared to the Venetian and although it was grungy, it was a breath of fresh air from the hoity toity feel of the other large casinos. If you're low on cash and want cheap drinks, then this is a good option. Most casinos feature the $1 option as a special but it's standard at Casino Royale. Also, they do have an option to buy cheap huge hog dogs and munchies so if youre into cheap food, and drinks, then head here. We personally didn't stay here so I don't know if the accomodations reflect the general seedy feel of the casino..",positive
"I wandered in only to use their ATM ... 2 hrs later I was still at the roulette table. Casino Royale is a must on any trip I ever make to Vegas. Sure it's a small, smokey, seedy casino and the $50 free slot play promotion is laughable at best but I love it! The dealers are super friendly and patient especially if you're a newbie that's just learning how to play table games. Unlike the more popular upscale casinos the cocktail waitress come around often *especially if you tip them. The table limits are $3-$5 and with a little luck/strategy you can most certainly win here. I did... several times. (: *This shouldn't have to be said but PLEASE tip your dealers & waitresses, most of their pay comes from your tips. If you're down you can't tip what you don't have but I've seen people win hundreds of dollars off one hit and tip the dealer $1 if at all, disgusting.",positive
"We didn't stay here but had fun gambling her. The dealers were a mix of fun and serious. We switched tables a few times. Our favorite was playing $5 minimum black jack switch (really a $10 minimum because you have to play two hands at once). Our favorite slot was wheel of fortune. It's a small casino, a little old Vegas style but on the strip.",positive
"The bf and I stumbled upon this place as we were walking down the strip. The lured us in with ""Free $50 slot play"". This was such a horrible joke. You have to spend all the money until you hit a large jackpot. Lame. Waste of 10 minutes. However, we did love their tables. They have single deck blackjack which was awesome. You can earn points with the players card which can get you food at their food court or upstairs at Outback. $1 margaritas!",positive
"Casino review only. I liked this place, probably because it was the only casino where I won money. Dealers were friendly. They have $5 tables, which is nice. There is a subway and a hotdog stand in the back, this place is definitely tacky, but dealers are nicer than higher priced casinos and they have $5 tables!",positive
"I almost want to give this place 1 star just so the craps tables won't be so packed when I go back, but I won't. It's simple. If you're a pimp, you play craps. If you ain't 'cause you not then you play one of those other sorry ass grandpa table games, but this is why I'm hot. I'm not going to write about those other noob games because my sack isn't hanging down to my knees yet AKA I'm still young and ballin' like Spaldin'. If you do play those other sorry ass grandpa table games then get yo' ass to the MGM where all of the other old people go to die. I play craps because my boner is strong. Casino Royale has awesome craps because it has low minimums and high odds. If you are not loaded with mommy and daddy money then this is most def ideal place to play some craps if you want to make some money, talk shit to people playing on the dark side (don't pass line), and getting fucked up on White Russians, Jack and Cokes, and brews. I swear, 90% of the time this baller throws the dice (noob.yelp.com), he hooks everyone and their moms up with cash money. God, I love myself. KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBE! Get $$$! P.S. if you're looking to find slam pieces then def don't come here. Your boner will die within 2 minutes of walking through the front door. P.P.S. watch yourself on your White Russian consumption. I almost deuced myself after the 4th one last time and had to switch to whiskey. It might've been the milk they were using or maybe it had to do with me making so much God damn money. OH NO YOU DI'INT!... ...why yes, I did!",positive
I needed some real VEGAS time.....some gambling and nothing else. They have the most $5 tables on the strip so someone suggested we go there and check it out. The craps table is usually pretty packed and for good reason. I made a lot of money in this place (that i subsequently lost elsewhere). So much money that the first night when I stumbled in there I had to ask the guy the name of the place just to be sure I remembered it correctly. Or it could have been because I was a bit inebriated and still ended up doing well on the craps table. I like vegas. They had some super cheap drinks too. $1 beers and $3 u call its.... awesome place to gamble,positive
"Food Court review only: That was one nasty hot dog... their food court advertises $1.99 hot dogs. I expected maybe Costco quality hot dogs (considering you can get a pretty decent polish sausage and soda for $1.50), if not better. I was a little sketched out by the price, but figured since it is Vegas, cheap deals are plentiful. I should really listen to that little voice of reason every once and a while... What I got was a really shitty bun (super dry and old). The hot dog itself was ok, but more lukewarm if anything. Even with dousing it in ketchup, I could tell the bun was super dry. This may be harsh and all, but note that I was f-ed up out of my mind at this point. Gambling was sort of a blur (though in the end, I think I came up about even). I was hungry and saw the sign. Normally any food if it's even remotely good (and greasy) tastes amazing at this point of inebriation. Unfortunately, this hot dog didn't. Next time, if I make it here, it's drinking and gambling for me only. I'll eat beforehand.",negative
"Reasons to come to this casino - switch blackjack. Don't like the two hands you got dealt? Switch the top cards between the two deals for better hands. And at 5 bucks a hand (off peak) and 10 at peak, you are still coming under the table averages at nearby casinos - 1.50 bottles of Miller Lite. Sure, beer is free if you are playing - but if you are walking and taking in the sights, even a well-level beer like ML or MGD will run you 6 bucks at other bars. Sad, true. Just don't ask for a bottle at the tables - they only brink you 6 oz drafts, but they will bring you one every two minutes, so don't worry - every table here has the stylin' vibe of the casino room in the later scenes in the Bond flick of the same name. OK, not even close actually. Cheap tables, cheap drinks - cheap people. Threads here are more 'Earnhardt' and 'Sturgis' than Armani - but they don't take themselves very seriously, so you are bound to get a fun table or a less stuffy dealer. - attached Denny's. Not to say that I have even eaten at this location, but the idea of a Grand Slam in the middle of the night of drinking does have its appeal. And for all the 24/7 attitude Vegas has, try finding something other than a sit down cafe in a hotel open after 1 am on the strip - not many options, strangely - likely because at that hour they want your ass at the tables rather than sobering up over a Moons Over My-hammy.",negative
"$1 ATM fee- cheapest I could find on the strip. This is pretty much the only reason I kept going back here. Wedged right next to the Venetian and Palazzo, and across the street from nearby Caesar's Palace, Treasure Island and the Mirage, this is by far one of the cheapest casinos on the center strip. I thought the $1 Roulette tables were enticing, but there is only 1 wheel for 2 tables so it took foreverrrrr. It's an OK place to stop by if you still want to gamble but don't have enough money left to play the higher stakes table games at the casinos right next door. But if you're really in need for cheaper gambling, I'd rather go downtown to Fremont-- more selection of cheap games and casinos, and also some of the cheapest buffets :)",negative
"I don't understand why anyone plays Blackjack here & yet in some respects I do. I ask myself, ""Why would anyone play somewhere where the house always has an absolutely unbeatable advantage over you, versus next door where you at least have a shot at winning? UH... ISN'T IT CHEAP TO PLAY BLACKJACK AT CASINO ROYALE? Well, let's review the blackjack tables at Casino Royale, shall we? --- Deceptively low edge (.20%) 8-deck H17 $5/$500 with a CSM on every one of the 6 tables & 'Switch' rules. --- The dread 6:5 (1.24%) single-deck H17 $5/$1000 across 2 tables with a special rule giving 2:1 on diamond blackjacks. Now, if either of these games look at all attractive to you... uh... well, dear reader, read on. ""THE DUMBING DOWN OF AMERICA"" I'm sorry but I really am not concerned about how the casino is located on the strip or how cheap the beers are: The reason they can afford to be on the strip with cheap beer is because these are really BAD tables for blackjack players. In fact, I believe these tables at the Casino Royale are downright disrespectful to players and it just makes me mad because the fact that people STILL PLAY THEM seems to exemplify the dumbing down of America. I heard one guy at CR say, ""I just wanna have fun... it's easy to play here and the limits are low."" Astounding. That's just like those people that go, ""I'm playing for comps... I just want to break even during my trip."" Attention Vegas gamers: Y'all do realize that this is precisely what the casinos want you thinking? Does this phrase sound familiar?: ""You're probably not going to win, so why complicate things with 'rules' & 'odds'? You're here to have fun... so what if you lose a little? You're having a good time, right? And hey - that's all that matters!"" How many times have you heard that line? By any chance, did it come from a casino employee? In case you hadn't heard, this is called the ""Sucker's Credo"" and while you're telling yourself this over and over, there are OTHER individuals that don't subscribe to this sort of thinking and thus, more often than not, leave Vegas net-positive (i.e. WINNERS) having had their casino winnings pay for their meals, shows, cabs, tips, room service, Forum Shops charges, flights, and still have something left to pad their wallets with. Meanwhile, Casino Royale players ""lose slowly""... and losing slowly is still LOSING which is bad... ...but losing voluntarily is straight up DUMB. PLEASE... DON'T PLAY BLACKJACK AT CASINO ROYALE. Handing your money over to places like these only encourages them to run more bad games against, frankly, poorly-informed tourists. NONE of their blackjack tables are good games. Meanwhile there are good games that are playable just across the street! Here's a few casinos nearby that have much better blackjack table rules/configurations available to play than Casino Royale. - Wynn 2-deck 3:2 - Paris 6-deck 3:2 - Mirage 2-deck 3:2 CONCLUSION: Rule #1: Don't play at Casino Royale. Rule #2: Go pick up a Basic Strategy card. Put it on the table while you play & stick to it. Rule #3: Don't play at Casino Royale. Rule #4: Go find a game that has good rules. I've listed a few above near Casino Royale. Rule #5: Don't play at Casino Royale. Rule #6: If you can't afford the limits, save up or DON'T PLAY. Rule #7: Don't play at Casino Royale. Rule #8: All casinos with really crappy rules get... 1-Star. ------------------ EVEN MORE REASONS WHY CASINO ROYALE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR ACTION: 1) Unfriendly, sneering dealers who will occasionally deign to verbally abuse the patrons. 2) All the 'ghetto-ness' of downtown without the benefit of good casino rules & elegant show/dinner comps. 3) The constant unavoidable blare of the sidewalk audio recording should be enough for anyone to hate this place.",negative
"So it's not the most glamorous hotel, but it's damn cheap compared to some of its neighbors, and it's in a great location! You can walk to most of the major casinos including the Venetian, the Mirage, Caesar's Palace, etc (depending on how far you're willing to walk).",negative
"Four nights around the 4th of July holiday period. Reasonable price, quiet, clean, courteous and friendly staff, good location. Room was standard - two double beds, flat screen tv on the wall, bureau with drawers, easy chair and a desk with task chair. Bureau has a mini fridge, and there is a single cup coffee machine/ice bucket/ceramic mugs on the table. Lighting is okay - make sure you get a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor so you can open the drapes to get more sunlight, as those on the first floor, drapes open and people walking by on the sidewalk or driveway look right into your room. Bathroom is smaller than usual - open the door and you have to move around the toilet to close the door/etc. Breakfast included - meat (sausage or bacon), scrambled eggs, waffles, pastry/muffins, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juice, milk. Small room - no windows in basement with tables, chairs and a large flat screen tv on the wall. Attendant cleaned the tables, replenished the food - very pleasant, make sure you leave a gratuity for her. Parking lot kind of small, so there is an overflow lot next door, which is nice, because its connected to the business next door and allows you to exit turning left out of the hotel, which is near impossible at the regular entrance/exit as its at a busy 4-way intersection. Restaurant had a nice menu, apparently does room service, but we did not try. Only open till about 9 PM in the evenings. Nothing else really within walking distance. A nice hotel if you are visiting family in the area, not really close to the highway. Near President Garfield's home, a mall and plenty of stores, but no landmarks to speak of.",negative
"After traveling 4 1/2 hours to participate in an Australian Shepherd Instagram meet up, it was nice to be able to relax with our dog before the drive home the next day. Our room was in excellent condition, clean and comfortable. We also found some gorgeous areas to explore along the Lake Erie Shoreline the next day that were a very short distance from the hotel",positive
"This Hotel Gets an A+ For Friendliness This is not a fancy hotel (in fact it may be a little dated) however it is clean and every person we had contact with was super friendly. There is not much in the way of fancy hotels in the Mentor or Painesville area. My husband has family in the area so we visited a different hotel last time we visited which I reviewed and believe this hotel is a much better choice for the area, maybe even the best choice however I have not visited every hotel in the area. We drove up from North Carolina and had to use the restroom as soon as we arrived as there was not a rest area for at least the last hour of the drive so we needed to run in to ""take care of business"" first. The tall gentleman at the desk pointed us to the rest rooms in the lobby which was my first experience with the hotel. While the hotel is not fancy I could immediately see that someone took the time to make nice little ""homey"" touches. These nice ""homey"" touches"" are evident throughout the hotel. And it was very clean as well. Great first impression before check-in. Since we drove straight through, my husband wanted to take a walk after sitting for so long. So after the short and friendly check-in process was completed (by the same tall gentleman) my husband made inquiries about a walk. The man suggested a very short walk (I did not track it but it was probably a half mile) to the James A Garfield National Historic Site which was a very nice museum for the 20th president. I recommend visiting the museum if you visit the area. I learned a lot. After the walk, we ate in the onsite restaurant, Skye, which was very nice. I will probably write a separate review for that however I would like to say it was a very pleasant surprise. The same restaurant also provides room service which we did not need on this trip since it was just an overnight trip. The restaurant is also popular with locals and can get busy I understand. They also provided a nice continental breakfast in the morning which also included scrambled eggs and sausages. I happen to enjoy especially fancy breakfasts downtown in our hometown so it is difficult for me to rate a continental breakfast objectively. The room was clean and even had the luggage racks out and setup. Our room had a small refrigerator which I always consider a plus. Though it is located on a highway, our room which was even on the first floor was very quiet (I should add I wear ear plugs because I find hotel room units to sometimes be very loud). Negatives? Well it is not a fancy hotel so keeping that in mind, the only ""negatives"" would be some possibly outdated info I found in the binder at the desk in the room. For instance it said there was not a restaurant on site. But on top of the desk it provides info about the onsite restaurant. The management may want to take a look at the binders to make certain it is current. Bottom Line: The room rate was a great value for what we received.",positive
"I really like this place!! We've stayed at Best Westerns across the country because they're pet friendly (generally), and this one has a nice homey feel to it. When we walked into the lobby after driving 8+ hours with the kids and cats in our car, we were welcomed by a beautiful living-room-esque lobby full of light and holiday atmosphere. Lois at the desk was super nice and helped us find parking near our room for our uhaul trailer so we'd be close to the car. All in all, we've really enjoyed Best Western and this hotel is at the top of that list! Recommend:)",positive
Very nice and clean accomodations. Comfortable rooms with beautiful decor. Staff is super friendly. Pets allowed. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.,positive
"This hotel has some character, it's location is convenient for the area, the breakfast is good, and they are dog friendly. unfortunately they missed on what's the main purpose of a hotel: a good night sleep! The mattress was hard in parts, soft in others it felt ancient and not very clean. The pillows were lumpy and also not very clean. the pillow covers were yellowish in parts! You will think that will make it at least a good deal, but nope, at almost 200.00 per night during the week (with pet fee and taxes), it's definitely overpriced for the value provided.",negative
Very clean Hotel to bad corporate reservations and the hotel reservation computers don't communicate to each other SAD!!!! Have your checks and balances in order before coming to this hotel!!!!,positive
"This is a great place to stay. Reasonable pricing, clean nice rooms. The staff is great & the free breakfast very good. Has attached fine dinning and an upscale bar. It's the best Best Western I've stayed at. A big step above the others.",positive
Another pleasant stay at this hotel. Much better than you would expect for a Best Western. Nice restaurant and pub in the lobby. The hotel feels kind of like a bed and breakfast. It has a nice homey feeling.,positive
"The hotel is very pet friendly; my dog got treats in a santa stocking at checkin. My jealous husband also got a stocking with chocolate Buckeyes! Lol! The hotel is decorated beautifully for Christmas. Super, super clean!!!!! I watch hotel impossible and the host Anthony would give them five stars for sure! The back of the television set was dusted, not a speck to be found anywhere at the hotel. Staff super friendly, they are a great team and all treat the hotel as if it were ""their"" hotel. Full breakfast with waffles and such. Only one issue the garbage truck arrived next door really early, but hotel cannot do anything about that. We will be back.",positive
"I am in town for business and I'm very happy I picked this little gem of a chain hotel. I chose it based on the convenient location and just took a chance. I have a 3d floor king room ($109), which turned out to be a very spacious suite with a kitchenette and separate sitting room. It is very clean, the bed is comfy, flat screen tvs are nice (2), the check in service was very pleasant, and the lobby is lovely. There is ample parking and other than a little swishing traffic noise of cars going by, it is very peaceful and quiet in the room. There is a mall and movie theatre about 1 mile away on the same street and a number of restaurant options nearby. Altogether, very adequate accommodations.",positive
"We stayed here last night, and it couldn't have been better. Our room was lovely...we had cathedral ceilings, a very pretty vignette above our coffee/drink station (with free bottles of Perrier!). A chandelier over the bed with adjustable lighting. The bed was as high at the top of my legs and soooooo comfortable (pillows a little smaller than standard, though). Spotlessly clean. If the carpet wasn't in need of updating, you would think was a $300/night or more room...lovely furniture, gorgeously tall windows with beautiful treatments...large flat screen TV with a LOT of really GOOD channels....very nice free breakfast....restaurant was really good. The best part is the staff is all incredibly friendly. There wasn't an amenity that was missing...even had robes. Books and magazines in the room...fireplace...geesh, it was nice. I love all the personal photos and antiques from the owner that are all around. Big porch you can go out on a beautiful night and sit and enjoy. Beautiful lobby...I could keep going. This is a great place...wow!",positive
"I've stayed here about 30 times over the last two years and it's not a three star hotel. The beds are very hard and they never give you enough towels. The service is hit or miss, I've been treated very good at times from the staff but my girlfriend had an issue with the manager. If you stay here get a higher floor because if you're on the first floor the rooms above you can be very loud. It's all about location with this hotel, there are not a lot of options in Mentor. They sell out nearly every weekend so plan ahead and if you don't make your reservations a week out they will double their normal rate on you. Don't plan on saving money with their breakfast because it's really bad. Their in hotel restaurant is hit and miss, I've had nearly everything on the menu and the steak is the best thing they offer. I've been a little concerned with the freshness at times with some of their menu items.",negative
"Lovely little hotel with its distinct style...customer service people here are nice and friendly. free breakfast, it's not great but can't complain about free stuff. free coffee all day. free parking. good location - close to I-90 and the mentor mall down the street. about 25 minutes to downtown cleveland. the hotel restaurant - skye offers 10% off for guests and no surcharges for in room delivery.",positive
"Absolutely adore the Best Western Lawnfield Inn & Suites. I stayed here because on my drive from Boston to Minnesota, they were halfway & allowed my black Lab. I was surprised & charmed to find that the hotel is an addition to a Victorian home. The staff was so friendly to me and my dog that they ran out the morning we were leaving to give Woodrow, the Lab, more treats through the window of my car. I got a CHRISTMAS CARD from them this year (having stayed with them twice). A Christmas card, people. Need I say more? The only downside is that wifi works only in the lobby. But after a 12-hour drive, I found this a small price to pay--in fact a nice excuse to order in food (Mentor has a lot of delivery restaurants within range) and watch dumb TV.",positive
"We recently stayed here while attending a comedy festival at the Regent Theatre just down the street which for us out of towners was super convenient. The staff and valets were very accommodating - we arrived too early for check in, but arranged for our rooms to be made up ahead of schedule. The room was larger than expected, with a sitting area, couch, desk, refrigerator, and separated area for the beds. Only complaints (and they weren't even annoying or anything): the vending machine was out of order, the parking lot is a mess - super small. We took an Uber everywhere because we didn't feel like taking the car out. And there were lumps under the carpet in the room - felt like just bolts or something on the floor. We just walked around it. All and all would stay here again fer sure if we visited Toronto again!",positive
Love this hotel. Does not look so great outside but the hotel is clean and professionally staffed. Super comfy bed and pretty good Breakfeast. Fantastic checkin and restaurant staff. The valet parking is a tad confusing but I would stay here again.,positive
"Terrible customer service, night front desk manager needs to learn how to treat guests with respect and handle unforeseen situations a lot better. My situation eventually was handled but it took a lot of push back and I experienced a lot of profanity/negativity as well when trying to explain the reasons for my discontent. Save your money and stay somewhere else.",negative
"Surprisingly I'm shocked at some of the reviews written. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, courteous, and the amenities were great!! The only issue I had was the heat not working but its the summer so a blanket and your fine, and I preferred a nonsmoking room and was booked to a smoking room which the front desk fixed immediately. The valet is absolutely amazing very generous open and friendly. Plus the breakfast buffets were everything in the morning!! Mainly because my gf and I aren't morning ppl so this was top notch to the start of each morning during caribana. two thumbs way up for me and if you read my other reviews you'll know I'll rip a company in half through reviews if they don't service the public properly lol so this review is 100 legitimate",positive
"Kind staff and great pool. I was very pleased with the location and everything it offered. Though I have other places that I favor and were booked out, Id definitely come back.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel because it's close to our friend's place in Toronto. The hotel is just ok, it's not really good but it's not terrible either. The positive is that it's affordable and they do give you a free breakfast. Service is good too. If there was a better quality hotel in this area we would have stayed there but this was it. If you have to stay in this part of Toronto you'll be ok staying at the Best Western Roehampton, otherwise stay downtown in a nicer hotel.",negative
"Recently I had a terrible car shopping experience. No matter how much money you make, car shopping is a stressful purchase. After a bad experience, I came in not knowing what to expect, and I am so glad that it was Carl who came to my car shopping rescue. My husband and I came to look at used car, but he promised to get us an amazing, better deal on something newer. Lo and behold did Carl deliver. He was personable, knowledgeable, and not once did he make me feel like I wasn't worth his time. I loved my car shopping experience and actually look forward to the next time I'm in the market. Thank you so much for everything, can't wait to be back.",positive
"Amazing staff over here! The car buying process was stress free and easy. First time new car buyer, I was a very impressed. They took the time to make sure we were getting what we wanted and were very straight forward when it came to price. Go see Tim (he won't let you use the restroom until you buy though ) JK The 2017 Outlander GT was great!",positive
"We called on a vehicle we were interested in. Chris had it pulled up front for us to test drive right away (time saver). Additionally, Mikey helped make the whole process very simple. My husband and I agree that it was probably the most smooth buying process we have ever experienced. From arrival to final purchase we were in and out within about 3 hours. We would most certainly recommend the Big Two Mitsubishi team when purchasing your next vehicle.",positive
"Bought my new car from this dealer, and had the best experience. The sales staff weren't overly pushy and showed me only what I'd asked to see. They offered the car at a fair out-the-door price and I couldn't be happier.",positive
"Everyone here is awesome! I had the pleasure of dealing with Carl and Seth. No pressure, no up sell, straight and to the point. I live 1.5 hours away and purchased my 2016 Outlander here, so that in its self means something. Every dealer tries to sneak some added charges here, but not Big Two, which I was surprised. When I called Carl, the sales manager, to finalize my deal, he had the vehicle pulled and prepped my for delivery on this busy Memorial Day weekend right before they closed without even pulling my wife's credit and just by my words that we would qualify for the 0% for 72 months. Low and behold, when we got there, Outlander was parked right in front, washed, ready to go. He even expressed to me on call on the way up to Big Two that his day was filled with a few people with sub par credit, so In my mind he could of categorized me with those people and ask for my wife's social so they could double check before wasting everyone's time, but nothing. Wow, they took my word for it, that means alot me. It shows they really care about their customers, my son and daughter will be driving soon, I will definitely be back! We love our Outlander, Thank you Big Two!",positive
I feel like they have a great product but I hate their financing. I have a great credit score of over 800. I wish they were a reputable dealership. I will never use this dealership again,negative
"I was struggling to find a car, and was unhappy everywhere else I went. When I went to Mitsubishi, I was still skeptical on finding a car I loved. I really appreciated the friendly staff, specifically LaMont & Mo, that treated us so well. The fact that Lamont catered and showed us that he cared about us made us stay and see what deals were offered to us. And to my luck, I ended up with a brand new 2015 Lancer GT. So ask for Lamont to help you out!",positive
I Have Nothing but Good Things To Say About Them !! This is the second time I've bought a car from them at an amazing price. I compared prices and checked many other dealerships. It was fast and smooth. The guy who helped me was named Lamont Allen and he's a really nice guy and doesn't pressure you at all. I highly recommend asking for him. My name is Keith and I bought a Honda si. Let them know I sent ya in if you go. I will be back .,positive
"Giving them a 1 star because I went in on Sauterday to the service department were i was greeted by 2 kids and one of then was pointing a mesure laser pointer thing at me like a gun. And at all costs stay away from Dave the sales man. Worse attitude ever. Completely offense and is horrible at his job and apologies. Doesn't know anything about what he's selling and don't even try to talk numbers with him. He completely ruined my car buying experience. If my wife didn't like the car so much too I wouldn't have purchased. Dave was unfriendly, didn't have the right information and pushy! On the other hand... dave the finance guy was a god sent. He was so cool and even took the time to explain everything and showed us this cool way to keep intrested rates down month to month. Solid guy in my book. Carl was cool as well. I was just about to walk aboit on dave the salesman and Carl came in and saved the day he talked numbers corrected Dave on nerly everything. It turned the whole thing around and from then on i could see dave knew he was not needed or wanted there anymore but continued to. Also I was under the impression that the new lancer we test drove was for customers to test drive so I said if I buy can i have one with almost no miles on it? (First new car...Come on u want the lowest miles for sure) he got all wide eyed looking at me like I was a idiot and replied that is a new car it's a 2015 lancer! No shit Dave... I felt belittle a little by that needless to say I got one no one test drove before haha",negative
"After having my 2000 Galant repaired twice at other shops, for ignition problems, I had my car towed 120 miles to Big Two Mitsubishi. I live in Tucson and there is no Mitsubishi here, closest is Mesa AZ. I informed the service manager the this is a difficult problem and it has reoccurred twice before and the ignition coils has been replaced twice already. They went ahead and replaced the coil for the third time. I disagreed with their diagnosis but they insisted it was a bad ignition coil. 71 miles out of Mesa and the ignition started cutting in and out !!!!!! Long story short, I personally reinstalled the ignition coil that they said was defective and the engine ran fine !! Service manager Eric Fuzy won't even return my calls. Might be good cars but they don't know how to fix them",negative
Went here after a scarlet bad experience with Chapman Ford bought a new car nothing down and at the payment we wanted. The deal was done in under 2 hours!!,positive
"I despise car dealers, But these people were a joy to buy a car from. I got a decent price on a used Toyota SUV. They did all the financing and paperwork and didn't try to sell me a bunch of extras. I was in and out in a couple of hours. The sales person ken was very professional and earned my trust as did all the other employees that work there. I will certainly recommend others to shop at this dealership. I will definitely come back to them for another new or used vehicle. After having problems with other dealerships This was like a breath of fresh air. It was the best car buying experience I have had in many, many years.",positive
"In the past 10 years working as an automotive tech I have never talked to a less enthusiastic staff, I will not recommend them to people, I was in a good mood and now I feel depressed just by talking to them on the phone for 3 minutes. Someone needs to motivate these employees...",negative
"""Do not do business with them unless you like to be harassed by unwanted phone calls! I've never written this story because I am one of those, oh it's a dealership, they're all crooks. But I've decided to finally write about my experience now since they won't leave me alone. When I even owned my 2009 lancer, I took it in due to the battery corrosion. This was early 2014. They exaggerated. Told me that the corrosion went far into the cabling and that some parts were on back order from Japan and would takes over 6 weeks to get. Costs were in the thousands. I had a friend who worked on cars take a look, he order the special battery fuse replacement from a Texas dealership for about $40 and fix it as soon as it arrived in about 3-5 days. Now, I haven't even owned the lancer for about 9 months and they will not leave me alone. I've had them on my blocked list with my phone company and now I have their phone calls forwarding to a voice mail without even getting through to me since re-blocking them is annoying and I forget to keep up to date. I have spoken to one rep who advised they'd removed me from the list. A second time, I called back annoyed requesting to be removed which they kindly said they'd do. Another time, I just had it, called them back, advised that I'd already called and said I don't have the car and that I'd been told I've been removed from the call list. I told him that I'm going to report them. The guy sighed as if HE was annoyed, claimed to be a manager, and claimed to have taken care of it. Can anyone guess what happened next? I received another phone call from them so I followed through and wrote this up. I'll be posting this on BBB, Yelp, and Facebook and any other social media I can due to the company's inability to do as the customer requested. Especially when I don't even have the vehicle anymore.""",negative
"This past Wednesday we purchased a new Mitsubishi Mirage from Seth Ebeling at Big Two Mitsubishi. We had been in a few days earlier to get a feel from the dealership. Everyone we came in contact with was respectful and dealt with us with integrity. Since we were both working Wednesday Seth and his Sales Manager Chris helped do most of our entire deal over email. They even honored our private financing with no complaints even though it would have benefited them to have us use other financing. Seth and the rest of the team in sales and finance were respectful, worked hard for our business, educated us on the best deal for our financing and even filled our gas tank. We picked up the car late after work and they waited for us. We know that Seth and Chris worked long hours that day to help us. We love the car and the experience. We would recommend them to anyone!! Thank you Seth and team. We really appreciate your time and help. You know exactly what good customer service is!",positive
"After a decent experience daughters first car there we thought it would be a great experience to get another after an unfortunate accident totaled it out less than 5 months later. Boy were we wrong! They decided it would be a great opportunity to take advantage of her in her moment of need and crisis. They decided a young girl spending her own hard earned money and after a serious accident would be a ripe target to screw over. They wouldn't even honor their own prices posted in the car. Add on's and extras and additions pushed price before tax and fees well above msrp. Manger ""mo"" could have been a hero just by cutting a fair deal but instead decided he would enjoy playing the villain preying on young girls. I know they will come on to argue this so I kept their sheets and paperwork and would love to show them to the world to prove what a snake in the grass car salesman ""mo"" is. Shame on big two Mitsubishi.",negative
"I purchased a 2014 Outlander Sport at this dealership this Saturday night! It only had 4 miles! I had talked to sales manager Nissa over the phone prior to coming in. I informed her what I wanted and what color I wanted. She quoted me a price over the phone & I was hesitant but I decided to make the drive. I was also very persistent to put the 5th mile on it! Well, when I got there, the price she quoted me... was... the... SAME!!! It was the price I got. No hustle, no BS! And, I got to put the 5th mile when I test drove it! Antonio was the salesman & everything was very smooth. He was very nice and I am comfortable referring to him, and Nissa, of course! I'm very satisfied. Gary in finance was very patient because it was my first time buying a car, I needed to make sure I understood everything 100% ~ I told him I would keep him there till midnight if I had to! LOL! I went to another Mitsubishi dealership earlier that Saturday & I walked a away for a reason. Great job to the team at Big Two! Nissa, I see big success for your dealership because you work with high values and integrity.",positive
Had my vehicle serviced here.. Was given a checklist of items I should get done and wasn't pressured into getting it all done right then n there. Very happy with the respect and customer service which was given.,positive
"They quoted me a price over the internet on a new car. I arrived at the dealership only to find that they actually honored that price - unlike many of the other dealers. We drove 4 hours to get there and it was well worth the drive. The dealership was clean, the car selection was above average and the salespeople were friendly and honest. This is a top notch dealership and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase a car from them again!",positive
"And as the Assistant Manager's response indicates, the bad experience I had at Big Two apparently had nothing to do with the salesperson's abject disregard for courtesy or customer service. I guess I should not have expected to be treated with respect or professionalism. Again, I wasn't even offered the courtesy of a chair. Thank goodness I walked out and found the Mark dealerships instead! They were easy to work with and provided an excellent, almost painless (it IS still buying a car, you know!) experience. When the time comes for another vehicle, I know exactly where I will (AND WON'T) go.",negative
I bring my Chevy here to be serviced & they always do a great job. Jon is my service advisor & he is honest & so helpful! He's really a great guy & will take care of you. I recommend him all the time!,positive
I enjoyed my car shopping experience there! They were fair and very truthful! I don't get rushed or ignored!! I would go there again and again!! Korey Adams was the one that helped me out!,positive
"DO NOT COME HERE. LEFT SO DISAPPOINTED. I came here last summer to get my aluminum Specialized Allez bike tuned up for some long-distance riding. I have kept it in absolutely pristine condition. It's my baby. The owner charged me an average $45 or 50 for a tune-up (if I recall correctly). I came back the next day and was flabbergasted. There were multiple scratches, minor paint chips on the top and side tube, and oil stains that have never been there before! I was so angry, I asked the owner how they got there. He said they were already there before and just wiped the oil with a towel. Angrily, I rushed to my next appointment. In hindsight, I really should have confronted him more and asked for my money back! Absolutely POOR service. The owner and associates who work there are not welcoming, friendly, or patient at all to answer questions. Snobby attitude. Smug. Another time, I had to wait around 15-20 minutes for someone to come up to me, as I was clearly looking for help. They weren't even busy. Kinda hard to miss a customer in a 200 square foot space, my friends. I have never been back since! Perhaps they cater to a certain customer, but I don't trust these folks with my bikes. NEVER AGAIN!! I'd rather go to MEC.",negative
"Great service, and they had the right products to get me out the door and back on the road quickly. The shop is clean and bright and welcoming. With this great location at the southern tip of Kensington Market, the future looks very good for Bike House. I would not hesitate to leave my bike with these guys!",positive
"i think this is the best bike repair place in the city --- the guy works late when i brought something in last minute and always gives me a deal when i order stuff in, also never any tough guy attitude, also you never have to wait a week to get repairs done, just a good experience so ya -- i recommend ""bike house""",positive
what a joke. I just went in there because my roomate said the guy was really nice and I needed the use of a wrench to take my pedals off and he said he would do it for 6$ dollars or I could use his wrench for the minute it would take and he would charge me 5$. what a money hungry piece of crap. I was ready to really like this place but not anymore! I could buy a wrench for five bucks dummy :p,negative
"I'm not big fan of yelping but after leaving this bike shop I thought I need to write something about it. This is the BEST bike shop in Toronto. While I was building my bike I went to almost all the bike shops in the city and checked prices and products, simply took my time and search around. After I've done my research I found that there are lots of very good bike shops out there but this one was the best over all and Javier the guy who runs this shop was extremely helpful, generous and nice and let me use some of the tools plus gave lots of helpful advices. This shop is highly recommended. They got new bikes and sometimes used parts for less then half of the price.",positive
"The guy who runs this place takes a lot of pride in his craft. You can buy a bike lock here and he installs it for just a few dollars extra. Pay the extra, because bike locks, bike handles and bike seats can be really hard to install, even for a professional. Friendly guy, grateful for your business and his prices are low.",positive
This place is the best and no one seems to know about it. Anything that needs fixing is done quickly and honestly for a low cost. It's the only place I take my bike!,positive

We came here on July 3. It was crowded and since it was a holiday week-end some of the staff had been taken that week for vacation so they were short staffed. Our server was handling half the dining room by herself and did an outstanding job. I think her name was Eileen but I'm not sure. there was a party of 10 seated behind us and I think that threw the kitchen off. We did have to wait 45 minutes for food but we understood that the kitchen was stretched as far as it could be so we didn't really care. Our server checked on us several times and apologized for the long wait as if it were her fault. She was just caring and cheerful around all of her customers. The food was average for a chain restaurant where the recipes are preset. We didn't expect anything really special and were not disappointed. All in all a good experience for a chain restaurant.,positive
Dirty. Poor service....lots of staff just standing around while customers wait. Greeter didn't even acknowledge our presence ....just mumbled under her breath if there 2 of us then walked away. Food has gone down hill big time. Everything was bland. It's been a while since we've eaten here....can't say we will be coming back.,negative
Good food but prices are high for a Bob Evans. They've repeatedly messed up online orders which is disappointing. Staff is nice but in a small crowded parking area. Very convenient location. It's right at highland rd and route 8,positive
Bob Evans' Restaurants have really gone down hill -- just horrible. Their products in the grocery stores are unhealthy and full of poisonous hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup. Bob Evans sold his business and the new owners have really made his name look bad. I recently had the sausage gravy and for some reason it was brown and not the creamy white gravy that it should be and it lacked any sausage bits - unbelievable. My eggs that were cooked over easy were cooked in some sort of clear oily possibly trans-fatty hydrogenated shortening -- gross. The oil was clear like baby oil -- eewww and had a chemical taste to it. This used to be a great place to go to. Now I avoid it an cringe when I hear its name. Cracker Barrel is putting them out of business. These new owners are not only killing the business but they are ruining the good name of Bob Evans. Bob Evans used to stand for quality but not anymore. They need to get back to natural home-cooked on the farm meals.,negative
"Eat at Bob Evans at least once a week. Usually after church on Sunday. Always busy when we arrive, but never wait more than 15 minutes to get seated. Food is almost always good. Serving time on occasion is slow even without a crowd. Wait help are always friendly and helpful. A good place for a meal or dessert anytime. Great coffee! Craig K.",positive
Hostess are 100% unorganized. Given a 15 minute wait time with one other party of 2 siting and waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting and watching other people after U.S. Get seated I said some thing. They said we where next. Well we weren't 30 more minutes went by. Spoke to a manager who cleared a table for us taking an additional 10 minutes. Then the unbelievable happened the hostesses sat another party at the table the manager cleared. The party they seated they seated couldn't believe it as well and quickly offered their seats to us. We said thank you but turned it down and then left without being served.,negative
ZERO stars!!! Waited an hour for the food..people that came in after us got their food way before us..and they did nothing to compensate us for the hour and a half wasted time of my life I will not get back!!! SUCKED SUCKED SUCKED!!!!!! it made me put a star before I could post it...negative 5 stars,negative
"If there was an option for less than one star, I'd go with that. This Bob Evans is dirty and slow. I ordered a salad without the chicken. Watched them pick the chicken off when they realized they goofed. When the server brought the salad out I asked about it, she said they made a new salad. After I found chicken still in the salad, I sent it back. It's unfortunate that this area is so limited with restaurant options. But this is definitely the last time we waste our time here.",negative
"I've frequented this restaurant for many years. Last three visits I got sick! Same problem every time The runs, and I'm being nice. Definitely helped being fast on my feet... What's up? Perhaps a call to the Summit County Health Department.",negative
"I haven't been to Bob Evans for a few years. My friend suggested the 3 course meal would be a good idea. I got a potato crusted flounder with fruit, he got a blackened steak with sweet potato. We got raspberry vinagrette salads, sundaes and some bread. :) yeah 5 types of bread, unbeatable, they gladly accept vouchers. The staff is friendly, very clean, double wiping tables. Service is quick and courteous. Family style food, good conversation. :) Also feel like a kid again coming here~~",positive
Customer service it top notch at this Bob Evans Restaurant. Hostess rewashed our table as she didnt likw the way it looked. Even wiped the menus before giving them to us. Waitress was very attentive. Evan asked if I wanted a coffee to go. We have never had this high quality of service at any other Bob Evans. Kudos to your staff for all your hard work. Keep up the amazing job. Oh.. and the food was very good too. Bob & Karen,positive

I am a big fan of eating breakfast for Dinner and this is the place to go to. Bob and Jewell Evans really knew what they were doing. Food is outstanding love the atmosphere and its a great family place. Breakfast Lunch or Dinner........,positive
This location is a sweet Get Away that is 20 minutes from the busy Las Vegas Strip. The sky and air is clear filled with stars and only the sounds of the animals and nature fill the air at night. I love the nostalgia of this place. I got a room where the carpet looks like a wood floor and the room is large. It is peaceful and feels like your on a vacation with no one else around. The Old Town is awesome and has stories of ghost hauntings and I love all the animals. Great place to bring your kids for history and entertainment. Everyone is nice here. This is a great place to get away from the city. I live in Hollywood and from Texas so I appreciate this place.,positive
Very cool spot. The reason for the 4* rating is because of the lady out by the horse stables who clearly doesn't work here. Acting like she's in charge. Some people need to learn to stay in there lane. Mind your own f$@)ing business. She's lucky I had my kids with me. Otherwise she would have gotten served.,positive
"At one time this may have been a more than a run down tourist trap. Last weekend seven of us visited the restaurant and had to ask that four of the plates be replaced because they were splattered with food or coffee. This made us suspect, so we only ordered bottled drinks and fries",negative
"Went hiking at Red Rock yesterday and decided to go check out Bonnie Springs after the hike. This place is really cool. I loved the old western theme as you pull in. They also had a cool train that picks you up from the parking lot that takes you to the western town. That was fun . We made our way towards the restaurant and bar. As you walk into the bar there are dollar bills hung everywhere with patrons that have visited. I thought that was really unique. We ate in the restaurant side. I ordered a glass of wine and chicken wings. Kind of pricey bit the wings were delicious . Cooked perfectly, crispy the way i like it and not to spicy. The service was good too. They were very friendly. I really enjoyed myself. I saw they had a free petting zoo but i never had a chance to check it out. I will for sure on my next visit and I definitely will be back.",positive
"My family and I have been to Vegas multiple times and were looking for something non strip related to entertain our whole party of mostly older adults. I came across this brochure, we had a car and it was reasonably priced so it seemed like something worthy of checking out. Its also located in the Red Rock Canyon which is a place I had been wanting to check out forever. Our brochure even had a coupon for 2$ off the admission price of 10$. The brochure didn't give as much info as we needed, but we were able to check the website and learn about the current hours and dark days (no shows) on the website. Make sure you check the show times as this is a huge part of the fun of going here, and it would be a shame to come and miss out on this. The ride out here was beautiful, being from Washington State we do not have similar mountains or vegetation. I really wanted to stop to get my picture with a cactus on the driveway to the ranch, but no one thought I was serious. The train outside also allowed for some photo opportunities as well, but beware it only runs on the weekends. We enjoyed being greeted by some town folk immediately after entering Old Town. My family enjoys interactive events and loved that you could engage with the actors in both the town and the shows. The shows themselves were surprisingly entertaining, but you may want to bring some sunscreen and water for the hanging as it is in the direct sun. Afterwards the wax museum opens and you can look at some famous figures from how the Old West came to be. We didn't understand that this was guided and missed hearing most of what was being said. It would definitely be worth a 2nd look as the guide went through very fast and we didn't have much time for pictures or reading the signage. The old buildings are cool to look at, but a little run down as can be expected in any ghost town. The Old West Museum was also cool to look at. I hope to check out the ghost adventures episode about the paranormal activity here, but was able to ask the actors about it while there. The actors are very helpful and had lots of information about both Bonnie Springs and even great recommendations for places to check out in Vegas and the surrounding area. We checked out the stores as well. My Aunt was happy with her cheap purse, my Uncle kept raving about the prices and I felt like I scored with some 3$ earrings. It would have been cool if the shooting gallery was in working order, but still fun to look at. If I ever go again I hope to make it in October for Bonnie Screams and to check out the restaurant.",positive
just left the restaurant and was waited on by a short tattooed Latino who lacked charm! He rudely asked one of the guest not to fold the menu and snatched it out of his hand because it might tear! He also brought me a lemonade when I asked for ice tea and made an extra remark that he doesn't recall me asking for ice tea as he would've asked which flavor!! additionally when I ordered the gizzard and veggie appetizer he made a comment that he doesn't understand why some people that come here don't order real homemade food and lastly he forgot to bring my veggie appetizer! He needs to get his head out of the cloud and come down to earth! we were generous enough to give him 5% tip.,negative
Great place to get a bison burger. Prices are decent and quality of food are constant. I will always dine here as long as the service and food stay the same. On a cold night the restaurant has a nice fire going.,positive
"The photos speak for themselves here, I mean what else is there to say? We've stayed here twice...the first time we got a regular room because I was trying to stay within a budget. This time we splurged and got a themed room w/ jetted hot tub. I didn't know, but it came with a complimentary bottle of champagne. WINNING. I love this place. The family at the check in desk are funny and witty and just all around welcoming and polite. It's beautiful all times of year with the majestic Red Rocks surrounding. I hope we get to go on a Horseback Ride this time. If not, excuse to come back soon! Clean. Big beds. Large jetted hot tub with plenty of mirrors! Lots of pillows. Intricate lighting. Nearby petting zoo and horse stables. Big shower with seats.",positive
"We came to ride horses and chew gum, and we were all out of gum. But seriously folks, the staff who conduct the horse rides are nothing short of awesome. Super friendly, patient, informative, and earnestly want to know if you have any questions. The youngest in our group had a melt down when it came time to saddle up and it was looking like one of the adults was going to have to hang back but the staff preempted that event before it became an issue. Still not sure how they managed to pull that off but when you have kids, sometimes it is useful to have some third party authority around. The ride itself was breath taking in the foothills of the canyon on federal land literally line of sight of red rock canyon. We saw cacti, desert flora, brush, we saw beautiful colors, canyons, clouds, sky, sand, wild deer, rocks, and petrified trees. It was a wonderful experience and one I highly encourage. Our group of youngins in tow can be a real cantankerous bunch at times and every single one of them had a smile on their face and listed it as one of their fave parts of the trip. If you look online, you can even find a $5 off coupon - http://www.vegas4locals.com/coupons/dining-and-nightlife/bonnie-springs-ranch/ I cannot stress first impressions enough though. Bonnie likes to have you sign up for horse back riding in the bar. Which when you have a group of kids is awkward because they have to be in the dining room while you are in the bar. And they are really strict about this no kids in the bar policy. We had a party of 8 and figured we would grab some apps before the ride. We ended up parking the kids around the fire pit in the restaurant while we did paperwork in the bar. The bar tender with the tatt sleeves came off a bit gruff initially. I am sure it is no picnic for him to have to be responsible for the paperwork AND the bar but I did not make those rules. When you are dropping around $300 you want to feel the love. And he was very particular about how the paper work was filled out and by whom. There's also a whole lot of signing going on, both at the bar, and at the stable. So make sure you allow yourself a sufficient amount of time to navigate that mess. We did not have time to order any food that was significant but I can tell you that both the chili loaded fries and the corn fritters with honey were pretty darn tasty.",positive
"The food looks good, but don't bother waiting to be seated. Seems the way to go is to push your way past the hostess station and just grab a seat. After two full parties behind us helped themselves to tables and the rude, overwhelmed waitresses served them despite knowing we were waiting, we finally just left. Womp womp.",negative
"So My family and I Came out here to eat at the Restaurant and we didn't do much walking around so I cannot Comment on the Ranch itself, But The Restaurant HOWEVER, The lighting in there is so horrible we had to ask to move to be able to see our dinner, and than a party of 3 ppl came in and sat at the table we left at and had to use there cell phones as lights to see the menu, The food is okay, I got the buckin burger, my mom got the fish and chips, and my wife got the famous Bonnie springs burger and they all tasted un- seasoned and bland, I don't expect a 5 star meal from a place like this but at least put some salt on the food, Our server was awesome that was the only good side of this, My overall complaint is the lighting in the restaurant, I could barley see anything, They really need to fix that because no one wants to eat in the dark, Its almost like they don't want you to see the food they give you .",negative
"This place gets one star because the food is ... well... barely definable as food, and the service is horrendous. Perhaps it was ok once, but it is not worth a stop much as well putting down any money as of January 2015. Avoid it like Ebola.",negative
"The only reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the restaurant. The actual town and zoo its self gets a 3 star. I have been going to Bonnie Springs since 1988 and yes the place is a little worse for wear but it's old. The actors are nice and will sit and talk with you in between shows. The petting zoo use to be much bigger but it is still good that animals are still a part of this place. What really sucks is that this place is not open on Mondays, it's only open Wednesday through Sunday Ok now the restaurant part They have redone the menu but that is not always s good thing. We were seated and it took about 5 minutes for someone to come over to us and ask us for drinks. We were sitting there for another 10 minutes and a group of 6 come in, no big deal it's not busy in there anyways. We finally ordered a starter along with our meal. Almost 15 minutes later the group gets served exactly what we ordered as our starter, they got ours and now we have to wait yet again for another to be made. WOW!!!!! I got the fish & chips meal and I DO NOT recommend it to anyone that has taste buds. The fish needs to be seasoned and not mushy. Put a little bit of lemon pepper on it for GODs sake. It left a bad taste in my mouth. My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was ok and it was dry, at least put more BBQ sauce on it before you serve it or put some on the side. Our waiter shouldn't have been at work today because serving is his job and he lacked those skills. My 10 year old could have done it better. Customer service in the restaurant needs so much improvement!!!!",negative
"Went There to enjoy a hot chocolate at the end of the day ... Nobody was at the entrance to seat us so we seated by ourself ... Waiting for 15 mins, the waitress wasn't coming because was mad we seated ???? ... Was very rude and impolite from the start to the end, throwing the bill on the table And looking at us in a mean way !!! Very disappointed, this place is fun and I'm sure this ranch was made with big heart but if they want to keep it alive they should treat the customers better !!!",negative
Just showing up and finding designated parking was a treat. After riding the loop we were excited to finally get to our destination which was highly recommended by others. This place is nestled in the red rock canyon,positive
Very neat little place tucked into the dessert. Try the bison burger and raspberry tea. Also very friendly staff. My husband and I added a dollar to the bar ceiling (you sign the money & it goes to charity). Overall nice oasis!,positive
"It sounds like if we went on the weekend we might have given another star. But we didn't. The town is staffed by two guys, and everything is closed and locked as a result. One of the workers told me they couldn't have the buildings open because of vandals. I understand that, but sounds like you need more staff. The train doesn't run and there is no posse show on weekdays. The petting zoo is okay, but I would have liked to see more local wildlife there, although wallabies are cool. I did have a deer start to eat my shirt, which the kids were thrilled by. Perhaps if they didn't charge full price on weekdays I would have been more understanding of half the features being unavailable. We likely won't be back.",negative
"We were looking for an event venue for a very large group and when we came across BSR on the internet we inquired about the services. Karin was extremely helpful! Even though we didn't end up booking there, Karin's knowledge and help was in valuable! Thank you Karin, for being patient and wonderful with us!",positive
Went to Bonnie Springs today. The old town experience was a bit disappointing but ok if you have dome time and want to get out of Vegas for the day. The restaurant had that old Western feel and the food-typically saloon style wasn't bad. I had the ranch sampler and my pardoner had the bison burger which he said was tasty. We shared a home made cherry pie al mode which was really nice.,negative
"Cute little place to take the kids. Theres a petting zoo, a ""wild west town"" (more like a street, but there are shops to poke around in), and a restaurant which we didnt try. Theres also a pretty nice train ride. Its kind of run down, but thats appropriate for the theme, so we didnt mind. Its cooler up here near the mountains and windier too so bring a sweater!",positive
"I love this place, a great place to just hang. Food was fair, but our server was great, quick and always there when we wanted something (not that overbearing type.) I had the BBQ chicken, must have been half a bird, took it home for my next lunch. We went for supper following doing the drive and hike at Red Rock Canyon. Perfect eveing!",negative
"I have to say - had I written this review last year it would probably have been three stars. The ambiance has ALWAYS been there - great little lake view - feeding ducks - great roaring fire in the winter - rustic and relaxing however the food wasn't ever very good (save the amazing hot chocolate and bread pudding). And I'm talking we've been going here for maybe 20 or more years. My family and I went recently (June 2012) and I have to say the food quality was GREATLY improved! I'm happy to say it because I love going to this place and getting out of the city. We got the BBQ ribs, chicken friend steak, salmon, hot chocolates and bread pudding. From the moment the salad got there I could see the difference in the food quality just from a year ago. VERY fresh salad with garbanzos, ripe lovely grape tomatoes, baby corn, carrots etc. Really good. Ribs were good, chicken fried steak had the BEST gravy on it (and you know white gravy is hard to do well), salmon was 'ok' a bit fishy for my taste but very flavorful and seasoned well and of course the bread pudding and hot chocolate NEVER disappoint. Our waitress - I wish I remembered her name, was AWESOME - she was refilling before we even asked, pleasant and on the ball. (UPDATE: Her name was JASMINE - she's the BEST) I'm happy to be able to write this review. The food is MUCH better than year's past so if you haven't been in a while - make the trip! :) It's worth it.",positive
love this rustic redtraunt..great food..great atmosphere..great drinks. Amazing dinner bread n ranch dressing...yumm..been here more then 30 times..the stesk dinner for 2 is a great deal and filling!,positive
"Cute as a button. A nice little drive, just past the Red Rock Hotel (east of the Strip 12-15 miles). Bonnie Springs is a little touristy, okay a lot, but I like the drive so very much just getting here (you'll also be passing Red Rock mountains...which is AWESOME and a must-stop!). In the little itsy-bitsy town, it features a Bates-like motel, a general store, and a petting zoo...but I like to sit at the little restaurant bar and get a nice frosty sarsparella on a hot day. It would be fun to wear a cowboy hat, a leather vest, chaps, boots, and stir-ups...and talk like a Texan, but thank God just a t-shirt and shorts are welcome on those blistering hot, Vegas summer days. Most fun would be to get some buds together and dress up like the Village People, but I digress. PS. Very kid-friendly.",positive
"For a restaurant that is in the middle of no where, surrounded with animals and mountains. I find this place to be very interesting and unique. Bonnie Springs Restaurant, located far west off Charleston and Gunfighter. Since its way out there, it's not as big of a restaurant but a decent size. The outside of it, is well maintained, even though it does look run down. But inside is very nice and kept clean. A bit confusing at first, since, we weren't sure where the entrance was, cause the doorway was kind of small and unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait for the waitress. But the place was busy, and it seem like it's a popular place. Then again, we went during lunch hours, so I'm sure it was busy cause of that. The waitress was very nice and friendly, and seated us close to the fire place. I find it interesting and unique that the tables were made like it was cut out from a tree. The wooden seats, could be a bit more comfortable, but it wasn't as bad. Since it was lunch hours, it did take a while to get the waitress to take our orders. I don't mind the wait, as long as there's a reason for a waitress to be late. Of course, being lunch hours, it's quite understandable. When the waitress came around, I ordered the pull pork sandwich, that came with coleslaw and fries. I got my food at a reasonable time. I did eat almost everything on my plate and find it very fulfilling and tasty. The pull pork was nice and tender, the bread of the sandwich was nice and soft. Wasn't to fond of the fries, but It was edible. (I'm not much of a french fry guy, cause of the grease its cooked in. But I do love bake potatoes.) Overall, if you are in the area, don't hesitate to stop in the restaurant. It may look run down on the outside, but very decent looking inside. Make sure you bring your appetite. For a small restaurant, they sure serve you with big portions. They even have a pond out front that has turtles. So before or after you eat, you should check them out too.",positive
"Worth the short drive. This place is really cool. No fee to get to the restaurant. Duck pond next to it. Also, many peacocks around. You can look at horses, ponies, a long horn steer, and buffalo. The place has a real old-timey feel. A huge fire fit inside. Great for just hanging out. They had live music when we arrived. Simply wonderful atmosphere. We shared a Bonnie Springs Burger, which had 1/2 lb of meat. The food was slightly better than mediocre and a little over priced. Like I said, its worth the drive just to enjoy the atmosphere.",positive
It is tough to tell if this place is genuine old west country charm or if it is just kinda run down out in the country... I think it is just kinda run down and sorta gross. You definately want to love this place because it has history and lotsa potential. The owners of this place can do better. The oldwest town and trail rides are good for the kids but this is about the restaurant. The food is basic bar food with a few wild game selections. I had a barbecue pork sandwich that was barely ok. The restaurant was very dirty. You can have old west country carm with out being gross. They have a ranch like area right outside the restaurant where you can walk around. Peacocks walking around. The have an American Bison in a tiny little coral and it looked sick. They had a water tub full of dirty gross water. They had no shelter for it. Not even a damn tree to get away from the 100 degree heat! I don't think the poor thing could even move. It was sad to see an animal like that penned up for show at some dumpy local attraction... This isn't a chicken or a pig - this is an American Bison! MAybe Yelpers can stage a late night ... Bison Break-out and set him free!!!! He can run with the burros! The nicest thing I can say is the service was fast and friendly.,negative
"I have been coming to Bonnie Springs for years and years. Little has changed, and a lot has stayed the same. This place is an ""experience"". Come with an open mind, while the sun is still up if possible and bring walking shoes. Bonnie Springs is an old dude ranch/motel/old town museum/petting zoo/restaurant/bar etc. etc. It's sort of hard to describe really. If you come during daylight hours you can walk around and see some of the birds and maybe the wild burros that live on the land. At night, it is not advised to wander around in the dark - the burros are mean. The bar is fun - no neckties allowed. If you enter wearing one, you are given two choices - either remove it, or it will be cut off, and hung on the wall. There is a big stone woodburning fireplace with chairs all around that is perfect for puting your boots up and having a beer while you wait for a table. The food is wonderful - simple menu, wholesome, basic meat and potatoes menu that can't be beat. After a day in the saddle, sit down with friends and a hearty apetite. The salad is fresh and crisp, the ranch style potato is delicious, and the steaks are all divine. Service is unobtrusive, friendly. If you want another side of Las Vegas (25 minutes outside of Vegas), this feels like a million miles away!",positive
"We went here after hiking in Red Rocks and it was fantastic. The burgers are great but besides the food, the service is top notch. Victoria was our server and even though it was her first day, she came off as though she had been there for years and we were regular customers. We plan on making this a traditional stop when we come to Vegas and really hope you do too.",positive
"We saw the chapel on our last visit to Bonnie Springs. That would be an interesting place to have a wedding, in my opinion. Not exactly my cup of tea, but there is an ass for every saddle, right? I wrote a more detailed review about Bonnie Springs, which I am pasting here: ""My friend first introduced us to Bonnie Springs one day on a drive out to Red Rock Canyon. Since then, we have returned a few times with other guests on the way to one of our favorite hiking spots. My friend first told us he was taking us to the ""demented animal farm"". He said that this place takes in all types of animals, including ones that have been injured or abandoned in the desert over the years. We are talking everyting from deer, hogs and wolves to exotic animals like the Australian Lynx. They even have a peacock. When we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals. There was an old western town, a train, a small motel, a pond with ducks, and a restaurant. All of that on top of a large (and growing) section of animals. What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere! The animals are my favorite. Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals. Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely. One deer, in particular, ate food from my hand as he stood next to me in the corridor. I would say that this place is safe for children, but know in advance that this is not like a zoo. Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven. I did not see any ""demented animals"" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma. I always donate a few dollars. Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals. The old western town is interesting. Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went. We had one funny thing happen here. We went into the candy store to look around. My nephew wanted a chocolate bar. As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor. I didn't say anything. When we got outside and he opened his milk chocolate bar, we were all horrified to find it was completely white! Have you even seen brown chocolate turn white? I told my nephew to keep it as it may be an artifact. Overall, this place is a trip. Truly worth a quick visit if you are passing through, but I wouldn't plan a day around it.""",negative
"I cannot fully express how professional and wonderful I felt after getting my hair done at this studio.I came in with yellow/brass balayage which was so horrible and I needed some major help. I could not have asked for better stylist anywhere. Breanna stuck with me through the entire 9 hr process and Alicia is a true gem. Book an appointment asap, this studio is fantastic",positive
"Great experience last Friday at Bravo. I did a TON of on line research to find a great haircut . Theo was WONDERFUL! Also my husband get a great cut with Jessica. Definitely going back, everyone friendly and professional. Thank you!",positive
Best salon!! Everyone in the salon is so welcoming every time I come in. Theo is AMAZING!! So knowledgeable and has helped me transform my hair!,positive
"Ive been going here since 2012 or 2013 and don't plan on ever leaving. I think women know that once you find a hair dresser you completely trust, you'd practically travel to India for your appointment. Well, thats at least how I feel about my hair. I originally came to Elena for a color fix when I transitioned from about a level 2-3 back to a golden blonde. My old hair stylist didn't quite nail it and I was unhappy with the ""tinny"" look. Elena new exactly how to fix it and I was super pleased with how it turned out. And I do know, that if you're not happy with anything, they make it right-free of charge. Ive been dark blonde with highlights and Ive gone from being light to a chocolate brown to pretty much black. Elena and Alicia have nailed it every time. (Alicia is the owner and Elena is her amazing daughter who comes once every month or so from out of state now) I cant tell you how great they are, especially when it comes to color. Alicia and Elena know their $h*t when it comes to that, so if your transitioning or making a big change, Id recommend Bravo salon and making an appointment with Alicia. You'll probably end up being a consistent client once you go there. All of the other stylists are very friendly, but my experience has only been with Alicia and her daughter. Excellent customer service. And they send you text reminders a week in advance and the day of your appointment, which I love since my schedule is pretty busy.",positive
"Love this place. Stumbled upon it when I was looking to get a Keratin treatment a couple of years ago. I had been unhappy with another salon's service so tried here. Was not disappointed! Kim did the treatment and it came out great! I have gone back for treatments every 6 months or so. On occasion the timing is such that Kim also does my color. Always looks wonderful. I also drop by, when I am feeling lazy, for a wash and blowout. I am always able to get an appointment the same day. Kim usually does my hair but one day she wasn't in and Kristen did it. Came out looking fantastic. This place is just great, very welcoming and warm. I am going to have my husband try them for a haircut and he is picky.",positive
"Time to freshen up my look! Bravo Salon is the best place to go in Scottsdale if you want top notch hair salon services. I rely on Inigo to keep my hair color ""current"" and spice it up once in awhile with highlights. He is a master at his craft and always listens to his clients about their goals and recommends what cut/color/treatment will work best. Today I am in desperate need to spruce up a washed out look. In addition to a color update Inigo recommended a glaze and deep conditioning. Michele took great care of me as well with a relaxing shampoo,glaze & conditioning process. The results are awesome! Thank you, Inigo and Michele! I highly recommend Bravo Salon!",positive
I LOVE Stephanie and everyone there is so nice! I walked in sometime in September with my hair butchered ... The receptionist knew exactly who to place me with and Stephanie has been amazing! I will always follow! Deann,positive
"This smallish salon employs the BEST hair stylists. My hair was ruined due to over bleaching. They totally restored my hair. These people are experts and I totally trust them bleaching my hair. They changed my mousy blonde hair into a beautiful shining blonde. They are skilled in a process called Balliage. I also get a keratin treatment which makes my hair look great. I trust them to do any process on my hair.Theo is my stylist. She is from NYC, and keeps educated on all the current styles, trends, and techniques. She can make anyone look great! I can't say enough good things about Theo. She worked magic on me. I am very grateful to Theo for restoring my damaged hair and turning it into get into beautiful hair that people constantly complement me on.",positive
Theo did a great job with my keratin treatment and was incredibly knowledgable. The receptionist was so friendly and even gave me an additional coupon for my treatment. Salon was clean and had up to date magazines to read.,positive
WOW!! What a find! This Salon is amazing. Theo is incredible and I have never loved my hair so much. The cut is fabulous and I love the Balayage. She is so detail oriented! This salon is a MUST!,positive
"I had all over color, partial Baylage highlights and a haircut with Brianna several weeks ago. She listens to what you want and pays attention to detail. The reason for the 3 stars is due to price. At over $300, for most, the affordability is unrealistic. Brianna did a decent job but I'm afraid I have to keep on looking for a fairly priced hairstylist.",negative
"Theo is the best stylist ever! She is a Master! She did a Keratin on me which made my hair smooth and shiny. She then did Balayage with beautiful blond swirling color. No lines,as with foils. She is extremely knowledgeable on how to color blond hair safely without damage. She is a miracle worker! Her years of experience in NYC shows!",positive
"I have been salon hopping for over 20 years. When I finally found Alicia, owner and Master Stylist at Bravo Salon, my luck must have turned. I showed up with hair the color of a penny, not intentionally, and she was able to get all the brassiness out (which noone was ever able to do), and get my hair to a beautiful beige color and I will never go anywhere else again. She, and her staff are so knowledeable, consice and extremely educated that I would recommend to anyone to go to Bravo Salon.",positive
"The owner needs to hire a receptionist since she obviously cannot cater to customers in a timely fashion. Called for an appointment (would have been my 2nd time there) and she never bothered to return my call. Called again, she put me on hold for 5 minutes and I just hung up. I had earlier left a message for a 10am appt., she then sends an email confirming an 11am appt. Sorry for the stylist I had requested, would have loved to had my hair colored and cut by her but the owner ruined it.",negative
"I absolutely love going there! I always receive top of the line service and treatment ! The stuff is very friendly,professional and pleasant. I love to hear Trudy's voice every time I call to make an appointment. She is the voice of the Salon. All the stylists are fantastic. Alicia Bravo is the owner of Bravo Salon, a Creative Director Master Stylist. I always book my appointments with her. I can't imagine anyone else being my hairdresser. That is why after moving to California I still go back to Scottsdale and Bravo Salon to get my hair done by Alicia. I highly recommend this upscale Salon to all the ladies, that would like to look like Superstars every time they leave Bravo Salon !!!",positive
I've had a wonderful experience multiple times at this salon! Kristen is wonderful. She listens to exactly what you want. She does a beautiful job! Thanks for making my hair gorgeous.,positive
After going to this salon for over 6 years I have never been disappointed. Fabulous results for my cut and color every time! Keep up the good work over there!,positive
"I recently had a brand new style and was not happy with the way it looked on me. I asked for a couple of adjustments. Bravo gladly allowed me to come back to their Salon and my stylist. Ellena worked with me and made a couple of tweeks. Please remember, that not all styles look good on all people. If anyone is like me, I am extremely picky and hope that I look my best. I am not a beautiful woman. I try to be pretty, but it does not always work out. ( oh well ) I can now style my hair easily and I am very happy with the results. Thank you Ellena for working with me. Also, I would like to thank you for reaching out as I requested. Your pride in your work shows when you make a point to contact your customers. Dee :-)",positive
"I have been going to Elena for Brazilian blow-out for about 3 years. She does a great job. Having a number of options from which to choose (unlike many other salons), she tailors the treatment to your specific hair and desired degree of straightness. Not only is Elena highly skilled and professional, she is also very personable, and attuned to her customer. The whole atmosphere of the salon is friendly and professional - from the greeting when you enter, to the entire experience.",positive
"I've been going here since moving to the East Valley last year. I couldn't find anyone else who worked with my curly hair as well as Jessica has. No matter if I decide to straighten it later or decide to keep it natural, it looks beautiful. Jessica is friendly, a conversationalist, and knows what she's doing with my hair. She always gives me great tips every time I come in to make my hair look good outside the salon. I recently moved to Chandler (temporarily). I don't even want to find another place here, it's definitely worth the 40 minute drive for now to get my hair looking great!",positive
"I am a hair stylist with 32 years experience. Since moving from New York to Arizona I have had nothing but bad luck having my own hair cut. I walked in nervous and explained that I hadn't had my hair cut in months because I was afraid of being butchered again. I was introduced to Suzanne who immediately put my mind at ease. The consultation was excellent and thorough, she was engaging and personable. I am thrilled with my haircut and will continue to see Suzanne as I know I can trust her to listen and give me an awesome cut and style. Thank you so much for the experience. Happy, happy, happy!!! :-) Thank you Suzanne.",positive
"12-17-13 Unfortunately, Alicia (owner of Bravo Hair Salon) falls short of professional behavior and fails to provide quality customer service. Appointments are cancelled last minute and clients are not offered service options with other stylists / colorists to accommodate Alicia's sudden and unexpected cancelations. Additionally, I have found Bravo's receptionist (Trudy) to be defensive and confrontational when addressing concerns regarding the salon's last minute cancellations. Trudy's inappropriate communication with clients and poor customer service skills is unacceptable and certainly damages the opportunity for salon growth and repeat business. Although Alicia Bravo ""talks the walk"" specific to quality services and good customer care, she apparently fails to ""walk the talk"". ""Actions speak louder than words Bravo Salon""!",negative
Wouldn't recommend this salon---had a bad experience which cost me a lot of $$$$ Overpriced for a Stylist that calls herself a Master Stylist---Sorry but a Master Stylist should be someone with years of experience--10-15!!! Hair Stylists are the only professionals who get by with very little accreditation.....Not pleased with results.,negative
"This is the second time I've been here, and what can I say exceptional service! Over the top! I was very impressed the first time I came in with high level of professionalism, customer service, and hair services this salon has to offer. First time I was there I got a Brazilian Blowout. However over time my hair reverted back sooner than I thought which I was pre warned about how long the straightener lasts by my stylist Elena. I came back to see Elena again because I needed a stronger straightener that lasts longer. Elena did that and more! I love my new look, and I'm extremely content with the service. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for an upscale, high end salon that knows how to make it happen! Oh and btw, when you check-in on yelp you get a $150 towards your Brazilian Blowout.",positive
I stumbled upon Bravo looking for a specific technique in hair coloring. I go back to Phila. every 2 or 3 months to get it done. But I couldnt get there in April and was heading to Hawaii. I read up on Inigo (gentleman stylist). I did read all the Yelp's feedback as well..but I went with my gut on this guy. I must say...he is PHENOMENAL! I have gone to several of the top upscale hair salons in Philadelphia and Scottsdale!...he highlighted my hair the best yet! My old colorist from PA...may have lost a customer:) He is just GREAT! And my experience with the own...fine. But really he is the STAR and gem in this little shop! He rivals top NYC and LA stylist! I am heading back this week!,positive
"the owner of this salon keeps negating her bad reviews by saying that we are past, disgruntled employees or that yelp filters out the positive reviews. i can assure you i have never worked at her salon, or any salon for that matter, and don't know why she keeps commenting on my reviews. i think this is her third time defending herself, pointlessly, i might add. if you notice, my review was written last may 2011. she really needs to get over it. if she spent more time listening to these reviews and gaining insight from unhappy customers, perhaps she could make the changes she needs. she has an excuse for everything, so please alicia, don't waste your time responding anymore, and go improve your business, so people like myself, won't have anything bad to report. oh yeah, and one more thing, i just saw another person complain about their massage and facial, and alicia, once again, had a comment saying that they don't do massages or facials, that they are a hair salon. well, now she is a liar too, because i also had a facial and massage there. check out the groupon, it included all of that. perhaps she discontinued them after so many people complained, but she definitely offered them at one time. look at all the people on here that said they had one. do you think we are ALL lying? strange!",negative
"2.5 Stars My girlfriend and I both used Groupon's for the massage. We both had the same opinion. On the positive: the place was kind of cute, friendly staff, and great location. The massage, well, that's a different story. First off, the lighting stunk. There were no candles, instead a small chandelier strategically placed to shine right in the client's eyes lying on the massage table. The music fluctuated between classical piano and a score from a slasher film. The room was a little stuffy and the heavy covers didn't help. My masseuse was very nice and helpful, but I just didn't care for the way she applied her craft. For me, the best way to describe her style is new age herky jerky. She just didn't have a soft touch. It just wasn't smooth or relaxing and also not enough pressure for me. Overall, it was below average experience. Actually, it was kind of a waste of time. Here's to not wasting yours - steer clear of Bravo Salon massages even with a Groupon.",negative
"Though some of the reviews about Bravo Salon concerned me, I decided to make an appointment anyway. This was a mistake and in short, my hair was ruined. If you do decide to take a chance on this salon, keep in mind that they absolutely care more about being right than they do the client. Somehow the owner and others working there have not learned how to do business with integrity. I usually remain objective when reading most negative reviews but in this case, the negative reviews prove to be right on.",negative
"Disappointed. I met with Alicia to discuss my coloring needs. She referred me to Rachel. I asked specifically not to have a toner put on after the highlights; that I wanted to keep my natural hair color including the gray as much as possible and just have the highlights on the regrowth. Once Rachel rinsed the product out, she said she had to put on a toner. When I told her I was frustrated by this because it was specifically what I did not want, she brought Alicia over to talk to me. I was surprised when she told me it was my fault; that I should never say what I don't want. It felt like she was angry with me. I felt very uncomfortable and just wanted to leave. Rachel seemed like a nice person. I would have preferred to deal just with her rather than feel belittled by Alicia. UPDATE: After Alicia's response, I thought readers should know all the messaging that went back and forth after I wrote this review. Alicia B. Owner Rachael, I'm so sorry you felt so uncomfortable and were embarrassed. However it would have been in more integrity to have written me a letter personally than post a BAD review over the internet about me and my salon. I understand and get that you were frustrated and angry. This is a real Back at YA. I got the message and will be more careful. Thank you Alicia Rachael A. I hear what you are saying Alicia. I thought Yelp was suppose to be a forum to give upfront reviews - not filtered. Maybe I'm wrong and will think twice before posting any reviews. As far as sending you a personal letter, you made me feel small and insignificant. You are fairly intimidating, but I think you know that. I did not want a second helping. This is not meant as a ""Back at Ya."" It's meant to be a ""Here was My Experience."" Alicia B. Owner Thank you for your feed back, however i'm not sure of the second helping, Your feedback on yelp is pretty damming to me over the internet and for the public to see and view. It is obvious your motive is for others to see your experience instead of letting me know, you posted it for the world to see. That is so hurtful and mean. I am so sorry that you felt uncomfortable, I hurt your feelings. Its your responsibility to handle your feelings and let the other person know what is your feelings so we could have talked about that or a letter to share your feelings. She came and got me because she said you wanted to talk to me. I only relayed what I understood and heard. I am so sorry that I ever came to handle a situation which was obviously wrong on my part. You make me sound like I am some one no can come and talk to which is not true. Again I apologize and you were right for your feelings, however it is better to talk it over than post for the world to see to be so hurtful and damming towards me. It would be integrity to remove the review and I will please ask you to do so on my salon's behalf. Again I am so sorry and never intended for you to feel so insignificant, which I didn't know. Rachael A. Alicia, I'm not sure what else to say. Yelp is for people to tell their experience. You are asking me to not tell my experience because it wasn't a perfect one. I appreciate the follow up. Best of luck in the future. Alicia B. Owner I'm not asking because it wasn't a perfect one. I'm asking because it's so daming . I would have appreciated a phone call or a letter communicating to me directly instead of the internet. Your experience was what was happened about your feelings, and she had me come to you because you were so angry and obviously very upset and came and got me. I stated "" maybe it would be better to communicate what you want instead of what you don't want."" It was a suggestion and not intended to be belittling. I simply made a suggestion and was taken the wrong way. I am again so sorry that she did not listen to you and that what I suggested seemed so belittling to you. We were both wrong for not listening more attentively and second for making a suggestion. She heard something different from you. That's why I suggested it. So if you feel this is right to tell your experience then so be it. I am very sorry. Rachael A. Thank you for the apology. It is certainly appreciated.",negative
"Not going back! Noisy, not relaxing, cramped, poor service I walk in the door and one of the receptionist's boyfriend was hanging out in the lobby with their dog!! He hung out with the dog in the lobby for a good 10 minutes. Gross! Though I showed up 15 minutes prior to my appointments I was taken back to my treatment more than 10 minutes late. Massage: My masseuse spent most of our hour together trying to figure out how to maneuver her chair (nosily) around the massage table. She also wasn't very good at tucking in the blanket around one part of my body while massaging the other. (It shouldn't have been that hard I am a very petite person- I wasn't taking up much of the blanket to begin with.) Noise- The walls of the massage room wall were so thin I had to listen to a really loud customer talk during my entire massage. I could hear every sound in the salon during my massage. Doors slamming, people talking, hairdryers, etc. Facial: The facial was in the same room as the massage the noise factor was still applicable. She removed my blackheads but almost to the point of hurting me. You're not supposed to pop zits. You'd think an esthetician would know this- it causes scarring. Haircut: Nothing special. My stylist gave me the same haircut that every other stylist does though I explained to her I wanted something very different. Overall: Would not go back or refer anyone to Bravo. I wasted time and money at Bravo.",negative
"I've been bringing my Toyota Corolla here for maintenance for a few years now after getting repeatedly ripped off by another auto place in town. I trust these guys implicitly. My entire family has come to them for second opinions on work other auto places have told us we ""need"" done - and these guys honestly tell us if we need it, despite having the opportunity to make a buck. Most of the time we don't actually need the work done on our cars, and even if we do, the guys at BAM give us a much fairer price. As a young woman who doesn't know the first thing about cars, I trust these guys implicitly and would recommend them to ANYONE needing a reliable mechanic. They're honest, fair, friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely be buying my next car here, but with the quality of work they've done on my 2009 car, I expect to be driving it for 5 more years at LEAST! Two thumbs up.",positive
"I bought a certified prepared Town & Country in Nov. Thought after a few days better to check the air conditioning. It didn't work, called Brunswick Auto Mall, Service Manager told me ""It worked Oct 1st"", no appointment offered to fix. Called back in and asked for manager. He was extremely rude and no appointment offeted. Called again and asked if owner and receptionist told me I was crazy and hung up on me. I called Chrysler and they took over and had me go to another dealer who replaced the faulty sensor. If I had waited it wouldn't have been covered the next Spring. They take your money then good luck. This is my 8th Chrysler mini van and I buy from good people who care. The salesman was worthless. I won't be back.",negative
"Finally under an hr for my oil change and tire rotation with an appointment! Much better then the usual 2 hr plus wait. Problem is I have to come here for my warranty, so happy they got it done at normal timely manner and on a Monday! Much better than usual maybe they are getting the service department together, fingers crossed",positive
"I had a really awful experience here. Very unprofessional personal and horrible service.I took the car in for regular maintenance and ended up waiting more then 2.5 hrs. After finally going over to ask someone if the car was ready, I found out that it was ready about an hour earlier. Nobody bother to let me know. I went to Metro Toyota to buy the car and I will go there for maintenance too!",negative
"I purchased my car from them in 2010 and religiously brought my car there for all service...nowhere else! A week ago today, I had a horrible experience with my repair advisor.

"Bought my 2012 VW Passat here in 2015. Did all of my negotiating on the car and my trade online with Norman Hoelk. He was great to work with, was knowledgeable about the car and the process. More recently, I returned to have VW service the car and I was thoroughly impressed with Lynn and Jeff. They replaced brakes, tires, and did an alignment. The price was lower than expected and the car rides (and stops!) like brand new. I'm not easy to please, so the fact that they get a five-star review from me is impressive.",positive
"This review went from a 5 star review to a 2.. I had a great experience working with Chris Podracky over at Volkswagen. Answered all my questions.. Offered me a great deal on a 2016 Jetta, But I was interested in checking out a Chrysler 200 before I made a decision.. He took me over to Chrysler and started going over my lease options for the Chrysler 200. After finding the car I wanted.. He spoke with the manager and came back with deals WAYYY better than the Jetta (2500 trade in assist). They did not have the color I wanted in the specific trim, So they offered me the comfort package for NO COST.. Actually got the price down a little bit as well.. GREAT EXPERIENCE! ..A few days later.. My fianc√© wants to trade in her lease early.. After doing some online research, I found that the jeeps had the best incentives for making up for the negative equity.. The salesman.. Which I forget his name, said.. There is no way we can help you out.. wouldn't even show us a jeep or go over numbers.. Sent us over to Volkswagen to look at a Jetta that was more money than my 200.. So we arrive at Volkswagen at 5:50.. Had no clue they closed at 6:00. We were greeted by an older gentleman. We asked for a car appraisal, He laughed and said they close at 6.. Okay no problem. We would rather work with Chris anyways. After getting in our car, We see the salesman lock the door and turn around and do a kicking motion, Which he did a few other times. Needless to say we never went back. Saturday, My fianc√© and I had an appointment to get her CX-5 fixed. Broken CD player and the power seats wouldn't work. We had a few hours to waste so we decided to talk with Brunswick Mazda. We had the pleasure of working with Joel Cruz, who had us test drive a few different cars to make sure we found the perfect car. We were set on the Mazda 6 Touring.. Which is not cheaper than the jeeps.. Didn't have as many incentives as the jeeps.. Joel and his sales manager put together some GREAT deals and we left with a 2016 Mazda 6 Touring. If anyone is considering buying/leasing a car with Brunswick automart. Ask for Joel Cruz at Mazda or Chris Podracky at Volkswagen",negative
"Excellent car buying experience here! Dave Miller was recommended to me by a family friend and I am so thankful I took the advice and went to see him! He made the purchase of my 2016 Jeep Cherokee completely painless! There was no haggling over cost, just solid assistance, quick finance time, and new car happiness! He even took the time to set up my U- connect Bluetooth system so my new Jeep was completely ready to go. I will be recommending Brunswick Auto Mart to all of my family and my friends... and will be a loyal customer for the rest of my car buying days!",positive
Salesperson Victor Santana on the Chrysler/Jeep side helped us find the perfect car for us. We were worried about gas mileage on jeeps. He ended up finding us the perfect suv for us! It was a Toyota Rav4! He was very professional and showed us as many options as we wanted! Excellent sales person and such a respectful gentleman! The whole experience was stress free as possible and enjoyable! We will be back and have already had some people asking where we went!!!,positive
"My salesman was Nick and he was great. He was very straight forward and honest throughout the entire buying experience. When I came to pick up my new Subaru, he showed me all I needed to know and went over the details of the car. The finance portion of this went very smooth and didn't take a crazy amount of time. Overall, my experience at this location was awesome and I would recommend getting a car here.",positive
"Negotiated a few hours and got $8900 off sticker. That part got 3 stars. I despise games. Get up a walk out the negotiation game and watch the price fall. My $40k truck has a occasional to constant knocking sound that drives me absolutely nuts. It's a driveshaft or axle but the service dept, well, they won't say. I've taken the truck back 3 times and was told,"" we don't know what it is, bring it back when it breaks or makes a louder noise."" The service dept get negative 5 stars. I have to turn up the volume on the radio to drown out the knock. Ridiculous!!! Zero customer service. No car wash, no little extras to say tell your friends and family to buy here next time. You can get a pretty good deal there with the right attitude of, ""I like the new car but I don't have to buy it here."" But don't forget, you're then on your own if something goes wrong with your new expensive vehicle because again, the service dept is asleep at the wheel. After 7 months of knocking Brunswick finally repaired my truck. A new rear axle....",negative
"Deceptive sales practices, and absolutely no integrity. If you buy/lease from this dealership, ensure you go through the paperwork with a fine tooth comb, or have it reviewed by an attorney. We were repeat customers and trusted them too much. Our ""lease buy out"" was actually written as an early lease turn in and we got burned to the tune of $1,088, 2 months after the deal was completed. When we received the bill from VW Credit, we called the dealership many times and no one would return our calls. We had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to get a response. We're now talking to VW Corporate, and attorneys to get the issue resolved. Save the time and hassle. Go somewhere else.",negative
"I had a really awful experience here this morning. I went in hoping to look at a 2012 Forrester that was listed on cars.com. First, they could not find the car on the lot. I brought the listing up on my phone so the sales man could look it up by number. His computer was not booting up so he couldn't use it. We found the car and he went to look for the key. I'm not sure what their system is for keys but it isn't working. He brought out a wire loop with 50+ keys on it from all different make vehicles. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why these keys were together. He had took look through the keys one by one to try and find the right key. He didn't find it and went back for another tangle of keys. Next they tell me that the price for the vehicle listed online was a ""misprint"" and that it would cost about $3,500 more (I didn't write down the prices they quoted me so this is not an exact number). I say thanks for your time but I am no longer interested and start to leave. They call me back and tell me they can knock off about a thousand dollars. Still not interested, so they insist on showing me a 2010 outback that is closer to the listed price of the 2012 Forrester. He starts to look for the outback key in yet another bundle of unorganized keys. I eventually tell him he can stop looking, I'm not interested in an outback, and I'm not happy about the false advertising. Later on my husband called to inquire about the same vehicle. He said they were very rude and told him the same thing about the misprinted price. The listing has still not been changed on cars.com, I'm curious to see if it is ever ""fixed"" or if they are using it to bring customers into the shop and then either try to sell them another vehicle at the same price or charge them more than the listing for the Forrester. It makes me wonder what other important information could be ""misprinted"".",negative
"Brunswick VW: Arrived to test drive a Passat and ended up buying one. Was offered a deal I could not refuse. Salesman Christian and staff were friendly and excellent - no pressure, just by the numbers. Took us across the street for a Camry test drive when asked. Christian provided an excellent tutorial of the new Passat. The show room is clean and open. What more can I say. JPM",positive
"I was looking for a replacement for my 2007 Forester & headed up to Brunswick due to a friend's recommendation. Bill Walls, our sales associate, was fantastic. He answered all my questions and gave some very helpful advise without being the pushy overbearing car salesman that is so common. I ended up with a 2015 Subaru Outback & love it! Bill made sure that when we picked the car up that we had a very informative ""tutorial"". Would definitely recommend Brunswick Subaru.",positive
"Hands down the most awesome car purchasing / leasing experience to date. Rick Cortes sales associate at Subaru was professional and laid back. No pressure. Subaru's pretty much sell themselves in NE Ohio with our brutal winters, and I did tons of research before I came in,still I viewed sales associates taking the time to explain the safety features and comparing the models. Within 30 minutes, I signed on the dotted line. The rest of my experience at Brunswick Auto Mart was just as friendly and top notch in customer service. I left the lot 2.5 hrs later a happy woman driving the car of my dreams. I was so thrilled with my treatment at Subaru,I told all my friends. And one of them purchased a car yesterday. #anotherhappycustomer #Subi4life #BrunswickAutoMartRocks",positive

"Your VoiceMail System is extremely aggravating; when I finally reach a real person, she quickly transfers the call despite protestations ! When I finally did get my point across, I reached Jeff Harry; A Super employee who is a real asset; He's so good I gave a five star rating despite you Phone answering system ! My 2010 Prius IV needed ne front wheel bearings; I was over the mileage but had just come back from a trip which I explained to Jeff. His suggestion that I call TFS and explain the situation saved me over $1,200.00 dollars. He then took care of having the repairs completed promptly.

"Every time I come here I have a bad experience. Today was the worst of the worst. Dean, the used car sales manager was so rude to me and talked to me like I was stupid. He didn't want to make good on a promise Jacob made! They do not treat their customers with respect nor do they want to help customers. They just want to cover their own butts. Only good thing about this visit was the service guy Steve. He was really trying to help me out. I will never buy another car here again and am going to go on all my social media accounts to tell everyone my experience, especially with Dean. I'd give this review no stars if that were possible. I guess the 1 star can go to Steve who deserves to work for a better company than this. He was a great guy! To anyone looking to buy a car go to Jay dealerships in Bedford! They are always so awesome and helpful and I wish I never decided to take my business elsewhere.",negative
"You will like this establishment if you prefer to deal with rude, disrespectful, non caring individuals. All else please do yourself a favor and go to another dealer..... Within 5 minutes of visiting the dealer the sales rep who was more concerned with making a sale than worrying about the safety of my children backed into my son knocking him to the ground and slamming his head on the concrete luckily he did not step on him as well. Should have just walked away with that start but we continued on. Was looking feverishly for a very specific car when all we wanted to do was drive a car did not care about options or colors at that point and there were 12 in front of us. So after 5 minutes I suggested we drive one of the ones sitting up front.... He pulled the car out and drove it approx 100 feet from our van (kids need car seats!) so I suggested he pull it next to the van so we can get our seats.... Luckily he was too busy to help us after the test drive and we were passed on to a very kind and professional rep - perhaps the only one in the dealership from our observation. Made a deal and bough the car. Should have driven the actual car we purchased before signing papers since the car had an immediate vibration at highway speeds so back to the dealer a day later. Now on to service. I cannot stress this enough NEVER NEVER NEVER Take your car to their service department. They are completely disorganized they say they are going to do things and do not they tell you they spoke to people regarding an issue and did not etc etc etc. Had to call 20 times to get an actual answer from a living person as to the status of my ""repair"" on my brand new car. They told me they had no idea what is wrong? Apparently they are not trained mechanics? How can you not know what is wrong with a new car so it sat overnight. Next day I make 10 more calls at 11 am I finally speak to a manager and he knew nothing about the car??? That was not what I was told last evening... I expressed my outrage and disgust with how this situation was being handled and asked that they make this a priority since I just paid a handsome amount of money for a car that I physically do not have in my possession. Needless to say when they are done I will not be stepping back there for anything other than my plates. I wish I could tell them to keep the car give me my money back and I would move on but I guarantee that this is the type of dealer that does not care about consumers rights or what happens after the sale. BUYER BE WARNED! Please note I am NOT Slamming the product but the service and the way they do business. Cars are complex machines and things will go wrong. I wish I had bought a new luxury car the treatment those dealerships offer is second to none.",negative
"This is all around an absolutely terrible dealer. I have no idea why Chrysler hasn't pulled their franchise from them. This is only scratching the surface of my problems here. First, the service department is an absolute joke, and getting a hold of them over the phone is next to impossible because no one ever answers the phone. I brought my 2010 Jeep Patriot to have a front end alignment done. I get the car back and there was a terrible popping noise coming from the front when accelerating. I took it back and they said it was the struts... Nope! THEY FORGOT TO TIGHTEN THE LUG NUTS AFTER THE ALIGNMENT! I contacted Chrysler and they didn't seemed to be concerned by this at all. Then I made them check the alignment because you can't align a car with loose wheels, they said they would not perform a front alignment because the tie rods were bad... When they did the first alignment they did a multi-point inspection and the tie rods were totally fine (I doubt they even checked the tie rods... Or anything for that matter). They have absolutely no problem taking my money for aligning a car with bad tie rods but when it's on their dime, its all of a sudden not okay..... Needless to say I got my money back. They have also crushed my rocker panels on my brand new 2013 Dodge Dart, I made them fix it. AND! apparently they do not test drive their cars after they perform repairs. They installed a new steering gear on the Dart and I got in the car and it was making a terrible noise. They service tech said to me they did not test drive my car after performing this major repair... The sales department is no better. My sales person was excellent but the Manager, Chris Folta is extremely rude and knows nothing about cars. Due to his lack of knowledge on the Darts, he messed up my special ordered car and didn't know a certain feature wasn't available on my trim level. He also said to me and my mom out loud and in front of customers: ""IF YOU DON'T TRUST US THEN WHY DID YOU BUY A CAR FROM US!?"" That is not customer service. This is all around a terrible dealer. They are too big and they treat you like a number. I now go to Falls Motor City for all my car needs because they are excellent and very knowledgeable.",negative
"Extremely disorganized used car sales area. There is no room to look at the cars, and they actually have another lot to keep the used cars at. I went there twice, and the first time the car ""sold"" right before i got there. The salesman that I worked with did go above and beyond to make it right. I did come back and purcahse another car. He showed me all of the service records and all of the work they did to the car. no sooner did I drive it off the lot, it had an issue. So, i went back and its in the shop again. They did give me a loaner to drive. Not a great experience, but not a horrible one either....",negative
"This is single-handely...the worst business that I have ever been to in my entire life so far. I wouldn't even dare to give this a star...this should be no stars at all. However, tie for the review... I came in here looking for a Toyota Avalon...but when I arrived at the dealership, I recieved no greeting from a salesman, no help when I asked for it, and it pissed me off to see that these workers were in thier own world drinking and eating without a care for the customers who were in the same situation I was in. Forgetting the crap service, I went back ouside and found the car I was looking for, so I went to go find someone to help me out with the Avalon just so I could hear it's specifications, performance and total cost. I couldn't find a single employee to help me out and one of them who would acknoweldge me responded with a lazy...""that isn't my job"" answer. What do you mean it isn't your job?? This is an auto dealership for Penelope's Sake!! Angry and about to sock the guy on his knees, I left the dealership and still have never returned. I would love to see this place get a whole new staff and management department. This is not how to treat a customer...and sorry to say, this is the worst then Wal-Mart.",negative
"In 1996 I had pretty much the exact same experience that Chelsea M had in 2013, but add 3 tired hungry toddlers. I knew EXACTLY what (Plymouth) vehicle and what color I wanted, but this dealership didn't have it, so they made us drive higher models and stalled us for HOURS until after close on a Saturday. We found our perfect car at another dealership on Sunday. In telling Brunswick Auto Mart to stop 'the hunt', their gm actually said to my husband, ""What kind of MAN goes back on his word?"" (re: our promise to buy the car we wanted) Then further said to me, ""Where do you think you're going to get service?"" To which I replied, ""What? You mean I can't bring my van here?"" I swore I'd never go back. The personal insults and intimidation were unreasonable and uncalled for. Fast forward 17 years... after moving all over the Midwest I end up back in the area. Now I have a Toyota, and the web tells me my nearest dealer is in Brunswick. Oops... turns out it's THAT dealership. I paid about $60 for an oil change & tire rotation, turned down all the recommended fixes (one reasonable, two unnecessary) and bought air filters on my way home that I installed myself. When I got home I found my tire pressure light on and measured them myself at 28, 30,30, and 32. (35 recommended) I went back - they turned off the warning light and insinuated that old tire gauges are inaccurate and actually told me if I didn't take the highway, the tires (now supposedly measuring 35, although he didn't SHOW me) aren't hot. Right. I'll stop & fill the air myself. Apologies to all the good dealerships, but... I will avoid ALL dealerships in the city of Brunswick because I don't want to 'accidentally' wind up at Brunswick Auto Mart ever again.",negative
"These guys are absolutely terrible. My cousin has actually had his car damaged multiple times by these guys, it's like they don't know what they're doing 90% of the time. When I went I wanted to check out a Toyota Celica they had on the lot. The guy first asked where I worked (by the way, don't tell them you're an engineer) and if you're making a lot of money they'll try getting you to buy more expensive vehicles. Then they'll make assumptions that ""well you're a kid, and kids love turbo engines"". That and the guy said ""hey, here's a Pontiac selling for $40,000, it's nearly the same as the Toyota and you'll have a turbo engine!"". Those guys make me gag.

""WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BOOK YOUR RESERVATION FOR YOU?"" Ummm.. how in the hell do you expect me to get from Gateway to Sky Harbor... by pack mule??! How could a national car rental place not have a location near noth airports??! DUMB.. REALLY STUPID.",negative
"We goofed and showed up 20 minutes late, 2:20, for our 2pm reservation on NYE. Website stated they were open until 3; sign on door - which we had no way of seeing- stated 2pm. Sam was just locking the door as we walked up. He reopened the door and completed our transaction instead of leaving us without a car for a holiday road trip. He had a family member waiting for him and some place to be, but still helped us.",positive
"I'm traveling internationally and needed help from a local agent in Chandler. I called several times and the agent (Tim, if I'm not mistaken) was an ass. Couldn't be bothered to hear me out and find a solution. Kept trying to send me to another store - get rid of me. Not the AVIS that I am used to. No customer service skills. ""Help me find a solution. Don't become another problem.""",negative
"Great property! Full kitchen, comfy beds and bedrooms if you need space. There was plenty of parking, gazebos, close to the mall, Wal-Mart and lots of restaurants. We had a one bedroom suite that had a bed in the living room area instead of the sofa couch that is typical. Spacious bathroom and plenty of supplies in the kitchen. I will certainly stay here again. The staff is friendly and the price is right.",positive
"I have been staying here almost a week now and have found a gem. When I arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful and fast, even taking me on a tour and explaining where things were located. The hallways were misleading as they are drab and you can smell people's food, but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to my room. Everything was clean and fresh and roomy, very comfortable and well laid out. The bed is super comfortable and it has been really quiet for my entire stay and it has been pretty full the entire time. I have to admit I wasn't expecting much as it was very reasonable, but I will definitely stay at this place again!",positive
"Pet friendly and comfortable beds! That's what I needed. And I mean pet friendly! Only a $15 fee for having my dog here. My dog is allowed anywhere in the hotel and outside, as long as I clean up after him. Very friendly staff and friendly guests too. Maybe the rooms have been upgraded recently, because I am not sure about the negative reviews. We had a very modern looking queen suite with a spacious bathroom and kitchenette. The fridge was full size, no oven, but the cook top was a glass top. Very clean, comfortable beds (very comfy beds!!!), air conditioning worked great, and free coffee and water. THEY DO NOT DO BREAKFAST in the morning. But, no problem. There are many choices for truly economical breakfast restaurants very close. Or, just get some eggs, etc and prep in your room with the nice kitchenette!",positive
"Was in the area for dog Agility. Stayed for 6 nights in a 1-bedroom Queen suite with sofa bed. The room was spotless when we arrived; loved having a full fridge, dishwasher, and mini-stove. Convenient location near freeway, shopping, and restaurants. Very dog-friendly facility.",positive
I am so amazed by this hotel it was very clean when we arrived the hotel staff is very helpful and nice will definitely stay here again,positive
this hotel is so bad they do not clean your room for 7day asked front desk to clean told thats policy. no one should not stay in this hotel.,negative
"Recently upgraded, non smoking hotel. We stayed last year for the first time. The room was a little small, but upgraded and it had everything we needed. The bed was comfy too and Love the fully furnished kitchen and nice desk area. No pool or breakfast. Coffee meh but service friendly. The workout and laundry room are side by side and a little small.",positive
"A friend and I were trying to coordinate rooms. His family bought a room at the regular rate, but then when I tried to buy a room, they said we had to pay for two extra nights. It was either the two extra nights we didn't need, or no room, even though they had rooms available. There are no words to describe such shady business practices. I would never stay with Candlewood again. Ever.",negative
I am a IHG platinum member. With that said I reserved a 1king bed room. With platinum status you get free upgrades when available. Apparently it was available and they upgraded us to a king suite. When we opened the door of the room it was apparent that someone had smoked in our nonsmoking room. It was bad really bad. My fianc√© and I are non smokers. Also the room was a handicap room which being non handicap makes me feel awkward. So we asked for another room but she said that would not be possible because they were sold out. She did offer us some spray and we tried to open the windows but nothing was helping. We decided to take our business else where. With all that said front desk was very friendly and helpful.,negative
"Very poor. Would expect this to be appropriate for a business stay, but no. Business center is one computer, the printer ran out of paper. We told front desk, but they didn't immediately respond. Children of the breakfast servers were present, helped themselves to the buffet, loudly shoving and fighting. We watched one of them prepare his coffee. It was evident that this was common occurrence for them. The tv in the breakfast room is set on cartoons, on a weekday morning. Hot tub broken. Car at the back entrance had motor running for over an hour at approx 10 a.m. check out. (Older Towncar). The airport shuttle looked ok. We had a car, however. Overall, poor management. Go anywhere else.",negative
"My stay was awful. The hotel was full of children running all over the place.In the elevators, in the hallways, in the staircase, in the weight room.. There was water all over the floor all day from the kids running from the pool. This went on all day and night. We could not eat any breakfast because the kids were all over it. I have never stayed at a hotel where they are charging your card before you even leave and when you inquire the front desk knows nothing. Never again!",negative
"Found the Hotel on Hotel.com, we decided to go to Concord Mills Mall stay the night and then do something the next day. We checked in and everything seemed fine at first. We went to our room and hit the pool. It is on the smaller side but it's the right size for the kids and us. The water was beyond cold, didn't stop us. We noticed the tile work was really needing some attention and saw a lot of rust spots around the pool and equipment. The pool towels were also very low, just enough for us at least. My wife and I hit the hot tub and found sand all along the bottom of it. Never have I seen such a thing in an indoor pool. Like someone played beach volleyball and it the hot tub. We got out of the pool and headed to our room. One positive was the AC we were able to make the room nice and cool. Go to out the kids in the shower and the tub plug was down, thank goodness the water was brown. I let it run for several minutes and it finally cleared up. I was upset we booked the room for 4 people and only had three towels. We find a place to eat on Yelp and headed out. I stopped by the desk and said something about the water and the lady said they had water issues recently, and you just needed to let it run. Would been nice to know during check in. Came back from dinner and decided to call it an early night 9. Get the kids down and next thing you know BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. Kids running up and down the halls. We couldn't see any on our floor it was coming from up stairs. It went on until around 11. Never heard so much noise in a hotel. You can hear the folks talking next door and at 3 am the drunks in the parking lot. Next morning we got up and headed to breakfast. I wasn't aware scrambled eggs came in a soup format but there they were. Even my wife who likes scrambled eggs on the soft side said they were way to watery. They had bacon, ham, potatoes, waffles, and your normal cereal and such. I told the lady during check out about the noise and she said that she was aware of a large group of kids and didn't think they had enough adults for them all. I told her I was very disappointed with my stay.",negative
"It's ok on the clean scale etc. But the walls are too thin and the floor creaks above you. I called to the front desk because the next door occupant was way too noisy with their music, no help. They did not call or visit. So the music played on. Thanks for nothing.",negative
I recently stayed here for work and found the hotel very nice and clean. And the shower was so ROOMY. The bed had some funny square pillows but I travel with my own. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. There are tons of place to eat around the area. And easy on and off to the highway.,positive
"I've stayed here multiple times on business and overall it is the the best place in the area for your dollar. The rooms are attractive and nicely furnished with refrigerators, microwaves, adequate outlets, hairdryer, etc. There is a pool and a little hot tub area and the fitness room has the basics. The complementary breakfast is pretty good, although you won't find any vegan protein (not even peanut butter) but I always plan ahead when I visit. The only negative is that the walls seem thin. I could hear neighbors on either side of me. But again, it is still my hotel of choice when I'm in this area.",positive
"Welcome to a clean Motel 6! Beds are low to ground and flat w/ four under sized pillows. Pool small, cloudy & uninviting! Friendly quick service, below Quality Inn & Country Suites: owned by same corporation. Noisy with thin walls and corridor! Great rate @ 75$ including taxes, so you can't beat it for an over night stay with early travel plan. Would not stay here again due to beds, bedding and facility! I'm not sure how this hotel received high star review! I'm being nice giving them a two: only for the cleanliness!",negative
"Clean, comfortable beds, wonderful interstate access to and from this location. Many good restaurant options less than a quarter of a mile away. Cracker Barrel, Hardee's, Mexican food, Bojangles, Italian food, and of course 7-Eleven. A large chain Gas Station is also close to the hotel. The rooms are spacious, the beds are comfortable and inviting. The linens are marvelous. Great customer service. You will enjoy your stay. Made to order Waffles included in the contential breakfadt. Nice cook..",positive
"My husband normally does the researching of the Motels when we go out of town and as he did for this trip he checked with Travelosity on line and checked what reviewers thought of this place and it got pretty high reviews, so we chose to try it out. We got in on a Friday evening, The front desk help was quick and efficient. It looked as if 2/3 of the motel parking spaces were taken so we knew it would have some noise issues. As we walked through we noted they had a good choice of equipment in the work out room. There was a pool and Jacuzzi indoors as well. We took the elevator to our room, and when we opened the door the first thing that greeted us was the smell of new carpet. It looked very modern and well furnished. Deep mahogany colored large desk, Flat screen TV with a cabinet that hid a mini fridge and Microwave. The bathroom was very nice as well.Raised counters,large tub and all new fixtures. It was a very clean room. We continued to be surprised by the cleanliness of it all. It was so refreshing. The only complaint I have are the walls are thin! I heard a baby crying at least 3 hours in the middle of the night with 2 angry parents not able to sooth the child. We will return to this hotel if we are in the Concord area again. Other notes: Weekend breakfast goes till 10:30. Although its nothing to write home about. Stick to juice and a bagel. Skip the powdered eggs. Also, through Travelosity we got a room with 2 beds for $77.01",positive
"We would give lower rating but can't. First the park is in a risky neighborhood. We did not know it but we woke up in the moring to police and police helicopter going around and around over the rv park. The police kept saying ""Do not try to run, you are surrounded, put your hands up."" Now this was at 6 am in the morning on a Sunday! Another thing is that there is a population of people that live in their campers there and do not follow the rules for ALL animals to be on a leash. I have two small dachshunds and a cat was under our camper that we did not know about. It was another campers pet. My dogs do not like cats and my dogs were on leases but when my little one saw the cat....he went after it. The other camper on the other side of us also had a cat off leash. She proceeded to yell at me about my dogs. My husband took our dogs out to potty at 9pm to see a woman with two medium size dogs that were off leash. My dog was on lease and by my camper she was waking around with a flashlight when HER dogs went after my dog which my husband had to pick up to save him from being attacked. This woman works part time at the park and DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RULES. I hated this place the minute I saw it and it is run down, not a good RV place.",negative
This RV Park was horrible! We got to this park at dusk but could tell it was a run down place. We do a lot of RVing but had never been to Arizona and found this spot on the web. My husband took our dog out of the park and was approached by some low life guys that he feared for his life with. The man next to our spot was racist and mean. This park was one of the most expensive parks we've ever stayed in and was the worst one we've ever stayed in. This place is bad inside and outside and we will never go anywhere near it again. The only thing decent about this place is the manager Angie. I wish she had been rude so that we had never gone there.,negative
My son's bike was stolen right next to our trailer. Everyone parked their bikes next to their rv so we thought it would be fine. There is NO gate separating this place from the street heading towards the freeway(which you can hear traffic all night long) and there was an entire wall broken down connecting the very run down apartment complex to this place. Key for vandalism. Showers were nice but the price for this place was NOT worth it.,negative
"Great park! Angy the manager was the most helpful and kind in our time of need...Above and beyond. Wonderful sites, trees, clean accessible showers and restrooms. Easy access to highways and shopping. We are going to stay here every chance we get to be in Arizona! Really nice people parked all around us. Don't miss this spot.",positive
"A grassy oasis in the desert! This is a wonderful park with friendly, accommodating staff and a cool pool. They even have a vending machine with cold candy bars! Every site has a bit of grass, and most have at least a little shade. It is in a latino neighborhood, so racist people might feel uncomfortable.",positive
"VERY expensive for what it is, because it isn't much. When we first drove in to the campground my immediate impression was of a tired, worn out property. Our site was an extremely small area next to the office with a number of sheds behind us. The water, electric and sewer were fine however, our internet did not work at all. We were told there were computer problems that day and they'd reset it. After about 30 minutes my husband called Angie again to say the internet still wasn't working. He got her voicemail and left a message, she never returned his call. Luckily we only committed to one night, I couldn't wait to get out of there.",negative
Let me start by saying that i'm new to the RV lifestyle. With that said my gal and I moved down here to pheniox looking go start fresh and a new adventure. We had made plans to stay at another park but that feel through. So we where given angye' s number and gave her a call. She was very polite and helpful with all the questions we had. She keeps the place up and clean and she is always trying to make improvements. The spaces are a good size and the water and sewer all work good. The pool is blue and the water clean and inviting. She has newly remodeled restrooms and showers and they are clean and fresh. The park also offers laundry room and pop and candy machines. The place is very relaxing and just fun to be here. Where here on a long stay but the overnight and short short stay u won't be disappointed. The park also has fruit trees andvit is yummy and delicious. So we will leave the camp fire on for u so stop on in and say hey.,positive
"Had to go to Phoenix for doctor appointments and got to Phoenix kind of late and saw this RV park was close by on my smartphone. The manager, Angie, was able to give me an overflow site and even helped me back up into it with my travel trailer. They were very busy but she was able to let me stay there for two weeks while I took care of my medical care. The park is rather small but very cozy and comfortable. There are lots of trees and lawn. There are a number of long terms people staying there apparently and I had the chance to visit with a number of them. There were very friendly and funny and dog friendly folks. The park has a fantastic location, being just off the freeway but also close to a huge dog park, good shopping and restaurants. Cement walls all around helped keep the noise level very comfortable. The Wi-Fi was better than many places I have visited. And last but not least, the bathrooms and laundry were very nice. When I come back to Phoenix, I will stay there if possible.",positive
"Cozy little RV Park. Saw lots of not so great reviews and was concerned but my family had an okay experience here. I think maybe some people just have higher expectations than others? I mean its not the ritz, its an RV park....Anyone renting a space is usually there for the experience more than anything...I would come here again.",positive
"If you like homeless people, if you like police helicopters, if you like dog poo, if you like watching drug deals going on at the entrance late at night, if you like chaining everything down to keep from being stolen, if you like loud stereos (cars), being woke up by loud motor cycles, there are 2 apartment buildings close to the park most trouble comes from the low income apartments. people are free to come and go as they please(homeless) the owners and management could care less! most pet owners are responsible and pic up after there pet right then. And others are irresponsible let there dogs doo every where and leave it for the flies. make sure you bring plenty of locks with you! you will need them. your better off spending the extra money and stay at a secured rv park!",negative
"We have been staying for multiple nights in the springtime for three years now. The Covered Wagon looks better than it ever has. It is retro. It is small. It is what we like. There are several long term occupants. Yea! Boo! Yea, they know the area and are helpful. They are not the nosey Good Sam types who give unsolicited advice. Boo! It means there is not always a selection of spots to choose from. This place is very well located for our needs in Phoenix. The neighborhood is safer today than it was three years ago. Be street wise. Carry a large dog on the end of a leash. Angie manages the place and is very pleasant and acommodating. She may have a hard time saying no to RV'rs without reservations. She does a great job on keeping the place clean. My wish. I wish the owner would purchase adjoining lots and expand/ remodel the whole park. Build a new multipurpose building with showers and laundry and Tiki Bar next to the pool. This could also act as a managers home/office. Add spaces in the same direction to each row headed north. Put a wall up on the north end. I would pay $10.00 a day more for a new and improved Covered Wagon RV Park. Although I love the landscaping, the reality is that water thirsty plants, lawns are on their way out. Replace with stamped concrete and astro- turf. We will come back.",positive
"Convenient location and EZ access to Black Mountain Freeway offset the startling lack of amenities and indifferent staffing. A hostile check-in process starts things off: If you're lucky, the owner (of the horsey set who lives in the foothills an hour north) will be in the office; if not, you'll have to get lucky dialing one of the several phone numbers posted near the door. DO NOT (even with a confirmed reservation) randomly choose any of the many available sites and plan to check in in the morning, You will be asked to relocate when staff (belatedly) arrives on scene. There is a small pool (unheated), adjacent to the bathhouse, a depression-era affair best used only for the laundry machines. The good news is lots of grass. There are shady sites under the large trees or wide-open sites for the satellite dish crowd. There is electric, sewer, and water, but no phone or cable. In spite of the soundwall, there is some road noise, plus police helicopters frequent the skies above. The immediate neighborhood is dumpy and sketchy-looking but without any real crime problem. About 1/3 of the sites are occupied by permanent residents. We have stayed here several times and will again when we travel to Phoenix.",negative
"I just got verbally assaulted over the phone from James Staddon. He called me screaming at me because I had asked him why I was given a loaner vehicle with the gas light on? If he was trying to accommodate for the already run around I have already gotten why would he fail by giving a loaner vehicle with no gas? I was appalled by this. I had initially placed a call in to him after I have been given the run around for 4 months on my new vehicle purchase. I need work done that would be covered under warranty, and because they weren't making any money off me they gave me the run around. I recommend that no one go to this dealership as they harrass women and when a woman turns them down, they decide to be completely and utterly rude. Its disgusting, when you go in to get a vehicle and come out being harrassed by the men in higher positions there. Avoid talking to Jesse the sales manager as he is married and tries to date all the clients there. Its disgusting. I will never purchase or go near that dealership ever again. I have a voice and will not tolerate being harassed because I am a woman.",negative
"This is my first time oil change here and take so long, when done came home n see oil change warning signal still popping wonder planing to going back again..no star for this time .. I don't feel ... all the dodge service is not good enough..",negative
"It's so disappointing that we live so close to the absolute worst Mopar Dealership on the planet, Crowfoot Dodge. I made the mistake of getting my vehicle serviced there for a period until they did major damage to the oil adaptor on my wife's van on a simple oil change. Every time I got service on my truck I asked to have it washed and they agreed to do but it never happened on any occasion. Over the period we used them for service we got both calls and and post mail (addressed like letters) to the house. I've asked repeatedly to be taken off the mailing list both over the phone and in person. Each time I've been assured this has been done and to this day, including today I get both mail and phone calls. We haven't used them for anything since the incident with my wife's van in December. We have never bought a vehicle from them (we bought the van through Cochrane Dodge and the truck through Olds Dodge). Their service dept has no working experience on any of the vehicles they provide parts for. If you can't give them a part number they don't have a clue - and that's in this day and age where there are the least amount of models in dodge's line. I do not recommend doing any business with this place.",negative
Traded in 2011 diesel 3/4 ton for a downsized truck for family. 2015 5.7 Hemi Ram SXT. No need for all the extras. Love the truck. Wife likes to drive it because it is not as big as diesel. Don and Dale in finance were so awesome to deal with. Like visiting an old friend. And sales Guy Ray LaGace was such a good old east coast boy and was a delight to deal with. 3 brand new vehicles since 2005 from this dealer. Love this place. Very helpful and accommodating. Right down to offering me one of their personal vehicles to run around while I waited for paper work. I recommend this dealer to anyone in Calgary and out of town.,positive
"The dealership, and in particular the service department, is awful. Staff take forever (i.e. weeks) to return calls or emails and when they do get back they have this weird mix of arrogance and rudeness. I'm fairly close to the Crowfoot Dodge but will never take my vehicles back.",negative
"Horrible Sales and service! Bought my jeep there, had nothing but problems, ended up going to Varsity, purchased my last one at varsity, they are awesome to deal with. Never will go back to Crowfoot Dodge!",negative
"What a fantastic buying experience this was. Full credit must go to Alex Raposo. Whilst I had my hire car for 2 weeks (just arrived from the UK) Alex was searching for a Grand Cherokee ltd for me. Nothing came up. As my hire car had to go back, they arranged to lend me an 09 caliber. Nice enough, especiall as it was completely free, even the fuel! Then I saw a Ram 1500 mega cab Laramie that I fell in love with. This was was Saturday evening. I was driving it by Monday! They even lent me their plates till I sort out my insurance. Awesome!!! I don't know if this service is standar in Canada, but it certainly isn't in the UK. They couldn't give a crap about you in the UK. Their only interest is your money. So thanks to the guys for a fantastic buying experience. I'll certainly go back for my next vehicle.",positive
"David Rodriques was phenomenal to work with. He is very knowledgable, friendly, prompt and very organized. He helped us all along the way with everything we needed for the trip and got back to us not matter how trivial the question! We had not traveled abroad and he made our journey through the necessary paperwork and documentation a breeze. Unfortunately, I took a fall and had to cancel. Even though he was traveling at the time he helped us through the cancellation process step by step and we are now ready to re-book for next year. Can't wait to work with him again. Don't forget to obtain travel insurance!!!! Thank you David!!!",positive
"In spite of being given little time to prepare, Dave did a great job in planning our trip to Asia. Dave expedited our visas to China and aided us with guides and accommodations in Beijing, Shanghai, Ho Chi Min City, and Singapore. I look forward to working with Dave on future trips.",positive
"Last March, Dave at Ride The Wave Travel helped me plan our first cruise. I didn't know anything about cruising except for hearing about friends' experiences. I really felt that a trip to Alaska warranted some professional assistance and that was certainly the right decision. We are now back from our trip and it could not have been more perfect. The ship, the itinerary, our suite class, excursions, advice on dining and beverage packages, etc...every detail was exactly right for us. Dave asked me a lot of questions when planning our trip, to get an idea of our tastes and preferences. He really listened and did an excellent job of interpreting my answers. Ultimately, two other couples joined us on the cruise and Dave made it easy to coordinate our cabin locations and travel arrangements even though all 3 couples live in different states. During the cruise we had one small hiccup with the cruise line concerning our onboard credit. I sent a text to Dave and he contacted the cruise line and got the issue ironed out quickly. And Dave himself happened to be on vacation at the time. Who could ask for better service than that?! Dave provided the expertise that gave us the adventure of a lifetime. Not that it will be our last now that we have Dave, our travel agent extraordinaire and genuinely nice person!",positive
We went on our trip at the beginning of July and I'm now ready to provide an update. We had the time of our lives and Jim along with Ride the Wave were a big part of making it happen. We had some issues with 2 tours that we booked through Ride the Wave and Jim was fast to respond and assist. One of the tours we ended up having to cancel due to scheduling issues. I reached out to Jim to let him know and he worked on getting the refund process started right away and I received a confirmation email from the tour vendor the same day. We're now just waiting for it to get credited back to our card. The peace of mind of our trip being taken care of by professionals is invaluable. I can't recommend enough going through a travel agency for big trips because you just never know what could happen. Ride the Wave is as good as they come and I'm looking forward to using their services again for our next big trip!,positive
"So far, I am more than pleased! I have not yet gone on my trip that Dave has booked for me but he has been incredibly helpful and so patient. He got me a much better deal than I could have ever gotten on my own. I will post another review after my trip, but I am incredibly happy with his service so far. He has exceeded my expectations!",positive
"Dave was our travel agent for what we considered a complex, detailed trip. We were traveling with our adult son, who would be leaving from a different state, and traveling to 3 different countries. We had various accommodations, various airlines, and our son was traveling a week earlier than us and we were returning home later than our son. There were a LOT of parts and pieces! Dave's attention to detail, patience with us, thoroughness in determining our goals and expectations, and tireless conversations making sure we were satisfied and knowledgeable about our options - were amazing! His recommendations for accommodations turned out perfect for us. His recommendations for excursions were well researched and he matched his recommendations to our own interests and budget. What a gift to us! One of the many things we appreciated was his attention to our needs and desires for travel. We will DEFINITELY call him for our next big trip, and will recommend him to others!",positive
"Dave is the man! This was my first time to Asia, and first experience using a travel agent to book a trip; I was unsure how the process worked. My trip was very complex, it was a 5 week trip I began with my Dad to Japan, Singapore and Thailand. After I met several friends in Thailand for a couple weeks, then I finished traveling by myself through Vietnam and Cambodia. Dave was extremely helpful in developing a plan that would work with all of our timelines. My itinerary went through many iterations, and had different types of speeds/activities throughout. I was able to discuss with Dave what I was looking for and the budget for the trip. He was able to use his depth of experience to come up with great ideas and locations to visit. We would discuss them, and come up with modifications if I wished. Dave made himself available morning to night for calls and returning email. He shared many other travel tips with me to help me prepare. He also checked in during my travels to see if there was anything he could do to improve or assist. He printed my full travel plan and mailed it to me so I had a hard copy, and emailed it so I had it electronically. He developed a timeline of events leading up to my trip to remind me of certain milestones (applying for visas, deposits, full payments, etc). He managed all my finances and split/itemized amounts among my Dad and friends to ensure we had everything accounted for. I would highly recommend Dave and Ride the Wave Travel for any type of travel, but especially for people traveling somewhere new and/or with little time to research their adventure.",positive
"Dave of Ride the Wave Travel went way above and beyond to creat the ideal itinerary for my new bride and I to enjoy a dream honeymoon! No easy task as it was very last minute with a few twists along the way. He was able to secure two 7-day cruises back to back, without leaving our cabin, and coordinated 14 days worth of free drinks saving us about $1,500. In addition to this our departure was delayed by a day, and Dave assisted in filing the claim to reimburse us through the travel insurance company (he strongly recommended the insurance which I usually decline!) THANKS DAVE!!!!",positive
"My husband and I decided to go to Hawaii for our anniversary. The thought of lining up air, car, hotel and activities while working in the blind overwhelmed me. As a former employee of American Express Travel and American Airlines I knew the ins and outs of getting there, air/hotel/car et al, but what about after we arrived? Consequently I decided to find a travel agent who might know about the islands. Where else to turn but Yelp? Ride the Wave Travel sounded like it would fill the bill. I left a message and in a very short time Dave returned my call. He was very nice. He asked questions and unfortunately I could only give him generalities because I didn't know enough about what was available to give him enough information. I really didn't give him much to work with. So he researched and did his best to plan a fun experience for us. He worked with me and put together a package that came in under our budget. He found a luau that was such fun! He lined up a helicopter tour that took us over lava fields and waterfalls. Then he suggested a night dive with manta rays. We never would have known about this had it not been for Dave's experience and it was a spotlight experience of my 64years. It was AWESOME. Dave sent me reminders before we left and made sure we had all the documentation. After we got to the hotel he called to check on us and assured if there were any problems with flights or accommodations he would advocate for us. He didn't need to though because everything was perfect. Epic in fact. If you want knowledge, caring service and a very nice person to plan your trip, choose Dave at Ride The Wave.",positive
My partner and I used the services of Ride The Wave Travel last May for our trip to Hawaii. Dave Rodrigues and his associate gave us exceptional service and met our every need. They responded to every e-mail we sent without delay and frequently touched base with us to see if there was anything we needed. The vacation was wonderful without a hitch. Our accommodations were the best and we would not hesitate to use Ride The Wave again and would recommend it to our friends. Richard McTevia and Alwyn Ogawa,positive
"My husband and I usually limit our travel to the US so when we planned a trip to Italy and Norway we decided to go with a professional. I searched online and Dave popped up. The only recommendation I saw for Ride the Wave was the one posted before mine but it sounded great so I gave Dave a call. From the moment I met him on the phone, I knew right away we were in good hands. Dave has an incredible attention to detail and I loved his great communication. He is available even after hours and responds quickly. There were a lot of details in coordinating rental car, several different hotel reservations, train tickets, and multiple flights but Dave did a great job. The hotels he chose were in perfect locations central to trains and also walking distance to the heart of the cities. When i was without printed rail passes, Dave contacted the hotel in Rome and send them over asap. It was such a pleasure to know Dave had everything under control and the trip turned out to be the experience of a lifetime. The only thing Dave can't take credit for is the beautiful weather we had in a country that is known for frequent rain! There was nothing that could have made our vacation better than it was and Dave had a lot to do with that. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to plan a trip. You won't be disappointed!",positive
"I recently went on my first trip outside of the US. I'd been planning on doing this for awhile, but suddenly had the travel bug bite hard and decided to make it happen. Only one small problem: my traveling buddy and I have extremely difficult schedules in our work live to coordinate a time to vacation together. We decided the only way this was going to work was for us to use a travel agency instead to coordinate all of the nitty gritty details. Enter Ride the Wave Travel. David (our agent) was extremely useful in handling the search, booking and general preparation of the entire trip. He suffered through many conference calls where we threw various date changes and reschedules his way with the best of positive attitudes. He even had to change our hotel reservation at a somewhat last minute when one of the cities we were originally going to visit fell off the trip, forcing us to extend our stay in a different city. It was so delightful not having to worry when plans changed. If something needed to be adjusted, it was met, ""all right, let's call David and let him know"". The trip was a dream come true. The hotel, selected by David, was fabulous and it was wonderful not having to worry about any of the paperwork and just enjoy myself. I am a firm believer in properly detaching oneself during vacations, and I believe that step starts with the booking process. I would definitely recommend Ride the Wave travel to anyone looking for a good travel agency. I will be using them again this year for my next trip!",positive
"Defiantly ride the wave with this guy! David was so on top of every issue and point related to my trip to Scandinavia. Even though we changed and encountered some schedule conflicts, our agent was constantly on every detail. The attention to those little details is why you bring in someone like our agent. He was there at every moment and made sure we were well taken care of from airport to hotel and back. I would recommend Ride The Wave for all trips and cruises.",positive
"Dave and his team of experts take all the guesswork and uncertainty out of planning everything from a weekend getaway to an international trip of a lifetime...your arrangements are handled efficiently, timely, and with respect to your requests and budget. Can't recommend Ride The Wave Travel enough!",positive
"Looking old and tired. But, a good price, especially considering the free breakfast. I hear that they might be shutting down in December because the mall wants the land.",negative
"No complaints here! I booked this hotel through Allegiant Air, which was a good decision. The cost was affordable, the placement was pretty key. The breakfast was unsatisfying but that's nothing to write home about. Everything felt clean, the staff was nice without being too friendly. I thought it was funny looking out my room at the mall parking lot, with a giant Macy*s sign right behind it. What an interesting and silly place!",negative
"If I could give it a minus rating I would. I was vacationing a few weeks ago in Scottsdale (my first time in the city). We wanted to come in a day early. We called Hotel.com and talked to the agent. They told us it was a remodeled hotel with a handicap room with two beds. When we go there it was not remodeled, a handicap room with 1 king size bed. It was the worst night I have stayed at any hotel. For the money I paid it should have been a 4 star experience. The staff at the first desk was rude and when we asked for other hotel numbers she made sure they were to high in price so we were forced to stay there. The bedding was spotted so we don't know if the blankets were ever washed. We got up early the next morning to leave, we didn't stay for the breakfast we just had to get out of there ASAP. It was a horrible time and when we moved to the other hotel that we then spent the next three nights in we washed all of our clothing to get the nasty feel of dirt off of us. Please go anywhere else to stay other than the Days Inn Fashion Square Resort unless you know nasty hotel rooms.",negative
"Have been a fan of this place since we started staying here a few years back. It has a Rat Pack old school feel to it. All the rooms ring around a courtyard perfect for clam bakes. The pool is nothing to get a chubby about, but when your skin is melting off under the desert sun it works for a quick dip. The bar is centrally located right next to the pool. My peeps and I usually bring our own refreshments since the rooms have mini fridges, but the peace of mind that a cure is always close by helps soothe the drunky in me. The rooms are comfortable, but not glamorous by any stretch of the imagination. The walls do a good job of keeping the noise to the minimum. The rooms are cleaned thoroughly and the housekeepers are good about hooking up the extra towels when the wife needs to line the floor from the shower to the bed. Within walking distance of old town Scottsdale and the nightlife nearby. Also within spitting distance of the bombest mall EVER. It's like a triple decker MC Escher designed ode to consumerism. Plus they have the puppy store that the ladies always enjoy visiting. If you're looking for a place to lay your head go here. If you're looking for 4 star pampering like some whiner posted earlier get lost.",positive
"People here are one of the following: toothless, heavy smokers outside of their room on the balcony talking loud, people who likely live in a motorhome or trailer and are living the high-life here, or about 40 aging men softball players. Then, there is me -- a cratchedly grumbly snooty hotel-stayer. What it is: cheap; value-priced; great location next to the Fashion Square mall near Old Town Scottsdale; good for travelers; partiers, large groups needing a low-cost option. What it is NOT: vacation spot, relaxing, nice, clean, quiet. I didn't think I am a snob, but I undoubtedly officially have self-elected myself. The rooms need a desperate remodel. Never will I stay here again, unless of course, I lose some teeth, join a softball team, etc!",negative
"I stayed here overnight after seeing a concert at the Venue of Scottsdale. It was very clean. The room had a refrigerator which was a plus, but the only downside was that there was no microwave in the room.",positive
10 hours to service for Sticker decals replaced today (so far we are sitting in the parking lot still). A few weeks ago panels replaced took months to repair. They had the 5th Wheel almost a whole year replacing things needing repairs and we purchased it 1 year ago brand new. We drove over an hour to get here hoping it would be taken care of in the time they said it would be done. They didn't even have all the parts needed for the repairs. They forgot to lock one of the utility doors so on the way back home that fell off too. Bad experiences over and over again and we came here several times expecting a change . I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you like making payments for something you can't use. They like to blame time and parts on factory. If you need anything shipped takes 3-4 weeks for parts and always ship the wrong parts. Also blamed on factory. Would like them to make the mistakes right and just be honest. If it's going to take longer don't promise the customer that time frame . Desert Autoplex or Forest River we don't know who is to blame for these issues.,negative
Absolutely outstanding service! It doesn't get any better than Desert Autoplex RV. Had an issue with trailer wiring and they were quick to diagnose the issue and get me on the road fast and efficiently. Thank you so much everyone.,positive
"We purchased a Northwood Fox Mountain in March of this year and it was a very good experience. Mike Turner was our salesman and he was extremely helpful and responsive - Brian too! We had a few minor warranty issues which they just finished up and we got our trailer back before the date it was promised. Mike Royce was the service advisor and was excellent. Cody in the parts department along with the parts manager were also extremely helpful - sorry, I don't remember her name! I would definitely recommend Desert Autoplex. Terry & Diane Brown",positive
"There has been a lot of turnover in the service department at Desertautoplex which can lead to frustration as communications is a key principle for good customer service. After my most recent trip, I dropped of my coach with a list of about a dozen items to be resolved. My new service writer, Tom, was very open and candid and promised to keep me informed. Tom kept his word and provided me with updates along the way. I was also pleased the reasonable charges for some of the minor repairs. Because of Tom, I will return to this facility when I need service in the future.",positive
They were fair and honest with me and my wife. Brian helped us find the trailer we were looking for and he was very knowledgeable with the unit. Ask for Brian Knox!,positive
"I just wanna give a quick shout out to my husband Manny Cruz, that works as a RV Technician at Desert Autoplex! He always does a great job and goes in to work even on his day off! He works so hard to give clients the perfect service they need for their RV/AIRSTREAM! He is certainly goes over & Beyond for us at home I'm sure he will for his clients as well!",positive
"This rating is specifically for Brian Knox the sales representative we worked with to buy our first Airstream at Desert Autoplex. He was knowledgeable on Airstreams, kind, proficient, and patient as we went back and forth on the price. It took us some time to reach an agreement, but during this time he was very accommodating in making sure we had lunch, etc. Thanks, Brian!",positive
"I bought a used Class C from DAP RV. Coach Jim worked diligently to get me the price I wanted to pay. The paperwork didn't take forever, and the walk through with Bill was very thorough, and he added a lot of great tips. I felt very confident that I would have few questions. Christina in the parts department quickly set me up with everything I needed. It was a class act from start to finish. I highly recommend Desert Autoplex to anyone looking to buy an RV. I noticed quite a huge selection as well.",positive
"Buyer Beware of Desert Autoplex Recently bought a boat from Desert autoplex and the entire experience was appalling. I would never ever recommend anyone buying, selling, or having maintenance done to an RV, boat, or toaster within the confine of this mickey mouse operation. Even the cheapest prostitution joint in Mexico is run better and has better customer service than these A*ss wipes. I am surprised they can even figure out how to install a new water bottle onto of the water cooler!!!! All the positive review on here were left by their own employees. You can go and meet them today! When we looked at the boat it appeared to be in good shape. We were told that the craft was recently tested on a local lake and had all oil and fluid changes done to it. It also has a transom saver and original lounge tables that came with the boat. When we picked up the boat it was missing the tables and transom saver which they said that they would replace. On the trip back to the house the trailer was crashing against the hitch of the truck violently to the point we had to pull over to inspect it. Upon inspection the trailer hydraulic brakes had no fluid in them. Took us 2 extra hours to refill and bleed the 4 brakes on the trailer. Furthermore it's been two months since then and the tables have yet to be seen. I have called many times and never get a response First time on the lake that engine had issues idling and then would surge when under load. After taking it in 4 times to be repaired at Desert Autoplex (a ""certified mercury marine engine dealer"") we were told that they had to wait till another shop could fit the boat in for a appointment due to the fact that they did not have the equipment to diagnose the engine. Upon further inspection we found that the oil had not been changed. It took them three weeks to ""fix"" and the day I called I was told that the boat had just arrived from a lake test and was still having issues. I dropped by 5 min after the call and the boat and trailer was completely dry and had not moved from the week before. Finally after 3 weeks they said the boat was ready and was working fine. After picking up the craft we went to the lake and the surging still persisted. I found that there was an issue with the fuel bulb (that I was told was brand new) coming off the fuel tank, which I replaced myself. There is so so much more to this story(like ripping the rear hatch off when they were trailering it.) but my blood pressure is getting to high just by writing this review. In conclusion if you like to be lied to, cheated, and shafted take your business to Desert Autoplex. If you want a good experience go anywhere else. And for god sakes don't buy a boat from these clowns. (P.S.) I am taking 2 hours of my life to post this review to as many sites as possible because of the S*it experience I had there. Hopefully this safes a few people some stress, bottles of men's Rogaine foam, hair transplant treatments, and years off your life due to the stress this place will cause you. Cheers.",negative
"Changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star after 8 months of dealing with the warranty/service side of this business. I wish I never bought my Newmar here!! Calls and emails are not responded to, safety issues are inspected but not corrected and the coach is returned to you time after time with work half done or not done. There has been significant turnover and Desert Autoplex has dropped the ball many times. Communication and follow up has been incredibly poor. Newmar lists them as their preferred dealer in Phoenix. We'll be discussing our experiences with Newmar as they need to be aware of how poorly their brand is being represented in this market.",negative
"If we could give negative stars, we would. Our first encounter was searching for an AirStream travel trailer. Typically, when entering a vehicle lot, one is accosted by sales agents vying for your business. This place is just the opposite. We were serious about buying an AirStream so we pressed through being ignored, not once but twice. The sales agent admitted that he wasn't the expert in this class of trailer, but at least he didn't ignore us. Needless to say, we ended up going elsewhere to find our AirStream. Now, the real review. The LACK of service department. Unfortunately, this place is the only authorized AirStream service location in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We contacted the department (I will avoid using the word 'service' as much as I can) online. This was the only way we could get a response. Even though Jill Morris answered our online request in a rather timely manner, she rejected our calls, which went right to voicemail. The questions we had would have been much better answered in a voice call (both better for her and for us), but she refused. As we, like so many, work busy schedules, we asked if we could drop the unit on a Saturday even though the first drop off appointment wasn't until the following Thursday (for a Friday appointment). We were forced to take time off from work to drop our unit off the following Monday. On the Monday, we were told, by Jill, that there was a good chance that they could get the unit in before Thursday. The following Friday afternoon, I called to get an update on progress. Again, no calls were accepted; only directed to voicemail. The only way we were able to get any response was by email. The email responses were pathetic. The responses were run on sentences with no punctuation, misspellings, and grammar that would insult any first grade teacher. One would think that the sender thought they were texting a close friend in haste rather than a customer from a business address. Totally insulted, we then called the ""service manager"", who, by the way, never followed up with our dissatisfaction on lack of professionalism, lack of communication, or lack of keeping the CUSTOMER informed on the progress of the CUSTOMER's property. Instead, Jill emailed back with a half apology of making us very upset and using the excuse that she never claimed that she had ""good grammar"". Ugh. She claimed that our unit would be diagnosed of problem (not her words) the following Saturday and that we would get a phone call from Rick (the 'service manager'--title used very loosely) with an update. Needless to say, this, too never happened. We never got an update on that Saturday nor on the following Monday. On the following Tuesday, Rick did call saying that the issue was simply ' a ""bad fuse"" that wasn't covered by warranty, that AirStream knew nothing about us, and that we had better get that warranty stuff all worked out.' We find it odd that as an AirStream dealer, that this location would go out of their way to try to worry us about warranty issues when it is typical for transfer of warranty to take up to 45 days by AirStream (we took ownership less than 30 days prior). It is also VERY strange that a simple this ""service"" department now has our unit over a week for something that they claim is just a blown fuse. In asking for clarification of the issue, for cost of the repair, and for time when we can come get our property, now more than 5 phone calls and requests for return calls have been ignored. It would seem that, if this is the AUTHORIZED SEVICE PROVIDER for a particular mechanical product, that they should be: 1) knowledgeable, 2) efficient (the more one works on something, the more one knows it inside and out, the more quickly one is able to fix it, right?), 3) reputable. Maybe we just expect the same degree of professionalism, honesty and standards from others that we do from ourselves. This has been a pathetic experience. We are awaiting a response from AirStream for an alternative location to take our unit for service. Don't know if Tucson is any better. Can't be any worse. Or can it?",negative
"Having seen several less than great reviews, I am happy to share a very positive experience. Made an appointment to have a brake control installed and it was done under time and under budget. Tom, the service advisor and Juan who did the install were both Excellent.",positive
"I have owned five RVs through the years and dealt with a multitude of dealerships. The absolute worst, by far, is Desert Autoplex in Mesa, Arizona. First off: it takes several days and many phone calls to get someone to answer the phone. You get recorded responses such as: ""No one is available to take your call"" or, ""Hold on while I tried to connect you"" and then you get disconnected. Then when you do get someone, they are usually quite vague about whatever information you are calling for be it service, sales, or administration. I bought an RV from them which required some immediate maintenance. I picked it up after they handed me the signoff sheet and I trustingly drove off only to find a day later that some of the work had not been performed. There are some really nice people there trying to do their job but they seem very shorthanded and very poorly managed. There are many shortcomings, i.e., the telephone service, which could be handled easily if only the owner/manager would take an interest and do something. Note the BBB has a big REVOKED on its Desert Autoplex site.",negative
"I have been here a couple times and the experience was good until today 4/1/2017. My wife and I are pretty close to acquiring an Airstream. In an effort to determine affordability options I asked to speak their finance team to understand the term and rates available. Instead of getting a finance manager they sent the sales manager to speak with me. He told me I have to negotiate price before I can understand what available financing options are...and told me if I don't like them, "" then you can go to your own bank"" . I expressed my income range, told them I could provide them with the FICO score they needed to estimate my rates and term. As well as providing an estimated loan to value to work from. The sales manager wasn't polite and stated that they sell ""ten units daily"" and ""this is how we do it here""... I like Brian Knox the sales rep, he is great, so I'm not sure whether to still consider this facility anymore.",negative
"They really do know how to insult people! Wanted to possibly trade my boat in if the price was right. Low retail for my boat is 39,000. They just offered me 17.000! Insulting and we were dealing with one then got left with another for the ol bait and switch! I'm happy to keep my boat, thanks!!!",negative
"If I could rate this a zero, I would...I took my 2015 Ventana there for service (based on Newmars recommendation) in mid may....I just got it back in mid august (just short of three months!)...no one would call me (even after two visits to the store personally where they promised to my face they would call me very week), I had no idea what was going on...I was (finally) told to come to the store to pick up my vehicle (after ten weeks) and when I showed up, the coach was STILL not repaired (repairs noted at the time of checkin in may)...I was (seriously) not happy...my coach finally got back to my place this week (after almost three months)...I would NEVER recommend Desert Autoplex for either service or sales...if they can't fix them, they should not sell them!",negative
"This place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! We purchased a boat there a few weeks ago and after taking it out twice on the lake it wouldn't start! We called 10.... Yes 10 times to get it into the shop for repairs! They even hung up on me once! They were ZERO help fixing our boat. We then decided to call Conplete Marine and they were sooo helpful. Helped us diagnose our boat over the phone since they weren't able to get it in that day their shop. We had to pick up our part from CP Marine and the mechanic was also super helpful giving my husband tips on how to change it out. Everyone you talk to has a different answer, so be careful what you believe at Desert Autoplex. We were told our boat came with a 1 year warranty that would cover us, well when we were signing paper work that showed to be false. We were also told they would do a complete run,test, and over view of the engine before we took it off the lot to make sure everything was perfect for us..... They didn't! The spark plugs were old and rusted and needed to be changed, the main breaker switch wasn't working it was jammed and needed to be replaced, the battery was about 10 years old and needed to be replaced..... So I would say they did nothing!! My husband also noticed out rear tail light on the trailer was out. When he opened it to check the bulb the entire house for the light fell apart and was rusted... The guys in the shop told us no problem they would order a new one and we could pick up next week... But do you think we can get ahold of them for it?? Take your business else where, this place is a joke!",negative
I was surprised to see all the great reviews on Desert Autoplex RV. Maybe we visited on an off day but I would never go back. My husband and I wanted to look at RV's and that seemed to be the problem. We were looking and not buying. The sales person was like a vulture and when we said we were only looking he responded very rudely. If his intention was to have us leave it worked. We left and will never go back.,negative
"Desert Autoplex was wonderful to deal with start to finish. Nancy and Brian were great salespeople. Brian was very knowledgeable no matter which unit we looked at and they were both extremely patient no-pressure, no-hassle. Both finance guys Justin and Joe were great, again, no pressure and no hassle. The delivery man, Shawn was AWESOME. He did the walk-through with us and repaired everything he could find wrong with the coach before we ever checked it out. He answered all our questions and even made a couple additional repairs we found during the walk through. Art was great and helped us out when our salesman or finance guys were off. This entire experience was absolutely wonderful. This dealership goes out of their way to be awesome and truly seemed to appreciate our business. Everyone we encountered thanked us for our business even if they weren't involved in the sale.",positive
"If you have a choice, get on a plane, bus, or car and go there right now for anything RV. Top notch sales staff, service with honesty and integrity. It's your money, spend it where you will feel good about the transaction!",positive
"This place was a high pressure sales tactic. They also dont list prices and were trying to sell at much higher proces then we've seen elsewhere. If they ask you to come inside afterwards, dont do it!",negative
"I did a great deal of research back in May of 2015 over the internet but decided to see what Desert Autoplex could do to compete...what a surprise! Not only did they compete we had the personal and zero pressure from a very informative Sales and Delivery staff! CJ and Art were fantastic and came within a few hundred dollars of the best price I could find on my Forest River XLR. When it came to the delivery, our RV was impeccable and the delivery crew spent all the time needed covering everything. The reason it took me so long to write this is because I now have a chance to compliment their service. As for any RV after a few trips you will encounter some issues, the Service Manager Christina, and even the owner Aaron was so accommodating and totally understood each of my squawks (aircraft term) and ensured everything would be covered. Class act team of professionals...when I upgrade, Aaron, CJ, Art and the whole team will certainly get a visit from me!!!",positive
"Stopped at Desert Autoplex to browse their Class A motorhomes. Unfortunately, the same rude sales person was still there. We ran into this guy last year when we were looking and should have learned our lesson and stayed away. Last year he told us, without knowing any of our information, we could not afford the coach we were looking at. This year he told us we were wasting his time and we shouldn't be looking at million dollar coaches if we had $100,000 budget (never discussed any price range). I guess his mother never taught him not to judge a book by its cover. My husband told him he was retired from the Air Force and the guy said ""oh, sorry about that"". Nice thing to say to a veteran. Will definitely take our business elsewhere and encourage our RV friends to do the same.",negative
"Mike Hewett is a very responsive and knowledgable salesman. We did not purchase from him because we chose a different used unit elsewhere that fit our needs better, but Mike was the best salesman we came across - someone that would help us be successful quickly.",positive
"No pressure and informative sales persons. Easy to work with fro sales to finance to service. Worked hard to earn my business and I respect that. Will definitely return for further purchases. First timer purchasing a class A was a difficult decision for me and this dealer worked with me to the deal was comfortable for me. I cannot say that about their neighbor CW. After several months of looking at many different RVs and visiting several dealers, this was one of a few that treated their customers with respect. They are busy and have a diverse inventory but are patient though negotiations. Honest to boot!",positive
"I've had my RV serviced here 3 times. They do s stellar job! Lori in Service is excellent at listening to what's wrong and questioning to verify understanding. She's also on top of everything and gives timely updates as repairs are being completed. I bought my RV in Florida so, typically, we would expect to be put at the bottom of their list of customers. Just the opposite is true - I'm treated as if I bought it there. Lori is a winner - Desert Autoplex is lucky to have her.",positive
Beware of this place. They low ball the hell out of you on the trade in. Then jack the price up on the trailer you're interested in. I would not do business with this company.,negative
"Desert Autoplex has been around since the late nineties when they started out in Scottsdale where I bought my Bmw 3-series convertible. They advanced into being an RV dealer including taking on several new lines of trailers including Airstream and they have a huge selection of motorhomes including Newmar. I bought my first RV ever from them last month, an amazing class C by Forest River powered by the Mercedes diesel motor. We have already put on 5,000 miles and have traveled several states. I just found out they have grown again in size and have now taken over a huge facility that used to house McMahons rv on main street just east of Gilbert road. I plan on only servicing my new baby at their expanded service center. They're now conveniently right next door to Camping World where I used to buy accessories for my pop-up trailer. Now I'm just waiting for their new accessories boutique store to open soon. Check out these guys if you're in the market. The sales staff is very pleasant and the owner is right by their side working and making everything flow perfectly smooth.",positive
"Great place to buy a vehicle. I was in the market for a acura mdx 2003-2006 for my wife and was looking locally for a while. The private sellers that were selling them and the small dealers that had some in stock were not very well kept regarding the interior and exterior condition. In addition they were overpriced. I continued looking and found one listed through eBay. From the pictures of this mdx listed by Desert Autoplex was one of the cleanest I'd ever seen. I contacted Eric about the vehicle, who was great to work with,any questions I had he'd answer or he'd get back to me within a couple of hours. He provided records and receipts proving how well maintained this vehicle was. Well I drove 350+ miles from hesperia ca in a rental because the vehicle and price were no doubt worth it. When we arrived there we were greeted with refreshments and were allowed to inspect and drive the vehicle. It was just as described and pictured online. No picture cropping or misinformation. They were a pleasure to do business with and would do business with them again without hesitation. They also sell some brand new nice looking Rv's and streamliners. Thanks again Desert Autoplex.",positive
"I recently purchased a 2009 Toyota Prius for my daughter from Desert Autoplex. I worked with Lorenda and it was a pleasure doing business with her. Everyone was courteous, friendly and helpful. There was no pressure and I liked how they let me test drive the car alone without any selling during the drive. I took it to a Toyota dealer for a pre-purchase inspection and Desert Autoplex took care of a few minor items before the purchase. They were also very flexible in meeting me at my credit union to make the final transaction. It was a fair price and my daughter is thrilled with the car! This is the first time I've made a purchase from an independent car dealer. I was a little hesitant at first but they made the whole experience easy. I would definitely do business with them again.",positive
"I made a 12 day reservation with Dollar in October so I could avoid the holiday rush and prices. When my flight arrived at 11:40 I went directly to the the Dollar counter only to find no one there. They are suppose to close at 12:00 and other vendor like Avis and Hertz were open. Dollar cancelled my reservation and when I called them the following morning they could not offer me the same deal. Their price at that time was 1.5 times the price I had in October. In addition they tried to make it my fault for the loss of the reservation. I ended up renting a car from another vendor. I will NEVER RENT FROM DOLLAR AGAIN. Bad service. No Respect for reservations. No acceptance of responsibility and Dollar, not the customer come first. You will be Wise to choose someone else too.",negative
"I will NEVER rent from Dollar again. I rented a car in Pittsburgh and went through several cashless tolls in WV. I called Dollar when I learned this and they said just to opt in to their toll paying service when I return the vehicle. When I return the vehicle, I learn that that option is not applicable to my vehicle. I have tried calling customer service and all I get is ""we will wait and see what happens"". What is going to happen is a $15.00 administrative fee capped at $90 plus the tolls. Even the WV toll authority said to let them know that I wish to handle the charges. Dollar will not allow me to do that. Thus I am beating them to the punch and changing my credit card number before they can charge my card. This place is really something else.",negative
"Dollar car rental is great! Great customer service, easy to reserve and fast checkout, and great prices. The cars are great too.",positive
"I had a really good experience working with Dollar rentals at Pittsburgh International Airport. The car was clean, no problems, and the two folks who helped me during pickup and drop off were really nice and eager to help.",positive
"I was overcharged approximately $250 by these people. When I called their customer service and complained, they promised to issue a refund FOR THEIR MISTAKE. A month later - no refund. So I had to call AGAIN and speak to another series of consistently less-than-helpful customer service people who said that I had to call back AGAIN and ask for a different department and then hung up on me. My opinion: NEVER rent a car from Dollar. They are incompetent and now I have to go through the hassle of disputing the charges with VISA. Terrible experience. I would give zero stars if I could.",negative
"We reserved a compact or better car thru hotwire.com. Went to Dollar at the airport to pick up and asked if there was something better. Troy gave us a Chevy Spark, a car neither of us had even heard of. Arrived at the parking spot and were highly disappointed, especially since we were surrounded by many much better vehicles on a slow Sunday. Didn't realize until we checked on line at our hotel that we didn't even get a compact or better, but an economy level vehicle. Shame on you Troy and DollarRent a car. Very shoddy interaction. Driving our tin can around the hills of Pittsburgh reminds us everyday not use Dollar again.",negative
"Crooks and should be turned in for fraud. Never renting from Dollar again. To go more in detail, this is about the second or third time renting from them. First time, no issue. We were wondering what the bad reviews were about. Then this time, Dollar's true colors shined. We rented the car in Pgh, PA, no problem. We had the car for a long weekend, no car wrecks, no accidents, nothing. Not even a scratch. Returned the car to someone who worked for Dollar who actually LOOKED IT OVER AS WE RETURNED IT, and no problem. Then about 2 or 3 weeks later, I got a call from Dollar Claims in FL telling me I had to pay about $500+ for an accident that I NEVER had. They said they sent a letter out a while ago to my billing address explaining it. To this day, I still haven't gotten that letter. My fianc√© and I both have asked for this letter to be sent out. My current residential address is out of state, and they stated a few weeks ago they would send me a letter... Again, no letter. They called me again, and I asked for another letter... Still waiting for it. We find it a little odd that this ""letter"" hasn't made it to one of our addresses, yet they keep trying to collect money from us! Fraud all over it if you ask me. Absolutely never renting from them again. I would actually give zero stars if I could. Their company needs to be investigated for fraud AND shut down. I will willingly pay more to rent a car from somewhere who actually treats their customers with respect and doesn't try and collect money without proof.",negative
"Employees were courteous, got the car quickly (via dollar express membership - avoiding all of the usual upsells), and had no trouble with the return (having kept/shown my sub-10 mile gas receipt), but despite having reserved a compact, I was provided a tiny chevy spark sub-compact (the image next to the ""economy"" class on their website). Otherwise, the car was clean and had XM, but assigning something as tiny as a chevy spark to someone who made a compact reservation is borderline fraud in my book. Luckily it was a short reservation, and I didn't get into any trouble due to the seriously underpowered engine.",negative
The worst. 100% horrible. No one use Dollar Rent A Car ever. They are crooks and will over charge and straight up rip you off at every turn. There are plenty of other car rental companies to use if you must rent a car. I'd give them ZERO stars if it were an option.,negative
They added a nearly $10 charge for gasoline even though I returned it completely full. Was assured by the agent that it would be credited back. It wasn't. Have not been able to get them to remove the charge. I've rented from Dollar satisfactorily in other locations but will never do business here again. Avoid at all costs.,negative
id give them zero stars if it were an option. Honestly....this company is borderline corrupt! I will not rent from them again. ive never had a worse experience........actually ive never had a bad experience til dollar. go to any other company not dollar!,negative
Terrible!! The staff at front desk is awful! Went for our best friends wedding there!( their wedding planner is amazing) just the night front desk lady Denise was the rudest person! She was so mean and told us she didn't care we called the manager on her! Curtains In rooms do not shut with big lights right outside,negative
Always stay here when flight early. Very clean. Very easy to find wendys and bob evans across street an few others They take u to airport an pic u up. Never a problem room always clean if something wrong they will correct it. They have pool and bar restaurant always friendly and u get a cookie and bittle watet,positive
"Hotel not bad, clean. The toilet way too close to the shower/tub. Is that so you go and still be in the shower? LOL. AC in my room made noise all night. :/ Late night shuttle ride and check in. Both the shuttle driver and front desk guy obviously not happy with their jobs, because it shows. Overall, not bad.",negative
Great experience at this hotel. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Easy parking. Clean room. They have fruit at the front counter. Excellent choice if you are flying out of the Pittsburgh airport.,positive
"Really nice, relaxing, awesome hotel. It was exactly what we needed. A great nights rest. Lots of space. Did I mention it was relaxing? :) We picked this place since we had an early morning flight out the next day. Unfortunately we weren't here long since we checked in late, but it was sooo wonderful nonetheless. Front desk folks were so polite and nice. Lots of parking in their large parking lot. It was awesome all the way down to the thick, absorbent, soft and luxurious towels!",positive
"Probably 2.5 stars. Attended an event. They ran out of the entree with more than 20 people left to serve and did not replenish. What food we had was OK, typical buffet. No coffee or ice tea. I guess you could buy it but we were out of money with $10 house wine and $8 domestic beer. I understand the rooms were hot, dark and small. Luckily we did not have to spend the night. Thought Doubletree would be a lot better.",negative
"Stopped in Pittsburgh on a family vacation, I'm a Hilton honors member so I tried to book a room in the Hilton by the airport. Called and was immediately transferred to reservations without even hearing the date I wanted to reserve. After over 40 min on hold with reservations, I gave up and booked online. When the confirmation came, it was for the following week!!! After another 20 minutes, I managed to correct the reservation. By then, we arrived at the hotel, which of course was largely empty. Asked for a room with 2 beds, was given a price over 30% more than the online price!!!was Told by the rude clerk that they couldn't match online prices, despite me showing her the reservation. The manager wasn't any help either. The only answer they had was no and we can't! Left and went next door to the Marriott, got a king with a couch bed and a roll out for $89, $40 less than the Hilton. Avoid this hotel",negative
"Excellent rooms, beds, and pillows. There's a Pok√©Stop right outside the front door and we could reach it from most places in the hotel. Most staff were very friendly although we did have one interaction with a manager and a desk attendant who were rude. The restaurant offered nothing that looked exciting and was overpriced. But, still...the room sizes, beds, pillows, and most of the staff merit four stars. I wish there was a 4.5 rating.",positive
"The double tree is always a good stay!!! I mean always a good stay!! I enjoyed the cookie once we checked in:) The front staff was really nice and in our room we had a fridge and there was a microwave in the downstairs com an area. It was great. We stayed here about a week ago to make the trip easier to the airport the night before. With our flight leaving at 0600 and us living an hour and a half from the airport, not to mention its 2hour ahead check in for international flights! So we opted to stay at a hotel near the airport. Smart move on me and the Hubby's part:-)the room was super clean and it had a bath tub and a shower! TV was a good size and cable of course. However we usually flip straight to HGTV. If you are looking for a nice stay pick the double tree!",positive
"I ordered my room through a third party site which was $26 cheaper a night than with my HHonors and ordering directly from the hotel site. I was already disappointed by that. Check in was fine. The room has a bizarre layout. You can't open the door, closet, or bathroom simultaneously with any combination of the three. So good luck if you're trying to exit the bathroom while someone is in the closet! You're literally stuck. The pool is in the lower level which is a little weird. It had a strong smell of chlorine but was cloudy. There was a group of kids acting wild jumping/diving, running and jumping between the hot tub (which is right next to the indoor pool) and the pool. There were absolutely NO towels in the swimming area! I used the phone to call the front desk and no one answered! I tried several times before finally giving up and walking with two dripping wet kids to the front desk. The attendant could have cared less that there weren't towels or why no one answered the phone. I did advise she send someone down to check on the pool. I asked for house keeping to bring towels to our room (you only get 2 towels in the bathroom) but a half hour later we still hadn't received towels and called the front desk again. They don't offer complimentary breakfast but suggest you buy the $12.99 breakfast option. We passed. The room had hair in the bathroom, sticky floor around toilet and a big chunk of hair by the bed on the floor. It comes with a refrigerator and microwave right next to the bed! Don't count on them to ask how your stay was when you check out either. I was literally told ""ok you're good"" and that was the extent of my conversation with the front desk attendant.",negative
"Four nights here in what feels like a really bad steerage room in a tiny boat. The bathroom is small...too small with absolutely ZERO counter space. God help you if you try to open the door and someone left the closet open even the tiniest bit. It is too close and I'm surprised that any building codes allow such a dangerous flaw. You could easily get locked out or trapped in a fire. I think this crappy building was built after they stopped building anything with character in Pennsylvania and before they had any building codes or inspections. Truly a dump. The bed sags. The hallways are dark and cramped. The rooms are old and beyond help. The air conditioner seems to run when it wants and 72 can be 68 one night and 78 the next. 72 has yet to mean 72. That being said, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I increased my review from one to two stars based SOLELY on the staff. Come on Hilton, time to sell this old place to Super 8 and build something new. This is a serious blemish on your otherwise generally clear complexion.",negative
"Nice room! Booked online for 5 adults. When arrived they didn't have a room for 5. Didn't want us to have a roll away bed. Said they could only give us an extra blanket and pillow. As much as I love my mother n law, me my husband and her cant fit in a double bed. Lady at desk wanted to argue more than help us. We even offered to leave and find a different hotel. Finally they agreed to give us a roll away. Kept saying it was a fire hazard. Finally I said, I guess one of us will die if there's a fire.",negative
"From the warm cookie at check in, I knew this place was going to be great. Lol The front desk staff was awesome. Even though I'm from the area, they still let me in on some hidden gems in the area. Eggs N'at next door is great! I had to call down there once because of a noisy guest in the hallway (literally sitting down and leaning on my door, talking on her cell at 12am.. Drunk much?? Lol) and the matter was handled immediately. Anyhow, the hotel was kept up very nicely. Everything was cleaned to perfection. The housekeeping staff member that I interacted with one morning was super sweet and nice, and recommended her favorite lunch spot down the street when I was looking for some place I wasn't aware of - which just so happened to also be my fave in the area, so we had a little laugh. Primanti's... OMG drool!! Yum! The rooms are HUGE. The beds and pillows are dreamy. If you get on the back side of the hotel you get some real great views. This is literally close to everything. If you head north there are gas stations, Walgreens, McDonald's, and a Dunkin Donuts (which is about the only thing open late..) If you head south you will find Arby's, more gas stations, Eggs N'at. Directly across the street is a Bob Evans. Even if your daily destination is on the other side of the airport, it only takes about 7-10 minutes to get around the south end. Great location!! Also.. If you're signed up with Hilton Rewards, you get points for your stay which eventually end up earning you free nights.",positive
"Bad, bad, bad - like sleeping in Times Square! Horrendous cacophony of noise throughout the night - and I have no idea why. There was a continual barrage of thudding noises from the room above all night long. Like there was a really obese guy jumping around. But it couldn't have been that, so it must be something to do with maintenance. It makes no sense. The floor and wall structures here are very weak, poorly designed and simply cannot shield the vibrations. On top of that there's a relentless slamming of doors ever 15 minutes, again no idea why!!! I did get a clue as to why the sound comes into the room - there's a quarter inch gap at the bottom of each door that they have failed to cover. This doesn't explain the vibration issue or why someone is jumping around the place but it does explain why the sound travels into the room. The gap at the bottom of the door should be sealed with a sweep or smoke retarder device which will also prevent sound, but on my room door there was clear sunlight. I saw this on many doors. The noise may have been exacerbated for me by the fact that my room was close to the side stairwell. In itself the location should not be a problem - but they need to ensure the stair well doors have padding to reduce noise and proximate rooms are especially sound proof which they haven't done. It wouldn't surprise me if the lack of door sealer is also a fire safety risk as well. Attitude at check-in was OK, but later I called down to the desk to find out if they had a shaving kit and the same concierge (a middle aged lady) confirmed they had some items and I could come and get them, but with a very bad attitude like I was an idiot. This doesn't change my rating though - it was just that one person - subsequent encounters with staff were fully pleasant. Sometimes you can get a one-off bad experience. Bed was very bumpy and soft. Like sleeping on a huge sponge, very uncomfortable. Pillow's and sheet covers had a musty smell (like sweat/body odur) and my suspicion is that they might have been only lightly used by the previous guest and rather than replace the cleaner just straightened them out. During the whole stay there, there was a ladder parked up against the front entrance canopy - and this is a very big clue if you plan to stay here. The maintenance is shoddy. Admitedly there was some sort of maintenance going on, but can you imagine just leaving a ladder up against the front entrance of your home for days? I generally like Double Tree - but not this one. Take my advice and avoid, this place isn't worth it - but if you do decide to gamble and stay here just do two things: 1. Insist on being away from the side stairwell. 2. Check the bottom of your door is sealed. Ignore my advice at your peril and be prepared to experience a long night in HELL!!!!!",negative
I am surprised to find an excellent restaurant at a double tree hotel next to an airport. Kudos to the chef. I had the sous vide short ribs and they were as good as in a 3 Michelin restaurant,positive
"Two part review! Don't you just love them? PART 1: I initially came here to attend a wedding. I have never really been to a hotel for a wedding before, so I was expecting a somewhat unglamorous experience. Boy, was I wrong. They put on a magnificent event that included everything from the ceremony to the reception right on premise. The ceremony itself was held outside on their patio area. They set the area up beautifully with white chairs that formed an aisle to allow the wedding party make their way to the front. To say that the ceremony was quick is an understatement. It literally was over before I knew it. After the ceremony everyone moved inside for cocktails and appetizers. The area used for this was rather small or at least it felt that way. Maybe that was because everyone seemed to gather at one side instead of taken advantage of the whole space. I assume that when a person books a wedding here they are booking a package deal. I am not sure what the package deals are like, but the one that I attended included an open bar which seemed to please many people. The bartenders were very pleasant and able to make any drink you could think of with the supplies they had. I did not partake in the appetizer portion so I cannot speak of the taste, but it was a pretty impressive spread of finger foods. Once cocktail hour was over we were all encouraged to enter the ballroom area for the reception. The way it was set up gave you the notion that it was an expansive space. Dance floor in the middle with the bridal party table and tables on both sides for the guests. Two bar areas set up to attend to the guests needs and food was served by service staff. The food was pretty amazing I must say. I'm sure each package can mix and match to accommodate the tastes of all the guests. I remember there being three selections for choosing. Beef, chicken and a vegetarian friendly option. They also had a section for you to list any allergies you may have so you can avoid a catastrophe. It was basically a four course meal served to you. Appetizer was two rather big raviolis stuffed with spinach and feta cheese. Balsamic vinegar and oil lined the plate while an alfredo sauce topped the raviolis. When all were combined the taste was quite amazing. Up next was the salad. Field greens with a nice mixture of the basic vegetables you'd find in a salad. The entree was pretty amazing. Chicken breast with a delightful sauce placed over some asparagus spears with a side of colorful potatoes. The only thing I cannot judge here was the cake due to my allergies. Once dinner was served the dance floor began to get full and everyone danced the rest of the night away. Of course there was a cookie table; it was a Pennsylvania wedding ;) _____________________________________________________________ Part 2: Hotel review: Check in was a smooth process. A few clicks on the computer and programming of the room key and I was on my way. During check in they offer you a cookie. Unfortunately for me I was not able to partake due to allergies (God, I sound like a broken record). Even though I could not partake in a cookie, they were able to offer me a piece of fresh fruit, pretty amazing. The room itself was pretty amazing. HUGE is an understatement for the space in the room. All the amenities you would find in a typical hotel room. Free WiFi! Local TV stations and some basic cable. Let us talk about the bathroom a bit. This was a little bit of a 'meh' area. Don't get me wrong, everything was nice...except the tub. There were numerous nicks in the tub, maybe even something like gashes. The lighting was pretty bad as well. It is very dim and hard to see. One thing I did like about this is that the trash can was divided. One side for trash and one side for recycling. The only bad thing about my room was the location, right next to the stairwell. I know there was nothing they could do about it and it's not their fault. However, it's not fun hearing the doors slam all the time when people use them. Also, housekeeping, check out is by noon. If you see the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, leave it at that.",positive
"We arrived late in the evening and was greeted with an energetic sincere smile. The gentleman must've been psychic 'cause he immediately pulled out those warm carby chocolate chip walnut cookies. Since I was busy slamming those treats up my nostrils for an awakening whiff, the better half checked us in. There are hotels left and right within this area since the Pittsburgh Airport is about 5 minutes away but our habit of choice is DoubleTree. Please remember, if you prefer the convenience of being near the airport you will hear the planes. I know...should be obvious. Free wifi as usual (thank ye) and free parking. I swear most of the cars parked are rentals from the airport lol so this is very beneficial. Now this location does not offer free bottles of water or at least not in our room. But each floor has a Coke vending machine and at $1.50 Dasani is available. Oh and Bigelow is their brand for hot tea. I was tickled that there's a Sheetz about a block away since we don't have that gas station/convenient store chain in our urban 'hood. Grab your snackable munchies and gratifying liquids there. Plus if you crave breakfast for dinner then head over to Bob Evans across the street. They too have free wifi so we nommed there while working on our iPad mini and laptop. For bath and body you will find Crabtree & Evelyn's Citron line. Overall a solid 3-star business-friendly hotel chain experience. They're consistently accommodating and professional. I've used them for workshops/meetings in my past life and I continue to consider them for work-related trips/events.",negative
An older property. The toilet leaked all over the floor. Lighting in room was poor. Typical over priced drinks and food.,negative
"7:30 am. And they're doing construction in the hotel. ??? perfect way to start the morning, especially since I'm stayin overnight due to a flight cancellation. Literally, HOW DO YOU LET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WORK ON YOUR HOTEL AT 730 in the morning. Beyond comprehension",negative
"This is a winner of a hotel. Nicely apportioned rooms, good bar and restaurant, and friendly staff. Don't know if I'll be back in Pittsburgh any time soon, but if so, this place will be on the short list of places to stay.",positive
"Very small radius for the shuttle. Lots of aircrew get stuck at this hotel for extended periods of time and can go nowhere. Doesn't matter how nice a place is, if you're trapped you don't like it there. They will take you downtown for $5, though. Really? Do they make a lot of money on that? Doubtful. My guess is that they are fully capable of transporting people anywhere, but just don't want to. Even their most reliable customers. Aircrew should try to avoid and encourage their companies to find other hotels.",negative
"I only stayed here for one night in one of the cheaper rooms but everything about the hotel was great. They have a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. They have a business center with two computers and printers, a fax machine and a photocopier. On site, they have a restaurant (where I had a very delicious lunch) and bar. There's also a 24 hour convenience ""store"" with some snacks, drinks, medication and other toiletries. From what I read, they have a gym, pool and hot tub as well but I didn't have the opportunity to try them. They have free Wi-fi throughout the entire hotel. Check-in was a breeze and they give you a warm chocolate chip cookie. The room was incredibly spacious with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. I normally wake up a few times during the night, but not here. They have starbucks coffee and Tazo tea in the room and in the bathroom, all Neutrogena products. I'd definitely recommend staying here.",positive
"My husband Rick and I stayed here last weekend (12/6/08-12/7/08). We went to the Christmas celebration at Old Economy Village that Saturday Night and the following day we went to a football party at one of Rick's friends who lived nearby. Not wanting to drive all the way back to Squirrel Hill only to return the next day, we found a great rate for this hotel on www.hotwire.com The Doubletree is absolutely wonderful for a one-night get away! They have wonderful little touches like free hot beverages all day and fresh cookies upon check in (always good for this diabetic in case she ""goes low"" in the middle of the night--and she did!). The rooms here are absolutely spacious. Rick and I had one of the ""smaller"" rooms, the Standard King. The room includes work desk with ergonomic chair, and something I've never seen in a hotel before-- 27"" flat screen TVs. The beds are very firm and have lots of pillows on them. Some of the larger rooms include suites and living rooms. The Doubletree also has a pool and a fitness room, both of which we made use of. The pool is a little small, but you can do ""mini-laps"" in it if you want. The fitness room is your typical hotel fitness room with a couple of universal fitness machines and a few cardio machines. I liked being able to do a work-out before breakfast for a change. The only drawback to these larger hotels is that they usually don't offer a complimentary breakfast. In fact, breakfast at these places can usually be expensive. Although their restaurant, Jackson's was a little more moderate than many hotel restaurants, it's strange how they don't show the nearby Bob Evans on their website listings for nearby restaurants. We ate there instead and saved a lot of money. That aside, this is a terrific hotel.",positive
"This was one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at. The employee who checked us in was not very friendly but that didn't make an impact on our stay, and another employee kind of had an attitude as well. They give you free appetizers and 2 drinks included in your stay.",positive
I do like the Drury hotels. The rooms are spacious and modern. They do provide meals but I have found the quality of food has decreased. Staff are always friendly.,positive
"I stayed at Drury inn while visiting my sick grandma in North Carolina. I must say they made the stay a great one. I didn't come in contact with one rude person, the guests are even really nice. This hotel is worth every cent. You get breakfast and dinner everyday, which Tate's so delicious. Free coffee all day and popcorn. I even had a little coffee machine in the room I stayed in. When I go back down I know where I will be staying. Already recommended Drury inn to my family members that are going down. A huge thank you to the staff at Drury inn you mad my stay a great one you guys are all the best!!! Much love.",positive
I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff was very focused on customer service. All employees were friendly and talkative. Our room was clean and nice. They served a great hotel breakfast and dinner. I would definitely stay again!,positive
"First class all the way. Lovely staff, incredible ""kickback"" offering with free hot food and drinks (2 complimentary alcoholic drinks for the adults),scrumptious breakfast buffet. Clean, eye-pleasing rooms, comfy beds and a pool. Couldn't ask for more. I will always look for a Drury wherever our travels take us.",positive
"Outstanding service. Welcomed when we arrived, room was great. Breakfast is awesome -- the whole crew working stepped up when there were large groups for breakfast. The meeting room space is great.",positive
"My family lives in Charlotte, so we are locals. We had a pipe break, flooding our house, which caused us to move into the hotel while the house was being repaired. I can honestly say that the people at the Drury Inn were about the nicest around. They knew about our situation and were so helpful while we were there - around three weeks! The hotel is a very clean, nice and comfortable. It was very quiet, as well. It was nice having a good breakfast and dinner (with drinks) included each day! Considering our long stay there, it was amazing to see how consistently helpful and friendly they were. Thank you to the staff and management for a great stay!",positive
"We came and stayed here for soccer! The staff was very accommodating, polite, professional, and friendly. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was amazing! I want to give a special shout out to Tim! He was one of the most professional and customer service driven people I have met in a long time! We will definitely be returning! Edited to include....after we already checked out, we came back to the hotel after the soccer game bc it was freezing rain and the boys needed to change out of their clothes! The staff let us use the facilities and gave us towels! If I can give more than 5 stars, I will!",positive
"This is my first time staying at Drury Inn and it's by far the absolute BEST hotel I've stayed at EVER and I've stayed at many as I travel for business. First, the welcome and courtesy of all staff including management is unmatched. I mean, everyone spoke to me, asked me how was I doing and just overall extremely friendly. It scared me so, I had to pinch myself to make sure I hadn't died and gone to heaven because this isn't the norm from my hotel experiences. The king room is a decent size and very clean. The bed is oh so soft and comfy with five fluffy pillows, (which I like). The walk-in shower is nice with what I think is a little seat attached in case you get lazy while showering, idk . The free reception isn't anything like I've experienced. Normally these receptions have finger foods and bottled beverages. No, not here! Their reception included a full course meal: chicken fajitas, Spanish rice with black beans, large baked potatoes, chicken noodle soup, loaded potato soup with bacon, hot dogs, nachos with cheese, jalape√±os and salsa, salad, and with all the trimmings, plus TWO free alcoholic beverages and unlimited non alcoholic beverages. Breakfast was equally astounding; biscuits and peppered gravy, sausage patties, scrambled eggs, hash browns, waffles, yogurt, cereals, fruit and unlimited beverages: soda, juice, coffee and tea. They also allow you to take food to your room and come back for seconds. I didn't do that, just overheard management telling someone that. This place is beyond impressive and I've already booked another stay for our family vacation in Memphis this December for $115 a night. Totally recommend this place and they're not that expensive, especially for everything you get. $124 a night here is a steal in my opinion.",positive
"All the staff here was so nice and accommodating. The place looks good and they have free breakfast and dinner and give drink tickets. They also have an indoor outdoor / pool. I did not want to leave! We stayed here while waiting to move into a new house, so I was happy to learn of this great local hotel that I can direct friends and coworkers to in the future.",positive
"From the minute we walked in until the moment we left we received exceptional service from every staff member that we encountered. My first statement upon arrival was ""it smells so clean in here"". Check in and check out were pleasant and quick. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The breakfast was one of the best I have seen, hot and cold items available, plenty of seating, and friendly staff. Even the landscaping at this hotel is well thought out and perfectly maintained. The managers of this hotel obviously take great pride in this hotel. Can't wait to stay again.",positive
"Great rooms. Great ""drink hour"". We had enormous ""snacks"". Truly, we didn't need dinner! The assistant manager was a GEM. Every day she was checking in on everyone. Then breakfast, another huge selection. This might be my new favorite. Forget HI, HI express or Hamptons. This was excellent! I hope their rewards program pays off.",positive
"Love love this hotel! It's very clean and interior is up to date. The employees are very nice. The prices are so worth it because they offer so many nice deals. Also, they give out free good quality food for breakfast and what they call 'kickback' (it's more like dinner). I highly recommend this place! They have security outside at night to make guests feel more secure.",positive
"We always try to stay at Drury Inn when possible. They are clean, comfortable and the people are friendly and helpful. The breakfast and evening offerings are good. Highly recommend.",positive
"You'll be hard-pressed to find something better in this price range. Great staff. General Manager friendly and engaged with customers and his staff- helping out as needed. Food great, rooms VERY comfortable and clean, good amenities. Family-owned chain with treat-guests-as-family philosophy.",positive
As a first time with drury i really like this hotel. The staff is awesome and very nice and courteous. The hotel is clean outside and in. You can tell it's pretty new. They are located right off major highways and everything seems close by and easy driving. The hotel has a fitness room that's a +++++++++. Machines are good quality and clean and towels. For cars. Parking lot is safe and you can see your car from room. The pool is pretty cool inside. The breakfast is very good. Better than most hotels in have come in North Carolina. The rooms where super clean. I like it because is NO SMOKING. The hotel always smells good and the beds are super comfortable. Bathroom comes with everything you basically need. I didn't or have to use the products I brought from home. Overall I like them. They weren't the cheapest or the most expensive ones. But I'm glad I chose them. I came as a referral by Expedia.com and will share my review as well there.,positive
"Nice big room; modern/new. Pool, gym, hot tub. Free food and drinks every evening: 5:30-7:00. This was kind of incredible - salad, pasta, hot dogs, nachos, free soda, tea, 2 free alcoholic drinks. Saved us quite a bit of money as the three of us didn't feel the need to eat out afterwards. Haven't had the breakfast yet but am assuming it will be pretty good. Close to Carowinds - 10 minute drive maybe.",positive
"Perfect! This hotel is amazing. After a nightmare at another hotel, we found this gem. It's pristine, comfortably appointed and has the BEST staff! They found out it was my birthday and went out of their way to improve my dismal day. They were absolutely amazing and I can't say enough good things about them. Do yourself a favor, stay here when in Charlotte. Uber is convenient from this location. There's a Ruby Tuesday next door but we didn't eat there. We brought our two dogs along and paid $25 per night as a pet fee. There's a nice pet area in the back. It's flat in two main areas and offers a trash can for dog waste. It's super clean. The grounds as a whole are well manicured and incredibly clean. The showers are very large, water pressure is excellent too. *Convenient to uptown (downtown) an Uber will cost no more than $14. $9 to restaurants 7 miles away. I love this place, and I'll be back! Thank you for choosing the right people for the right job! You're all amazing and I hope you get the recognition you deserve!",positive
Beautiful brand new hotel! We had the privilege of staying when this location was only open for three days. The staff was friendly and the breakfast in the morning was yummy with plenty of options! Our room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. There is a Ruby Tuesday within walking distance. The only negative was there was a large family staying with kids who were up past midnight. We could hear them talking and screaming and slamming doors. We used a sound machine on our phone and that helped.,positive
"Never stayed at a Drury Inn before. That's gonna change, hospitable employees, free food at night, free hot breakfast, 2 free drinks at bar between 530-7 for all guests. Don't book through hotels.com or booking.com prices don't change and they just pester you with emails falsely advertising 50% off. Great AAA discount almost 30$.",positive
This hotel was a little pricey to me but for what I paid we got the suite and it was worth it! The pool and hot tub were great for the kids. I got two free check in drinks and there is free popcorn in the lobby all day for the kids. Melissa and another gentleman helped me check in and the bartender was also a pleasure. All in all I recommend this hotel.,positive
Another great Drury. May have to make them my permanent travel choice. One of the few places that has a true breakfast. They even have donuts for those of us who start our day with coffee and donuts. The evening get together can be used as a dinner place. Staff was very helpful in helping us locate area businesses. They were more than happy to leave us to ourselves. When I travel I only need clean sheets and not full maid service. Only draw back is there are no local newspapers or USA Todays available.,positive
"Lots of amenities, but lacking in the basics. This hotel is fairly priced, and includes a hot breakfast in the morning and an evening ""kickback"" with a rotating menu. There's also a popcorn machine that's free to access all day and a soda machine for your convenience. Upon checking in, those of us 21+ receive an evening drink card, good for two complimentary adult beverages. Sounds great, right? Now, here are the negatives. The bed is a glorified trampoline. It is very hard and even the slightest move will jar your bed partner. The shower/toilet room is very small, and if you're taller than 5' 5"" then your knees will touch the door while you're using the facilities. The bathtub is very small and the soap dish is the perfect height to hit your head on (if you're my height) or your shoulder on (if you're my husband). Overall, I would say this place is just fine for a quick weekend stay, but anymore than 2 or 3 nights and you should find a different hotel.",negative
"I stayed at this hotel since I was traveling for work, and it had to be the most pleasant hotel stays I've ever been a part of! They greet you every time you come in the door, they check with you before walking out of the door to see if you need anything, and no matter what, if you walk by someone that works there, they greet you and see if you need anything and how things are going! The hotel was very up-to-date and though it's not the biggest hotel out there, it's as big as it needs to be for traffic coming through. If you have ever been curious, go stay there! You won't be disappointed at this Drury Hotel! I didn't pay for this trip, but if I had to next time I will most definitely! I was shocked at how low the rates are for what you get!",positive
"I would highly recommend this hotel. Free wifi, free hot breakfast, good location but what differentiates this Drury from several others in Charlotte is the extremely friendly staff. Very attentive and accommodating especially the manager. I usually stay at the Northlake Drury but now I am staying at University location. I feel like they went the extra mile for me.",positive
"Clean room and comfy beds! Staff were super friendly and rates are very reasonable. They allowed my three dogs for $15! Hotel is very clean and didn't have a funky smell like most pet friendly places. Breakfast had large variety of items (hot cooked oatmeal, waffle station, yogurt, bagels, donuts, pastry, yummy buttery scrambled eggs and to-die-for fresh biscuits and gravy). Will def be back if we ever come up this way again!",positive
It's a nice place to stay. It's clean and a friendly staff. Complimentary food and drinks if you want to partake. Places to eat within walking distance too.,positive
I can't wait till next month till my birthday I love the Drury and Free food and drinks I'm legally to get alcoholic beverages,positive
"We will be staying here again! Katie, the check in employee, was very friendly and helpful. They gave us an anniversary goodie bag at our departure. Great breakfast!",positive
"First time I've stayed here and it was amazing! Great, friendly staff that went out of their way to make us comfortable. Free drinks at Kickback Hour and good full service breakfast. Will definitely be back!",positive
"I just wanted to start this review off by telling you all that the Drury Inn's have been the best hotels I have ever been to (I have been to their hotels three separate times). So yes, after the third perfect stay with this hotel chain, I had to write a five star review to show everyone how truly amazing this company is. When we arrived with our family of six, our original rooms were not adjoining. They saw our facial expressions when they broke the news and immediately got to work on fixing it. We ended up with adjoining rooms thanks to the kind people behind the desk! There was a great pool area (indoor/outdoor meaning that half the pool is indoor and the other half is outdoor!) that included a hot tub as well as tables and chairs. The rooms were clean and spacious, with a full body mirror, closet, desk, chair, TV, dresser, nightstand and obviously bed (we had two but it depends on which room you have). The bathrooms were spotless and had plenty of towels and soaps! There is also a free breakfast buffet in the morning that is absolutely wonderful! BONUS: Until 10:00 PM there are free popcorn and soda machines to snack on :)",positive
"The room is clean, the bed is comfortable, the hotel is quiet. I like that the bath/shower is separate from the sink. They offer free wi-fi, free breakfast, free long distance, and free happy hour drinks from 5:30-7pm. The room has many charging outlets. Good quality TV. Overall, a nice room for a good price. My one complaint is that the ""heater"" blows cold air when you turn the heat on, so it is better to just have it off or you make the room colder instead of warmer, which is not what you want in January.",positive
"Free soda, free popcorn, free breakfast. Complimentary everything!!!! Service people are all very nice! scored a Priceline deal and honestly one of the best hotel chains I've stayed at for the price. No complaints considering it was everything I needed and under my budget. Jacuzzi and Pool were nice also and the room was clean",positive
Highly recommended hotel for the $80-$120/night price point. The staff is very friendly and always have a great attitude. They offer a great free breakfast and two free drinks for happy hour. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again.,positive
I have stayed at the Drury for work somewhere probably north of 100 nights! The staff are amazing! For the money you can't beat it at all! I have accumulated a lot of points and now I can use them when I take my family on vacation to Disney!!!,positive
"Stayed here for one night last night. I have absolutely no complaints. Very clean, good breakfast and nice staff. Probably the best hotel I've been to in this price range.",positive
"Booked this hotel from the reviews I read. The hotel is pretty outdated...but makes up for it in the hotel staff. My flight from Ca was delayed twice and I did not end up getting in to Charlotte till 2am. When I first got there an older gentleman greeted me and immediately made me feel extremely welcome. He checked me in quickly, gave the quick run down on all the hotel amenities and even offered me some warm pop corn and said I could get some soda from the beverage machine in the dining room. I had room 303 which was super clean and comfortable. The next morning with very little sleep I was starving so I headed down to the complementary breakfast. The small buffet had scrambled eggs, sausage patties, home frys, biscuits & gravy, bagels, oatmeal, yogurt and you could make homemade waffles. They also offered coffee & juice plus soda if you want. I personally did not care for it and that was only morning I ate there. It wasn't cause the food was bad... I don't eat eggs, sausage or oatmeal....it is a texture thing. I much prefer the freshness of Embassy Suites breakfast. Again it is just a preference thing. Later that afternoon was the evening reception. Each adult is issued a card where they can order 2 alcohol drinks for free. I don't drink alcohol so I can't really say what the offered...however I did see wine and beer on tap. They also offer a hot buffet..most nights it was pasta, meatballs, baked potatoes, chili, another soup of the day, a very very tiny salad bar, hot dog and nacho bar plus the soda and pop corn. During the first nights buffet a HUGE group of teenage rugby playing boys all came with their chaperons to the hotel...later that evening around 10:45 pm they were all still downstairs in the lobby / atrium doing rugby moves jumping over furniture and being as loud as if they were at an outdoor concert. To heighten the craziness the hotel does allow dogs and my neighbor had a small dog that they had left in the hotel room for most of the day and almost all of the evening. when a small dog is lonely he barks a LOT... Because of these two issues I went down stairs the next morning and went to speak with the lady [Amy] at the front desk. Amy was EXTREMELY apologetic..Poor thing I was like the 6th person to talk to her about the issue. she changed my room, she also discounted my bill which would have been fine just those two things however 10 minutes later there was a knock on my new room door and it was Amy holding a bag with a handwritten note. In the bag was 2 bottle of water, fruit snacks, cheese and crackers, candy bars and a bag of trail mix, Talk about going above and beyond, you never see that anymore. The rest of my stay was very quite....I am now a lifetime customer Drury hotel chain.",positive
Excellent stay...pet friendly clean hotel. Comp Breakfast a great way to get your day started. Comp lite fare and drinks in the evening are a great way to end your day. Staff is helpful courteous and friendly. Will definitely be back.,positive
"We stayed here for our nephew high school graduation for two nights. Great customer service, clean room, pet friendly. Free breakfast but was same menu daily. It would be nice if they mixed it up breakfast menu. This is why I gave them four stars. Also had difficulty finding somewhere to walk my two dogs.",positive
"They are pet friendly (with a small fee), give various discounts and give so many free perks! This is the only hotel that offers free hot breakfast that is not only delish but you dont have to be up at the crack of dawn to enjoy. Dinner is also free and yummy did I mention they offer free drinks? YUP they do! Room was nice and clean and pool and spa were a delight for this weary traveler (this review is for Marion IL AND Charlotte NC THIS PLACE ROCKS EVERYWHERE :)",positive
"Very friendly service; freebies galore: Internet, parking, breakfast, dinner, 2 drinks per night. Nice indoor/outdoor pool with swim-under divider and cozy jacuzzi. Easy access in and out. Love it!",positive
"Excellent hotel! My husband and i stayed here for the Coca Cola 600 2014 and it was very nice. Employees are great and very helpful, the guest were great also, very nice people in Charlotte, NC. Would stay again for sure.",positive
"OK so a Drury Inn isn't a Hilton or Marriott, but you're not paying the same rack rate. This hotel was clean and furniture looked pretty new. Staff was very friendly (or maybe it's just the South) and helpful--the manager helped clear garbage cans from the breakfast area. They offer a couple of free happy hour drinks, which I alas was unable to partake of as I was out and about at that time. Room was clean and TV worked. They have a popcorn machine in the dining area so the hallways smell of popcorn. Kind of odd but also kind of pleasant.",positive
"Every employee greeted us happily and sincerely. KUDOS Rooms were comfortable, clean, and updated. Breakfast buffet options were thorough and well done for a hotel/inn! Sorry to have missed the awesome Managers Reception both nights. We were caught up in local awesomeness. Yes we heard the elevator motor and doors shutting, but the pro's outweigh the con's for sure, and really... best digs in the neighborhood. We'll be back~ And ""Thank You"" to all the staff who made our stay wonderful.",positive
"Stayed here for a week. The staff were exceptionally friendly. They had the best free hot breakfast I've ever had at a hotel. The free happy hour was good too. The room was nice and clean, had free wifi, and a great rate of $69/night.",positive
"Stayed here after a KISS concert at the Verizon Ampitheater. Super close to the venue, got a great rate ($75). Great if you are looking for a no frills place that is still comfy, but doesn't look like you landed in Skid Row. We missed the free Happy Hour, but that's a good perk as well. Room was very nice, clean, and the soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispenser in the shower was pretty cool. Would stay again!",positive
We stayed here after a long flight back from Aruba and had wanted a nicer hotel to stay at. We chose the Drury due to the reviews we saw about the 'added' perks. The popcorn/soda and movies they show in the evenings as well as 'happy hour' with free drinks & food. We came too late to enjoy some of those perks but it was a nice stay overall. The rooms were decent with free wifi. The breakfast was above average and was very crowded. There was a huge line (unsure if we had a few groups staying there or what). Would recommend.,positive
"Scottsdale has been waiting for these guys for a long time! Drivers are friendly, vehicles are clean, and you can't beat those heated seats!",positive
This is the best way to go out with friends! So much fun and great service! The driver knew all the best places to take us. With the covered rain fly and heated seats it was plenty warm for New Years!,positive
Riding a tuk-tuk was a great way to get around town and not have the hassles of parking and getting directions. Our driver was super friendly and knowledgeable. Very impressive service and an all around great experience!,positive
"E-Tuk is by far the best way to get around Old Town Scottsdale. The Tuks are clean, comfortable, and the best part...they have heated seats! Our driver was friendly and professional and pulled up right on time as we were walking out of the bar. I will definitely ride E-Tuk the next time I'm in Old Town!",positive
"A much different type of endpoint transportation. The tuk tuks are the nicest thing on the road when you need to get around old town Scottsdale. Heated seats, audio, and all around a fun experience for a cheap price. They take card too, so no need to dig for cash!",positive
Thomas was our driver and was a total sweetheart. He was so friendly and really interactive which made the ride so enjoyable. I recommend ETUKAZ services 100%,positive
"I should have read these reviews before booking here. Booked through hotwire. It takes forever to get to this location and is not worth the cost savings. Once I finally got to the location, I was harassed by the man at the counter about not having my insurance card on me, which is not normal practice. I've been traveling for work and personally for over 20 years and never have been asked that before. The Indian man at the counter was extremely rude and pushy about the insurance. When I told him I didn't have it on me, he insisted that I needed to buy insurance from them. When I told him that I wasn't going to and wanted to cancel the reservation, only then did he tell me that I didn't need to buy the insurance. At that point, I was already dissatisfied with the service I had received and chose to cancel my reservation. When I asked him if he had run my card, he said no, but of course I got home and found charges on my card from them. I instead went back to the airport via an Uber and rented from National car rental, which was 100% better experience. Do not waste your time at EZ! Worst customer service ever!",negative
"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE (or EZ, Fox, NU, or Transcanada)! The price may be tempting but it is only because they will find a way to make that money off of you in other ways! First they will try to hard sell & threaten you into purchasing insurance...way beyond the normal song & dace you get at other more reputable car rental companies. Then if you still decline they will find the smallest smudge on the side mirror to charge your insurance for!! These people are the biggest sleezballs! This must be why they have several business names...Fox, NU, Transcanada, & E-Z Rental car are all the same despicable people at the same address. They are trying to out run their bad name & reviews! Save yourself the trouble and go with a more reputable company!",negative
Talk about a waste of time!!! Avoid this company like the plague. My car was fine but man oh man do they give you the run around. Shuttle is not frequent. In fact after drop off there were tons of people waiting for the shuttle to terminal - I took an Uber. The try and get you to sit and wait when you want to take your car and go. You have to be pushy just to get served. The want copies of your personal car insurance card or they push extra insurance on you. On return they asked me to wait in a long line of 10 people so I gave them the keys and walked out. Pay a little more and avoid at all costs,negative
"Don't be fooled by the cheaper quote found online. Their rental policy does not include liability ($12 per day), whereas most other car rental in Ontario already includes. Commute to the rental office from airport is very inconvenient. Prepare to spent $25 one way if take taxi. Wish to give zero star.",negative
"Location is off airport, requires a train to the Viscount station, then shuttle pick up, takes an extra hour just to get there. Once arriving, the price was increased by forcing to get extra insurance even though card covers collision, which is an extra $15 a day. The price ended up being more than the other car renal companies. Don't waste your time coming all the way out here! The car itself was decent.",negative
"This is probably the worst car rental experience of my life. A staff of people who dont give a damm! They have ONLY ONE airport shuttle for both the hotel and car rental, we waited almost 30 minutes for the shuttle which is only a 12 seater and there were over 16 persons in the que with ongoing arrivals.. Even the shuttle driver was alteady upset with the situatuon cause he had to deal with folks worried about missing flights.. Yea this is thanksgiving day but not an excuse for not being able to shuttle passengers in a timely manner. Also they had no queuing system so people waiting the longest wete at risk of missing the shuttle ride once it filled up!!! Bottom line this company couldn t care less .. Renter beware, the cheap price is not worth the hassle ..",negative
"I would totally give 0 star if I could! Never rent with them! You wont be getting your car even though you reserved the car. The customer service was horrible and unacceptable! They are extremely rude and will never apologize for their fault! Awful experience! Their price is cheap, so is their service!",negative
"I would gladly give this place 0 stars if I could. The employees are rude, slow, lack any sort of happiness, and couldn't even try to act like they cared to help us. After receiving our car soaking wet I asked them for a towel so I could dry the windows SO I COULD SEE OUT OF THEM TO DRIVE and was told they don't have towels, they don't dry their cars and if I wanted a dry car I needed ""to sit and wait for it to dry"" like everyone else. Oh, and this was after waiting for 45 minutes for them to process my info. If you have a chance to go to any other car rental place, do it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!",negative
A complete scam and trap! I wasn't even going to go through the pain of trying to get my money back from a company that forces you to take their insurance to rent any car . I have full collision and liability through USAA but they will tell you that your liability doesn't cover Canada for $3 million dollars if you are American. I needed the car so I wasn't going to haggle any longer for $12 a day from Shawn so I paid it. Every other person in line was being hassled and made to feel miserable! These crooks should be shut down. In addition it's off airport parking and their shuttle was 30 minutes late from viscount station. In addition they had no gas in my car and mismarked it was 1/4 full when it wasn't and the guy who checked me in marked me down returning with 1/8 full. Ultimately I wasn't charged for that. Total price $141 Canadian for 2 days! The name ez rental car is far from ez. They should be called Pilfering rent a car because they trap you with a low price on Orbitz and Priceline and Rob you! If this helps anybody have a better car experience with another company I will be happy!,negative
"If it was possible to give no stars I would! This place is not at the air port you have to call them get a ride to there place, that takes about 10-20mins, then when you get to the place you wait in line where 1 person is doing the work for cars the other is doing the Hotel there. Let just say we got to the airport around 4pm and didn't get our car until 7pm! Never and I mean never using them again! Oh and they try to over charge us and the cars gas was not full!?",negative
"This place is horrible. I've rented here a three times over the past few years, and my parents have as well...we will never, ever, rent from this place again. It's enticing because they are cheaper than any other option, but they have awful service, it takes hours to get your car, it's hard to get to, it's hard to get back to the airport, and they once tried to charge my dad for a dent that was there when he rented the car, and had proof in a photo, but they still tried to charge him, like $2,000, to get it fixed. He missed his flight as a result. This place is shady. Stay away.",negative
"This car rental place should be avoided at all cost! It is NOT at the airport so it will take an extra 1/2 hour to get to the place (with their shuttle) We had a car reserved for 10:30am - they didn't have any cars available and we had to sit and wait until someone bring their car back... we got a car close to 1Pm!! There's no separate efficient check out process - you have to stand in the same line as the people that rent, so plan on extra 1/2 hour just to return the car. They will try to charge you from the time of reservation (not the time you actually got the car) so make sure you pay attention to that. When I complained about how long it took to rent the car on the pick up date I was told ""you are lucky to even get a car""! what??? Who says that...? Pay a little extra and avoid the extra headache",negative
"The customer service was awful! We were forced to buy insurance since the agent stated it was Canada law for all international drivers. Then he said we could pick $11 a day; however we had to pay $12 plus another $30 for insurance. On Expedia I was quoted $195 with taxes and fees; however my final bill was $469.91 for 4 days. The agent did not explain anything to us when he went over the charges, just told my husband to sign - he was rude and racist!!! That night, when people were leaving, they were upset since they have hidden fees. Please do not rent from this company!!! When we even tried to talk to them when returning the car, the agent would not even go over the charges with us stating please deal with my manager knowing that we will be in the US. They make their money ripping off tourists by their false advertisement. I do not know if Canada has BBB, but they do not to be reported.",negative
"Terrible service, wouldn't let me rent a car without paying for insurance, despite having incredible coverage through my visa.",negative
"We didn't have any issues renting our car from them! It was fairly simple and easy. The place is NOT on Airport grounds, so you have to take a Free link train to where the shuttles going to the different off site car rental places wait. We were lucky because the shuttle was already there so we hopped right on and were there in 10 minutes. The car itself was what we ordered and the lady up front was friendly to us. I did see some issues other customers were having while we were there but since it was not my experience I won't write about it. This location is also 24 hours so returning and picking up the car at wee hours of the night is easy and the shuttles run all night. I can see the wait being long if the shuttle isn't already there when you get there and it's super early morning, but you call them when you arrive and they send it over... which can take 20 minutes, but at least you get a free shuttle!",positive
"Never again! Told me I was going to have to pay for insurance. I always just sign a waiver as my insurance covers me for rental cars. I had to go over this again and again. I even had to call my Insurance company in the U.S., they couldn't believe what they were requesting. Then they tried to make me pay a $20/fee for travel to U.S. Total Bull**** I heard the next customer going through the same while I waited for my car.",negative
Stay away!!!!!! What a rip off. Wish I would read these reviews before booking my rental. First of all it was confusing as hell where to pick up the car. The fact you have to find some phone in a magical spot and dial 1 to have a shuttle pick you up and drive you to the office was beyond confusing. When I called I was put on hold indefinitely so I finally just gave up. I ended up just renting a car at the airport for a very reasonable price. I HIGHLY recommend just renting at the airport and it will make your life a lot easier. I may have spent an extra $30 (US money) extra but it was well worth it.,negative
"-5 stars! Don't do it! It doesn't matter if they're cheaper, the headache is far worse! The gripes... Took a full hour to get shuttle from Viscount Station (no, it's not on-site at Pearson Int'l Airport) I called 4 times. They even told us the driver came and went not having seen us standing out in the December cold. BS! Shuttle driver made no effort to load out suitcases or open the door to the van once it finally arrived. At this point I was irritated, but it was close to holidays so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. They did not have the minivan I reserved. ""What's the point of making a reservation if you don't have what I need?"" I asked. You can come back tomorrow and get the minivan, they said. Today you can have a car. My hotel is 18 miles from the airport. Not exactly convenient! But I proceed... We arrive at the rental office (which we could have walked to during that hour wait, by the way) and they are friendly. They'll see what they can do for us. There is hope! They need a knuckle-buster imprint of our credit card (what, why?!?!) and as it's a newer chip-enabled card and has no raised number, ours is rejected. Pretty sure in the US the knuckle-busters are illegal, but whatever. Blame Canada! Final straw...we denied their insurance coverage because the full coverage we have at home covers rental cars. We didn't bring proof of Insurance policy, so they say we must buy theirs. Nope. That's too many red flags! We ended up renting from a well-known brand of car rental and none of this SHENANIGANS happened, but we did have to pay double since we had no advance registration like we did with the terrible EZ car rental of Toronto! JUST DON'T DO IT",negative
"SCAMERS! Avoid at all cost. They bait and switch. Advertise a very cheap price, then force you to buy the insurance and upsell (advertise at $14 a day but i paid $50 a day). You end up paying the same or more than the reputable firms.... Believe me, I ignored the reviews and paid the price. Other than the deceiving practices, if you happen to extend a day, the price of the car will go from $14 advertise to $80!!!!!!!!!! That;s how they get you. Avoid at all cost, pay the extra few bucks and get the safety! I want to figure a way to report them to the BBB",negative
"Wish there was a zero star review option for this company. I'm literally standing in line as I write this they're so terrible. It's a bait and switch operation 100%. Ordered car online, then found out it's an hour to get there, the driver crashed into another car, the nickel and dimed us at checkout, they didn't disclose that there's a $500 deposit per day fee and if you don't pay by platinum credit card that they force you to pay for almost $50 of insurance on top of that. Worst car rental company on the planet.",negative
"ZERO stars. This place is a joke. Absolute worst service and expect to get screwed. That is their MO. They should have their business license revoked. They tried to charge me 20 cents per kilometer even though the rental agreement clearly states ""unlimited mileage,"" but then referred to the disclaimer citing there may be regional exceptions as their out. I have rented cars hundred of times for both business and leisure and have NEVER heard anything so absurd. After asking for a better explanation, the agent who obviously could have cared less about any of the customers he was helping, told me to go ahead and call another rental company if I didn't want to pay. Uh ok? Gladly took my $400 elsewhere. So should everyone else.",negative
"Note: you need to take a shuttle to get to rent a car office. Additionally, they add an insurance surge charge which is atypical for most other car rental services. Would not be using this service in the future.",negative
"Biggest inconvenience of our trip to Toronto. The representative was disturbingly rude and unprofessional and tried upsaling us insurance we already had on top of additional features. In the end, we were forced to purchase a GPS system for an extra $12/day because the GPS in our rental car was purposely disabled. All in all, DO NOT GO HERE. STAY AWAY",negative
"This place is the most horrendous car rental enterprise out there. The way they conduct business is disgusting. They run on a model that can only be described as: the customer is always wrong. Those who are there to guide are rude, disrespectful and dishonest. The estimated online prices are so incredibly low compared to what is actually charged. I would prefer to walk my way through Ontario than rent from this company and I am extremely out of shape. RENTER BEWARE: They charge an absurd amount/ day for insurance which almost doubles the online ""estimated cost.""",negative
"E-Z Rent-A-Car Car Rental 6465 Airport Road Mississauga, ON L4V 1E4 Canada We had booked this car rental via expedia. There is a reason they have one star rating on yelp!!! Here's why: 1. They don't mention (maybe in fine print) that the car rental is NOT at the airport! You actual have to take a tram, take the elevator down to first floor and then call them from a courtesy phone. 2. Once you call them, there is an endless loop of music and ""can you please hold"" and they place you on hold before you can even answer them. Good luck getting someone on the phone! 3. Once you tell them you are at the airport waiting, they will send a shuttle out to pick you up...wait, wait, wait..... 4. Once the shuttle comes, the driver will not help you with luggage. 5. Once you reach the car rental place, there is more wait and there is enormous upsell and the employee do not really care about you, knowing you really have no choice at that point, there are no other option left..considering you are coming from the airport wo transportation and there are no other car rental place you can turn to! 6. Employees are apathetic, not helpful, infact rude. It's just not worth the money you save...trust me. STAY AWAY !!!",negative
"0 star, avoid this place at all cost! Long story short, arrived to the airport at 8:30pm, take the tram to another building since they are off airport, call them with a phone booth provided by the building, waited 10 minutes, shuttle showed up driver refused to take us in, I asked why?? Driver keep saying "" are you economy?? No? No? Can't not!!"" He left my family confused, call the office, press multiple extension# to finally get to talk to someone, waited another 25 minutes for the shuttle. Took approximately 10 minutes to get to their office, sit around for a while since there no one at the counter, a guy shows up at counter, give him all of ours reservations info. We initially booked a 7 seats car two months ahead, guy said no more 7 seats, offer us a sedan ( we are a 4 adults and 1 kid group). We refused to take it since we paid extra for the 7 seats plus we have a reservation, he then offered us a 5 passengers SUV but he needs to call to see if it's available?! To top it off he told us we don't need a 7 seats because we fit in a smaller car. What a joke! After we get the Suv we were told we need to pay $12/day for the insurance regardless of what we already paid online, we were too tired of all the bs and since it's already late, we went ahead and took the car and pay extra money for what they nagging for.

"Trans Canada rental NOT E-Z rent-a-car I booked a last minute rental from this company for one week because the original company I rent from (Zoom, they're amazing) was out of cars. I ended up paying $40 extra for the rental. From the time of pick up I knew I wouldn't be renting from them again. I went in to pick up the car and the rep at the counter seemed unorganized and untrained. As usual, he requested my license and credit card to start processing the booking. I provided both. He then turned around to do some thing and turned back to me asking for my credit card... I told him I already gave him both and he asked me if I was sure. I'm a regular renter so I already know the process and as soon as I reach the counter I take out both to hand it off. He was adamant that I didn't give him my card and proceeded to search the desk. After about 5 minutes he finally found my credit card. I went out with another man to check the car and it was filthy. INSIDE. There were two scratches on the car and the gas tank was at one tick under half. He almost didn't mark the scratches and marked the gas down as half. Since I had to rush to work I couldn't be bothered to mention it. I sure as hell should have. Upon returning the car there was NOONE at the counter so this time I had to wait for someone to be called to come back to the counter (8 mins, I had messaged my boyfriend when I went in and when the rep came so I know the length of time). He came in lazily, I asked him for the total and while looking at the screen he said he would tell me shortly. He went to check the car and came back in to tell me it's under half, one tick. I told him that was exactly how I received it but that's ok and asked what the charge was. Again he didn't know. Few more minutes passed, the gas was $6.62 and I was given my total $180.62, $20 more than what I had booked it at. Let's just say I will NEVER book with this company again. They're unorganized, inefficient, the cars are dirty they will tell you that you're getting more than you really are and the employees seem lackadaisical. Good luck!",negative
"Also known as Payless and Trans-Canada, it's a complete rip-off. I booked a compact car for pick up at the Toronto airport using the car rentals.com website. The trouble started at the airport pickup. Altho the office is less than 10 minutes away, we had to wait more than half an hour for the shuttle bus to arrive. Once at the cheesy office located in a strip mall, there were just two staff to take care of the more than 20 customers. In addition, each customer seemed to be very unhappy with what they were being told, such as the car they'd booked suddenly wasn't available. I stood in line for 40 minutes. Once I finally reached the counter, I was told my car would be ready in 10-15 minutes. In fact, it took more than an hour. It became obvious that the company just didn't have the cars. The customers were livid. All in all, it took more than two hours to pick up my car. When I finally did get my car, I was literally rushed out, without time to check out the car's controls. Turns out that there was no odometer on the dashboard panel, something I desperately needed as I was going to a cottage for the first time, and the directions were all given in kilometers. When I returned the car 3 days later, I was again given the bum's rush and told that they would email me my receipt. They never did. But they deducted $50 more from my credit card than the quoted price. When I called asking for an explanation, I was told the manager would call me back. He never did. This place should be shut down by the authorities. By the way, when I complained to car rentals.com, they replied that this transaction was between me and E-Z, and they had nothing to do with it. So, don't book through them either if you expect any customer service or accountability.",negative
"I would give this a place a NEGATIVE number of stars if I could! Don't be fooled by the low rental rate. I printed out the rules and restrictions that outlined insurance $8.95/day for liability if you don't have proof of your own insurance. Surprisingly today when I checked again at their rules and restrictions, the wording has changed! They insisted on charging me $38.90/day and wouldn't show me the insurance policy to prove what it covers. The estimate receipt was pretty much blank and they made me sign everywhere (giving me the wrong explanation) Apparently what they explained to me about being reimbursed for the coverage was incorrect also. They are also now claiming the tank was empty! What kind of ridiculous story is that when the person checked when I returned the car? Expedia finally got them to email me a copy of the receipt which they did not give me when I returned the car. All the acronyms make no sense. There is no legend to explain what it is. There is also another charge MTFC for $0.80/day...the Expedia rep said that is a donation to help children! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I always donate to causes, but you can NOT force someone to pay for it without letting them know! On top of all this mess, the car smelled of smoke and had a cigarette burn in the back seat. I am almost sure that they are going to try to pin that on me too on top of the now empty gas tank! BTW I have 3 witnesses and the cameras at the gas station to prove I filled up before brining it back. This was the worst experience EVER! Being overcharged by nearly $170 then being accused of bringing it back empty is NOT OKAY!",negative
"I was looking for an affordable car rental for my trip to Toronto. This is an off-site location, a shuttle will pick you up. No problem for me, I've done that before. Now, to begin the many, many reasons why I gave this a 1 star: 1. When you arrive to the location, you may be lucky enough to find someone at the counter. It seems like the employees are running around all over the place. 2. When someone does greet you, be prepared for hassling of insurance. I didn't mind that they had to confirm I was under my parents plan, no problem. Then came for the rental car insurance part. I was told that my AMX Costco card doesn't qualify for rental car insurance. That's odd, never before was I told that. So I had to call AMX and confirm to the employee, this delayed me by 30 minutes. Shouldn't the business know which cards qualify? 3. The gas was half filled, so I was told to return it half-filled. Very inconvenient. 4. The car was dirty inside. (As I was waiting for a shuttle back to YYZ, I saw them hand off my car to another patron, so my assumption that they don't clean cars was on point.) 5. Extra charges to go out of the country. If you do, be prepared to have mileage cut. 6. When I returned the car I sat on the couch waiting for the next shuttle back to the airport. After 30 minutes, I was told by the shuttle driver that they do not shuttle people back to YYZ. He told me he would make an exception for me. He brought around a car, it was just me and him. He was asking lots of personal questions and as I suspected he ended up asking me for my number and coffee for when I come back to the area. The whole experience was flat out creepy.",negative
"I have been renting cars from this location for over 4 years. Things were great until recently. The Staff is Rude, un professional. The Manager Brett is a joke, he should be terminated for his lack of customer service skills, unless you are a white business man in a suite renting a high end vehicle, Brett shows much professionalism with this type of customer. The entire Staff at this location is a joke now. They told my sister that her debit card was not valid and she could not rent a car, she explained to Brett the Manager that the card had a balance please run the card again, Brett told her he could not run the card for another 24 hours. Hmmmmm, thats funny, because she was able to rent at another Enterprise location without any problems. I have spent so much money at the Gilbert location over the years. I have rented at the least 20 vehicles, you would think that they would respect Loyal customers and their families. ""NOT""!!! Brett and his current Staff should be terminated!",negative
"Best Enterprise I have been to. I have to rent a car for business at least twice a month and for personal use at least once a quarter. I have rented all over AZ, CA, IL and TX and by far this enterprise is the best I have been to. The whole team there is AMAZING!!!! They have earned my business and any referral I can give them. Shout out to Maverick, Teddy and Brett the manager. Thank you thank you thank you for always taking care of us. It's because of your excellent customer service that we keep coming back!!!!",positive
"Horrible customer service! Rude, ignorant and unprofessional! The guy helping me was half helping me, half on his personal cell phone with his friend planning what they were going to do that night. Super loud and immature too! Never using them ever- no matter where!",negative
"I got into an accident yesterday. My insurance covers a rental for up to a little over a thousand dollars. They sent me to enterprise. And I could not be any happier with the service I got. I got a sweet young lady on the phone who was so genuine and answered every question I had. I needed a ride and she sent Alex to come and get me at work. What a sweet pea! He picked me up at the time I requested and didn't complain one bit! Super friendly! Picked me up in the car I was receiving as my rental and what a beauty. Way more than I expected for sure! They listened to all my stories and let me tell you, I had a very poopy weekend with my car accident. I was very surprised at how they made me feel like I was family. Smiles everywhere! I will be back to this location for all of my rental needs! Please go here! They are all absolutely amazing!",positive
"What started out as somewhat of a disappointment was impressively turned around. It was nice to feel like not only my business but I too was important and valued as a customer. Wes, I apologize for my shortness and thank you for your professionalism as I expressed my frustration. Bret Warne, thank you for being concerned about my overall satisfaction and making things right... I left a happy customer and will return to your location for any of my car rental needs in the future as well as refer you to others :)",positive
My dad was involved in an accident and is already handicap. He can only fit in specific cars ( he needs electric seats and other features in order to be able to get into and out of the car safely. ) Jami was able to get us in the exact car he was getting fixed that way he was comfortable. Thank you to the staff who was kind and went out of the way to be accommodating.,positive
"Pop the hood and check the engine before you leave!! My husband picked up the rental car and drove it approx 20 miles to bring it to me. He's a car guy, so he decided to pop the hood to check out the engine. To our shock and surprise, the engine was loaded with prickly pears and cacti! We couldn't believe it! It was everywhere! Even down in the engine compartments. I called them right away, complained and demanded another car. I asked them if they check under the hood before they rent vehicles and they said not all the time. WHAT?!? Unbelievable. They said they would get back to me, but they never did. I called again and they directed me to the Enterprise on Bell Road, which is near my home. I drove another 20 miles. When I showed them the car, they were shocked too. They informed me that they always check their engines. This could of been a very dangerous situation. So thankful that nothing happened to us in the 40 miles we drove in the car. Hope they tow the car and get it properly cleaned up. Pictures are posted.",negative
We've used this location several times over the years and have always been satisfied. Most recently the customer service from Matt and Daniel were above and beyond anything I expected. Both are great employees who know how to treat their customers. My husband and I will definitely bring our business back and refer others here.,positive
"Horrible customer service ...walked in and no one greets me, waited for 10 min for them to tell me that there was no cars available after I had made a reservation. I asked well why does it show online that there is available and I received a reservation numberand to be told that it's not accurate... Maybe they should consider calling the customer before heading there. Waste of my time!!!",negative
Very professional staff at this Enterprise location. They picked us up and dropped us off in a timely manner! I would highly recommend renting a car from this group of people.,positive
"Just had a horrible experience at this location. I RESERVED a car with a noon pickup time. Walked in around 12:08 and was greeted with a dirty look by the tired grumpy girl behind the counter. A few minutes later another guy walks in and says ""you realize we close at noon, right?"" No. I didn't know that. If you close at noon, why do you have noon pick up times?? So we show him our reservation and he states he doesn't have any cars. Ummmm. But I made a reservation. Isn't that the point of a reservation? Just stupid. Just ridiculous, very poor customer service at this place. Thanks for nothing.",negative
"It's the same problem as the other interprise location!! They're don't put auto registration in the glove compartment! Got a ticket one time and by law, you must have rental registration, Having the rental contract does not matter, and got the ticket but interprise paid for fine, now this location does the same thing, Beware, make sure your REGISTRATION IS IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT or you will get fined even if accident is not your fault, but if you get a ticket, rental company will cover if registration is not in car!!",negative
"There are few business that make me want to just go get their product because if how wonderful they are ... This enterprise location is one of them. I drive a relatively newer car so renting is optional but I love the employees, the manager Jack is always I it! Love the ease of renting and charges are always what they say. And sometimes I'm even upgraded at no charge. Even though they are a busy branch I always get taken care of...picked up and dropped off from home and made to feel like my business matters! Give Jack a raise as well as the other guys!!! Online reservation a always followed up with phone call confirmation!!! Love it!!",positive
"Quick story to explain my extreme pleasure with this location. My gf has to get something from my car in the morning, but forgets to bring my keys back to the house. Running late for work, she jumps in her car and goes. This just so happens to be on the day my parents are visiting and I am to pick them up at the airport. She is at work and I am unable to reach her. I go on a frantic search throughout the house, around my complex and knocking on neighbors' doors hoping someone has seen or picked my keys up. About an hour to go until the flight lands and I'm stuck with a car that I can't use. Do I send a taxi, a shuttle? Then I think Enterprise! ""We'll pick you up."" I frantically make a call, and I am told they can get me in about an hour. I explain my situation and am told not to worry, they'll get me ASAP. 10 minutes! I was shocked at how quickly they came to my rescue. Their service was unbelievable. I was brought back to the office, filled out the necessary paperwork and was out the door within 5 minutes. I get to Sky Harbor's cellphone lot and park as my mother calls to say they have arrived. Timing was immpeccable! I owe a special thanks to the team working the office that day. It was my parents first visit since I moved out west, and the Enterprise team made sure it ran smoothly. Thank you guys over and over again. I'm not sure if I should name names, but I hope you get the raises and bonuses you deserve for going above and beyond.",positive
The service at this location is stellar. I've been renting from this location for many years when I come home to visit. It's much less expensive than the airport and you get personal service from check-in to return. The only glitch on my last visit was the car exterior had a lot of salt/snow on it but it was a 3 level upgrade because the Economy car I had reserved was late getting back. I'll take seat warmers over a shiny exterior any day! Thanks for keeping up with the service!,positive
"Very good service for my day rental. Definitely the cheapest (as far as 1 day rentals go) compared to others, plus they have unlimited miles. Not 5/5 -They do their typical 'purchase insurance' pitch, Im sure plenty of people get suckered into this which can run you $18 and up. Majority if not all personal car insurance carriers cover you if you rent. - SUV I requested they said they had (and would hold) the day before, but day of rental it was gone. So I got stuck with a POS Jeep. For day rentals, this is the best to go with, would rent from again",positive
Terrible. My car gets totaled by distracted driver. Have to go to Enterprise for a rental per his insurance company. 6 employees. Zero cars to rent. Zero . None zip. You have one thing to do . Rent cars. Your business model is flawed,negative
"My car broke down on I-90 whilst heading back home to New York. I was hundreds of miles from any family or friends, so I called a tow truck and stayed the night at the local Holiday Inn. The next morning I was told the damaged part of my vehicle was possibly under warranty through Nissan, so I had the car towed to the nearest Nissan dealership. The guys at Nissan could not approve a loaner car for me since I was heading out of state, but the Nissan dealership where my car is from said if I rent a car they would reimburse me. They called Enterprise for me and they arrived within minutes. I met with Maggie, whom was very friendly and helpful. After figuring out how long I would need the car and whether or not my insurance would cover it, I was in a vehicle and heading home; about ten minutes after being picked up. I arrived home very late, the next morning I discovered that my rental summary said I had to return the vehicle to the same location that I was picked it up at, which was confusing to me since I thought it was understood that I would be leaving the state. Concerned that I would be charged an additional fee, I emailed Maggie about the situation. It turned out there was a misunderstanding, however she quickly fixed it for me. My experience was near flawless, and when I did have an issue it was resolved quickly and painlessly. I was very satisfied with the rental process, the vehicle's performance, and the excellent customer service I recieved. I highly recommend Mentor Enterprise to anyone considering renting a vehicle that values proficiency and professionalism. Thank you again for everything.",positive
"I can't say enough good things about this location. We needed a weekend rental in a hurry and the manager, Mike, helped us get what we wanted and we were in and out in less than 20 minutes. Their customer service is second to none and we now have a new rental agency!",positive
"I've rented a car for work here every week for a year straight now, and if there ever was a problem (typically my own fault), the professional group of well qualified team players at Mentor Enterprise would ALWAYS do what they could to ensure I drove away a happy camper.

What a wonderful customer service staff. You are treated with respect and friendliness. You are greeted cordially. The car we were given was spotless and safe. Thank you for a great experience during a very trying time. We need to rent a car to go to NYC since my Mom had passed. Thank You,positive

"This store doesn't care about customer loyalty. After my father was a renter for 25 years, averaging 20 rentals a year from enterprise they refused to rent to him because of the hoops you go through to pay with a debit card. Hoops he had never gone though. Instead i rent the car (which they refused to put him on) and he takes my car. These managers repeated the same thing over and over. Disregarding his loyalty. As far as the cars go everyone they gave me smelled like smoke. I settled for the least potent smelling car. Our experiences with enterprise is officially over.",negative
"Always call ahead. If you fail to plan, then plan to fail. But despite my planning efforts, Murphy's Law intervenes. I've used this ERAC branch on a couple of occasions when visiting family & friends. There hasn't been any problems in the past, but I may have thrown them a curveball this time. Apparently the local branches don't keep child carseats on hand. Only the airport ERAC carries them. Hmm...inconvenient for getting a rental with a carseat when red eye flight times are outside their normal business hours. Coulda been the champion of the Family Friendly category, but it's nice that they don't charge extra for the carseat. I called the local branch because there was no online comments section to put in a special request. After a couple of ""let me find out and I'll call you back"" promises went by the wayside, I'm almost at my wit's end before our travel date. Third time is the charm with a final phone call that secured a carseat. I said our baby was closer to 50 lbs and definitely not newborn sized. So maybe I exaggerate on weight, but the point was to make sure we didn't get an infant carseat. Guess what we got? I drove from the suburbs to the airport branch to swap out the carseat. A few days later...Great. My rental almost broke down completely after some freaky mechanical issues and serious road vibration. Lucky me, the branch just closed 20 minutes ago on a rainy Saturday and no one is here. I called the 24-hour roadside assistance number on the contract to ask for a replacement car, but I had to emphasize to Call Center Carol that we were closer to Cleveland, and to not send a car from Cincy. Waiting in the rain killed part of my vacation weekend to explore more local stuff. A few hours later the tow truck driver dropped off a car. Moment of ambivalence. I'm grateful that we got a car, but it was crappier than our original rental. Oh well.",negative
"Long story short, a little old lady rammed me and totaled my car and while her insurance company did their thing I had a rental. Enterprise picked me up from Penske Collision and unfortunately Arizona is one of those states where insurance only has to match number of seatbelts, not class of car like in California. Fortunately, Penske gave me some tips to talk myself into an SUV and after a little bit of a wait I got myself a Nissan Rogue. It was nowhere near as nice as my regular car, but it had four wheels and A/C so it would do. Unfortunately, the inside of the car was filthy and smelled really bad. I stopped by an Enterprise closer to home to swap it out and while they didn't have anything at the time, they did offer to clean it but I didn't have time. Fast forward three weeks and insurance was done paying and I was going out of town and had been told I could keep the rental at a rate of$20.49 paying out of pocket (I purchased a new car and it was being shipped). I called this location telling them I was going out of town and planned to return it on the way to the airport and would get a new one Monday when I got back in town at the $20 rate. I was told by the lady on the phone that no rentals were available all weekend or Monday and I would need to keep mine. She said she was unable to change the price in the computer to $20 but would call me back in an hour if there was a problem. So I drove to the airport, paid for parking and flew to LA and of course the next morning get a voicemail from Mo, the manager saying I need to bring it in and exchange it for a compact for the $20 rate otherwise I'd be charged $50 a day. Of course I can't get ahold of him and he doesn't return any of my phone calls. Finally when I'm told he's left for the day I ask that he's called on his cell phone and told to call me. That does the trick and he's much more agreeable and finally lowers the price considering I was told to keep the car. I would have preferred to return it than pay for parking and rental when it's just sitting at the airport. Come Monday I bring it in for a compact and while I do wait a very long time, the employees make it so I can return my new compact later the next day and don't have to refill the gas to make up for the long wait. Mo was there but avoided eye contact. All the employees, aside of Mo, I worked with were exceedingly friendly and knowledgeable. Enterprise is one of the few places left with true customer service.",negative
"I LOVE this Enterprise location! As someone who rents often from Enterprise in various locations. this one in North Tempe is 1 of my top 2 favorites in the US.

You're high level of customer service is appreciated. Thank you! Hypnotist Jeff Bliss",positive
After going back and forth with 2 representatives I talked to the person that works with problems. Enterprise owed me for 4 days overcharge and I was told they would deduct from my credit card and I received my statement and Enterprise gave me credit of$40.0. That's 4days payment. Some book keeping!!!!,negative
Super fast and efficient.. more than knowledgeable and extremely nice. Car broke down in middle if summer in the Arizona heat. They came so wait. I was so grateful we didnt melt. Tyler i believe was his name was super helpful and had amazing customer service. The price was more than fair and i actually got back more money then i was expecting to pay,positive
"Got picked up 45 minutes late, which is no big deal. After arriving they out me in a car and right before I left I was informed my card wasn't swiping.. last month I spent 1400$ on. Rental and 4 months ago another 1000. They wouldn't further help. Wouldn't even give me a ride home .. the employees behind the front desk did work hard to make everything workout so I will give them credit for that and they all had good attitudes, but the manager really did not seem to care about what he said was a ""personal problem""",negative
"I would not recommend going here at all. I returned the car to an male employee with short hair who mid way through my return, answered a call for 5 minutes, and then proceeded to tell me that they don't offer drop off on Saturdays. The customer before me was given a drop off, and while I was waiting for an uber, two more customers were given drop offs as well. The only difference between me and the customers being dropped off was that I am not white. They were obvious about selectively not providing me with service. Will never return.",negative
Reserved a Chevy Tahoe yesterday. Ryan called me 10 minutes before closing at 5:50pm to inform me that the Tahoe was not available for the next day due to recall. When I called back the representative wasn't very helpful at all . Ended up calling another rental car company paying less with better service. KEEP YOUR COMMITMENTS TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!,negative
"What a great experience,finally! In my experience enterprises are always hit or miss, some are horrible And some are great! This location is one of the great ones. I can not tell you how nice it is to not have to argue with the person there who is assisting. I will never know why it has to be so difficult. You either price match or you don't, and you either want the extra coverage or you don't. I shouldn't have to feel like I'm at a used car dealership. Thank you Taylor and Ryan for being so easy to work with, I will definitely only come to this location from now on!",positive
"I went to pick up a vehicle after being in an accident. I was ""helped"" by an employee named Navaro. During the course of the conversation, I realized that the insurance company reserved a car smaller than I needed. Navaro stated the only thing I could do was call insurce to get the reservation changed. I called the insurance company and got the authorization changed only to be told that was the only car available. The car has scratches all over and was missing a hubcap. I then asked if I could get a larger car from another location and was told he would have to call around. I said ok. He then stated it would take until later that afternoon and I could drive back to pick it up a different car if he found one. I live 35 miles from the location. I then asked to speak with a manager and was told with a smirk on his face, I am the manager and so is every other employee in the location. I was treated very poorly by this location and will never use Enterprise. I tried calling another location to get a car that I was approved for and was told in order to find a full size car I would need to call each location and ask. What kind of company are you running?",negative
"Extremely disappointed! Overall attitude of employees at this location was irritating. They act like they're doing you a favor by renting to you. Even after a reservation was made, my mechanic had to call them to pick me up, then I had to wait in line to get my less-than-clean car, when I go in my rental car to leave, an employee looked at me then parked a car right in front of me and walked into the building. I honked and he came out, gave me a bad-ass look then casually moved the car away so I could leave. After a couple of days, the rental car's check-engine light came on so I had to exchange the vehicle at another Enterprise location for a horrible sedan. A month or so later I noticed they charge me $20 for a ""gas charge"" even though I had documentation that I returned the car with more gas in the tank. Enterprise has definitely gone downhill!",negative
"This location is top notch. The two younger guys that have been here every time I come are incredibly nice, professional, and helpful. Always positive attitudes. They really make the experience of renting a car and all stress free and enjoyable. Would come back here again.",positive
"We love this Enterprise! We rented an economy car for 80 bucks for 4 days to take on our vacation to the coast. When we got to this location they had a Jeep Patriot ready for us. It ended up being an awesome upgrade and great on our trip. It wasn't filled up when we got there, but it was ok with us, because we didn't have to fill up when we brought it back. The guys here are super cool and they work quick and efficient. We'll definitely come back to this location every time we rent!",positive
"Can't say enough good things about this group! Bryan and Natalie jumped in to help us rent a car for our son's dream hiking trip after a competing company left us in the lurch. They were friendly, helpful, and dedicated to providing us the best customer service, even in this last minute situation. They saved the day, and helped us send our son on his trip! Kudos to both bryan and Natalie! Awesome experience, awesome company, awesome people!!",positive
"Avoid this place at all costs, seriously slow and has no concept of customer service. Quite honestly the worst 30 mins of my life was spent waiting on my fianc√©s car to be cleaned after we had already rented it. That stuff needs to be done before hand.",negative

"These guys are handling the move to their awesome new location wonderfully! Excellent customer service, efficient check out and return. Prompt help with forgotten item in rental car.",positive
"I rent offsite at Enterprise every year and return it to the airport. This year when i dropped it off they told me there was a $50 ""Drop Fee"" at the airport. Needless to say there was no way i was going to pay that since no one had ever mentioned the fee, I'd never been charged it in the past and the rental itself was only $50 so this was doubling the cost! The airport said I had to work with the location I rented from so i called them same day. The person i rented from wasn't there but I left a message and he called me back the next day. He let me know the fee is correct however, he wanted to make it right and wouldn't charge me this time. That's great news because I never would have rented from Enterprise again if he had not. I appreciate him doing the right thing and calling me back! Will definitely rent from them again, just DONT return it to the airport :)",positive
Brian and his team are extremely friendly. They attend to your concerns and solve them. I love renting cars from this location. Any day!,positive

After being bounced around to 2 different locations, Tyler accommodated my rental and got me on my way! I really appreciated the staff going above and beyond to make sure I could still make it to California to surprise my parents!",positive
"I don't care about the wait time as long as you keep up with those weekend specials! If you expect to be in your car 10 minutes after you arrive, don't come here. But the staff is friendly and the deals can be great. I have had great service except for one bald guy who works there. He treated me as if I was a moron because I am young-ish. Didn't have the heart to tell him that I am a biology PhD student and have rented cars many times for research. Worst customer service rep I have encountered in a while. Enterprise, you can find someone better to replace him with. Otherwise, I dig this place!",negative
"I rented several times from this location. The staff members were always friendly and came to recognize me as a customer over time. I did not have any hassles with getting the right car, pricing, damage, insurance, etc. Wait times were reasonable to none at all on my visits for both pickup/returns and handling the transaction itself. I do recommend avoiding peak times, which seem to be at opening, closing, and lunch. This location can get very busy. Around 10-11am worked very well on my visits as this appears to be a less busy time.",positive
"This place rocks! Jamie (sic?) and Dustin always make me feel at home whenever I rent from them. Although I now live about 10 miles away from THIS Enterprise, I continue to go to this specific one because of their superb customer service. Thank you for being my neighborhood car rental choice!",positive
"I wouldn't normally write a review about renting a car but the customer service at this location was great. I've never had a problem with Enterprise, but this office is always very friendly and a couple times I've gotten a free upgrade. Just nice to have a good experience even when dealing with little stuff like car rental.",positive
I've rented enterprise several times in the past and never had a problem until now. There's a dumb blonde bimbo who works there who kept arguing with me about a rental I had in the past. She had absolutely no clue what she was talking about and totally screwed up my rental. It was so bad that I ended up leaving there and went to the airport and got a rental from enterprise there. DO NOT go to this location as there is a good chance they'll screw up your's also.,negative
"Yuck... Alright I don't complain about much...No really!! Check my posts... it could be construed I am overly positive... That's why this place needed to be reviewed, because I can't be positive about this place. Not even a little... Here is why: So I get into a little fender-bender and I drop my car off to get it fixed by the insurance company. I pick literally the closest place to the shop because well all car rental places are the same eh? Not so my friend... I have never seen a more ghetto, backroom operation in my whole life. So the place is in this non-descript dirty little building in an industrial area in Tempe. That is nothing to bitch about but the dingy little office INSIDE...frankly made me want to take a shower. There is one person doing everything and it took over an hour to be out the door with the car. The car I got was not washed. It smelled like someone smoked in it for weeks with the windows rolled up and left burning cigarettes burning in it while they were sleeping at night. They knew it was through insurance, so I am not sure why they gave me a car that was more than ANY insurance would actually pay leaving me with a bill of over 200 bucks after the insurance. There was a snag with my insurance initially which has nothing to do with them... but I did get a call from them after I turned in the car, asking me to pay again ( after I paid out of pocket) ... apparently there is no office memos or communication in that office. Yeah that's it...but for as something as simple a renting a car they sure managed to make it a spectacular screw-up, and probably the worst experience I have ever really had renting a car. I would certainly look to other places if you are forced to rent in that neighborhood.",negative
This location was good a couple months ago but I've yet been able to rent a car from this branch no matter when I reserve online and what time I come in they never have a car available for me.... a little weird. They told a guy in front of me that no minivans were available then tried to put me in a minivan after he left this location needs more cars or new management,negative
"I've rented from this location several times in the past year and the experience has always been great! The customer service is outstanding, they are quick and efficient and always do a follow up call to make sure I am satisfied. I deal with a few Enterprise locations here in Ohio and in the Chicago area-- this one is way better than all the others! Fast service, clean cars. Thank you, especially to the manager (Mike I believe).",positive
"I've rented from this location for the past two years when I've come home to visit my family, as this is the closest Enterprise location to my mother's house, and I am a dedicated Enterprise customer. I always receive excellent service from Enterprise, which is why I only rent from them, but both years the guys that work here have gone above and beyond to help me out. Mike, one of the managers, adjusted my reservation for me when I decided I needed the car a day later, but didn't change the rental rate, and made a few additional accommodations for me with regard to my return time. He went out of his way to make sure I got the car I wanted when I was lazy and missed my arrival time and they ran out of cars. They were all so friendly and helpful. Service like this is why I keep coming back to Enterprise.",positive
"Enterprise provided a loaner vehicle for my daughter while her car was being repaired. Enterprise had the car waiting at the body shop and we dropped it off there when car was completed. although insurance provided service, we couldn't ask for more convenience and service. We always use Enterprise when we travel.",positive
The car my wife picked up at the repair shop was TERRIBLE. It was dirty and had so little gas that my wife wasn't sure if she would make it to the nearest gas station. Although it had very few miles on it the auto transmission slipped. The windshield was grimy. I rent cars often for business trips. It wont be with Enterprise. Is there a rating less than 1 star???,negative
Employees are nice enough. Office is clean. Would not recommend if you're in a hurry. Asked to leave luggage in office to check out car and told to bring it with me. Got to car and informed it had to be cleaned yet so trudged all the way back and waited. Appreciate cleanliness for sure but kind of annoying when you're pressed for time. Apparently it's a thing at this enterprise. Another couple having to wait for their car to be cleaned as well. Travelled to Florida a week ago and had to rent. Took a total of 5 minutes from walking to the counter to grabbing a clean car and getting off the lot.,negative
"I would give zero stars if possible. Don't waste your time with this place. Took my reservation and when I arrived told me that they could possibly have a car for me the next day. Tried to explain that ""reservations"" are not really reservations but just an expression of interest in possibly renting a car at some time in the future, despite the confirmation email stating that a reservation guarantees a car is available (although not necessary the type you reserved. Stay away!!!",negative
"I scheduled a pickup at 8:30 from a dealership maybe 3 minutes drive time from the Enterprise. At 3:45 I called and someone was there at around 3:52. The car hadn't been washed or vacuumed so it faintly smelled of smoke and was covered in dust, dirt and pollen all the way around. You could see hand prints in it from where the employee closed the door. On the way to the branch (again 3 minutes away by car tops) the employees phone rang and she answered it, not by the cars sync system but manually and sat there until blocking cars behind us u till she was finished with her phone call. Inside the branch they were horribly unprofessional asking with attitude if they ever picked up that 8:30 ( me), laughing about missing other reservations and at an elderly man that called in trying to get picked up. They didn't take me to inspect the car at all just told me to sign and I could go. As someone that used to work for enterprise I know this is not how things are supposed to go. Now I am late for work and have to drive around in a dirty car until mine is repaired. I won't be dealing with this branch in the future if I can help it.",negative
"The check out clerk was more interested in her iPhone than providing customer service and had a terrible attitude. The car we were given had smelled like vomit and had dried vomit all over the gear shift. Fruit had been left to rot in the glove compartment. There was a cleaning checklist hanging from the rear view mirror signed by 2 associates. Not sure what they cleaned, but it wasn't the car; probably their iPhone screens. Edit 5/2/2017 The day I picked up the car, I called the customer service hotline with my concerns. I was told by the representative that I would receive a call from the regional manager. I never received that call; instead I was contacted several days later by the branch manager. I spoke to the branch manager around 2 weeks ago. He was more concerned with the checkout clerk's performance than the biohazard that was left in the car. I was told I would get a partial refund. Well, it's been two weeks and I have not received it. Honestly, not getting a full refund is ridiculous. I took a video of the state of the car right before I called the customer service hotline, and I've attached it below. https://youtu.be/ZVE4jb7vhr",negative
"This particular Enterprise location is top notch. I rent a vehicle about once a month for work and each time the staff helped me figure out which rate was the best deal. Sometimes we opted for the Corporate rate and sometimes it made sense to upgrade to unlimited mileage, no matter which they always helped me do the math to figure it out. All the vehicles I've rented there have been pretty much new, including one that I received with only 13 miles on it!",positive
I really appreciate the great service. Easy pick up and drop off. Good hours of operation - even on the weekends. Nice clean car that performed perfectly. Really appreciated the free parking for my personal car while I was off doing business in their rental car. Thanks guys!,positive
"I have nothing but kind words for this location and their staff. After a huge mix up and issues renting at another branch delaying me over half an hour, Kortney took care of my reservation and provided me with the service that I'd expect from Enterprise. She not only assisted in helping me find their branch, but in the easiest way to get close enough by so that I could be picked up by their branch. My five stars here can't even barely begin to express my gratitude for them and their professionalism. Thank you so much!",positive
"I am indirectly a customer of this dealership because I bought a Vespa Scooter that they sold new. Here are the two issues which I have had so far that are directly the result of dealership not correctly handling the PDI and sale of this scooter. The dealership neglected to register the warranty. I have been working with Piagio USA for weeks to try and get this issue sorted out and the warranty retroactively registered. The bike currently is not starting due to some mechanical issue and my local dealer does not want to touch it because they don't know if there is warranty on it (it is not ""in the system""). It is very negligent of a dealership to not correctly register the warranty for a bike they sell in a timely manor. The scooter has a carburetor. I would suggest that in the US, scooters tend to be vehicles that people ride for recreation and not everyday transportation. The E10 Ethanol blended fuels (found at most fuel pumps) are not good for vehicles like this. Scooters sometimes sit for a month plus and when the E10 fuel sits in the carburetor it turns to gum. The dealer was nice enough to fill the fuel tank during PDI - but was not diligent to find the Premium zero ethanol blended fuel.",negative
I posted a really really nice review about this establishment but now I have to change it. I brought a 2017 Moto Guzzi V7 stone from this dealership and have had nothing but problems. They've had it for 3 weeks now and when I call to get an update I'm placed on hold for over 20 minutes only to be disconnected. I've left several messages for someone in service to call me back and give me an update and that has never happened. The attitude of the associates when you call is very dry and rude unless you tell them you want to buy a bike then they become your best friend. I know that because I called for service and was treated like crap. I turned around and had a friend call like 2 minutes after I hung up and spoke to the same guy and his whole attitude changed when my friend was pretending to be interested in buying a bike. This is the worse place I've ever dealt with as far as customer service goes AFTER you purchase a lemon. I think I may have to get my attorney involved since I've taken my bike back over 8 times for the same freaking problem. I wish I could give zero stars. One star is to many for this place.,negative
Todd and Joe from finance have been awesome. Buying a bike and having it shipped to you could be nerve racking but they've made the process smooth and most importantly they have been very attentive and patient with my 1001 questions and concerns. Thanks!!!,positive
I took my motorcycle to the repair shop months ago. Have had to go out of my way to find out what the status of the bike is. This has been the worst experience with any shop i've had. They really dont care for their customer. If your looking for a storage place for your bike this is your place. If not take your business somewhere else.,negative
"This is the second and only second review I have ever left on Yelp the first one was for the same business where I get absolutely no response or integrity or any type of considerable salesmanship from this company. These people will post the worst motorcycles available for you in there used Craigslist ads that is where I found my Ducati motorcycle that I paid over $11,000 for cash and broke down less than 850 miles. They claim to have service the bike yet cannot provide any service record and the warranty company refuse to honor the warranty as it was sold to me as a trade in when all actuality it was purchased from auction and a race bike converted to Street use for my displeasure. I have dealt with the store manager who is a lead to a long dead-end alley and promised a call back from the owner several times and never received one.",negative
"This place has the worst customers service in any business on the planet. Went there to drop a bike off to get fixed and only 2 people are there which was a salesman and a parts guy. We stood there next to the parts guy while the salesman was playing candy crush on his phone for about 15 minutes. Finally he said that everyone was in a meeting. After another 15 minutes we asked how long the meeting was cause we had things to do thats why we were there early. His reply was the only thing I dont know how to do is writing a service ticket. So he couldnt use common sense and write on a blank piece of paper someones name, address and phone what the problem is and say as soon as they get out of the meeting they will give you a call. Instead he stared at us for the next 30 minutes. Management should have another meeting about that. Teach your morons to take the initative and help the customers out.",negative
"Bought a Harley here. Headlight fell apart a few days after due to faulty wiring. Took it to Harley to fix, told me the way it was wired could have started a fire it was so bad. Recommended I take it back to the dealer to fix the battery because the battery was shot, sure enough the battery died the next day. They replaced it with another shot battery. Wouldn't recommend this place at all.",negative
We rented 2 Bonnevilles from Dave and it was GREAT all around. They were super nice and caring and the bikes were great. Dave went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. Highly recommend this company.,positive
"I made an appointment with John to buy a 2017 Triumph Trophy. I took the title of my current motorcycle and a blank check with me. When I arrived at Euro Cycle John was standing outside the store with another customer. I walked inside to wait. When I walked inside three other sales people were standing (one by the cashier, one in the parts section and the other by store offices. I stood at the entrance and each one of the sales people looked at me, then looked away. I waited. Not one of the sales people said one word to me. (note: I was the only customer in the entire store). I spotted the Triumph Trophy and walked to it. I didn't touch the bike, I just stood next to it staring. The sales manager ""Hollywood"" walked out of the offices, looked at me and kept walking. (Note: I am still the only customer on the showroom floor). John walks in with a customer, looks at me and continued his conversation with the other customer. Now, I go back to the Triumph Trophy get on the bike and start testing the clutch, brake, etc... As of yet not one of the five sales people (to include the sales manager ""Hollywood""), who are in the same room with me, have not acknowledged me in anyway at all. Not even a ""hello, welcome to Euro cycle"" nothing. Ten (long) minutes have passed since I entered the store. John stops talking to his customer, turns to me and says ""you been helped""? Please note: Troy and the other salesman in the Euro cycle store on the other end of the building are outstanding. If you must go to Euro Cycle go see Troy.",negative
"I rented a Triumph Tiger for 5 days from this dealership. The bike performed flawlessly for the entire trip. The bike was ready for me when I arrived early. Everything was explained carefully and the guys at the dealership were very accommodating. Dylllan in particular was very helpful. The whole rental experience was seamless and I would rent from them again in a heart beat. Planning next years trip now, in fact.",positive
Absolutely the worst experience that I have had dealing with.....EVER!!! I walked in with an approval letter and they never called me back which they had promised by Mon. Wednesday came around and no call not to mention they sold the bike that I was interested in. Don't bother with this place if you are serious about buying anything. There is no such thing as customer service or honesty.,negative
"After crashing my bike in the Mojave, I had it towed to Euro Cycle. Their service guys went out of their way to accommodate me and to get me back on the road that same day. I'll always be grateful.",positive
"S.Smith Great place! Coming from NY, they took care of me right away. Will always use them when I come cross country. Thanks Todd",positive
This place is great Dave one of the owners takes care of everybody personally they have a great selection of motorcycles to buy into room with great prices we had a little malfunction on one of the bikes on our ride out for the day everything was fine called up Dave and within 15 minutes he had A brand-new bike out to us and we were riding within 20 minutes from the breakdown I would definitely recommend using this company anytime I'm in Vegas for a trip,positive
"Parts department is not open on Mondays (huh?). Was looking for a USB plug specifically for a Vespa, and they didn't carry it. I expected their parts selection to be better.",negative
"Yesterday I picked up my Street triple R! Mark & Kristina really made the buying process easy and hassle free. I really appreciate Mark the owner going out of his way to speak with me and help me understand the bike I purchased, I've bought bikes from the majority of dealers here in Vegas and never had this kind of service. Kristina god bless her, she made the whole finance portion so easy and was extremely professional and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this dealership, for sure will be back again to buy another bike one day. If your in the market for new motorcycle please do yourself a favor and go see Mark and Kristina before you buy.",positive
"Excellent customer service, despite being an awkward customer with a busy timetable the team at freedom where very patient and helpful with advise and selling me only products they though I would genuinely find useful with my new triumph t120. The bike has been excellent and I am enjoying every journey on it. Thanks Craig and the rest of the team at freedom. Chris",positive
"Awesome people very friendly. I wouldn't be owning a bike right now if they didn't put a good word in for me. I owe them alot for doing this for me and will definitely always remember my experience here. Definitely the friendliest dealer I have been to, and was just so easy going through all of the paperwork. Props to them and definitely stop by here, even just to talk to the guys!",positive
"My dad and I were in Vegas, and decided that we wanted to rent motorcycles, my dad went to get everything ready while I was at an event, and SEAN is the most helpful guy there, he had all the bikes ready for us when we were there, got us some gear and had us on our way in no time at all, on top of that he called us a cab when we were done so we could get back to our hotel, just a great overall experience, and enjoyed it all. Thank you!! Sean is the man.",positive
"We scheduled renting two bikes from Freedom last weekend. Though they were closed, Sean came and met us at the shop to set up the rental. Professional and accommodating, his going above and beyond made my dad's trip out here so much better. To top it off, the bikes were in fantastic shape and ran incredibly. Looking forward to renting from them again and referring them to everyone I can!",positive
"The staff here is genuine and just plain awesome! They really value their customers even after the sale and that says a lot. With the way they treat you, it makes you WANT to do business with them. A year after I purchased my bike, I admit that I was considering selling it. It's still a great bike, it's just that I don't get to ride it too much. But then I call them up about something unrelated and their service made me want to keep the bike out of loyalty, without them even knowing my thoughts of selling it.",positive
"My review is based strictly on several visits to this dealership to drool on the latest and greatest from Triumph. I've not purchased a motorcycle there. However, the staff is incredibly friendly and willing to answer questions respectfully. The owner is usually there and loves to talk bikes. The dealership is spotless clean, very upscale and has a great selection of new and used bikes. Plus, they will let you test ride many of the Triumph bikes. I've taken out a Trophy 1200 and Tiger adventure bike. Both were incredible bikes and at the Trophy is a the top of my list for the next sport-tourer. If you are in the market for a new or used MC, I'd recommend stopping by Freedom. Triumph bikes have come a long way have a cool kind of exclusivity that other brands can't match. Plus, the sound of the triple engines is awesome - kind of a wailing howl that is completely unique.",positive
"Went in an bought a Thruxton 900,Mark and all his staff are super friendly and extremely helpful in answering all my questions overall it was a great experience. I am looking forward to seeing which motorcycle is next, definitely coming back.",positive
Had one of the best motorcycle purchasing experiences ever at Freedom. All the guys and gals are top of their game. A special thank you to Craig...he took the time to help ensure the bike matched where my riding interests (aka getting older) are headed.,positive
"To Sean, Kristina, and Mark: thank you so much for helping me with my upgrade to the Piaggio MP3 400cc. I heart it! Your excellent customer service can only be matched by your unparalleled sincerity. Definitely a pleasurable experience doing business with you. I feel like I made new friends. Y'all are awesome. Already looking forward to my next bike purchase!",positive
Rented a Triumph 1200 Explorer......awesome. Craig was fantastic and this is the ONLY place to rent a motorcycle in Vegas. I only wish I could have stayed a few more days.,positive
"Craig is the man! Awesome experience at this place. Great low pressure dealership. Great knowledge of riding and what bikes fit what style of riding. I came from a Harley Davidson XR1200X and was looking for something a little more powerful and sportier, but not a full on sport bike. I'd read up on a few brands and checked them out as well. My top two were the Triumph Speed Triple and the BMW F800R. I went to both dealerships and it was a no contest. Freedom Cycle gave me a great deal. Worked with me, and they really seem to care after the sale, which is important to me. Very important. Can't say enough about these guys. Thanks again to Craig and the crew at Freedom Cycle. LOVE the bike!",positive
Mark the owner is awesome. I can't say enough about how great my experience with buying my first triumph was. They've got a customer for life!!,positive
"I love coming to this shop! It's got the nicest bikes displayed out on the floor and the staff is amazing! Everyone is so nice there and they always make you feel like they've known you forever. The customer service is more than you can ask for and the shop has so much to look at...I'm in awe every time I walk in there!! If you haven't checked them out, you need to do it the next time you're in the area. We stop by every time we're in Vegas.. it's a must!",positive
If your looking for Triumph or MV Agusta you will know your in the right place when looking around their showroom's. When I was looking to purchase a 675 the timing must have been right because Freedom Cycle was not even open but I still stopped by to see what they had. I found what I was looking for right on the showroom floor. I met and spoke with the owner; in conversation there was no sales pitch but just a down to earth guy who knows his product. With the transaction complete I have never looked back because they take care of me every step of the way. The customer service alone with worth more than the bikes they sell because your not going to find that at Carters or Ride Now. Every upgrade and request I have asked for they accommodated; your always welcome to stop by and will always be greeted. Its easy to say when I have the capability to purchase another bike this is the only place I am going.,positive
"AVOID THIS CAR SERVICE: ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A WOMAN. I called the main # because I couldn't find my car, while waiting in the lobby of my hotel. No driver called me back to find me or confirm, so I called the main number back 15 min later, worried I might miss my flight. When I finally found my driver and went to throw my suitcase in his trunk, he yelled at me and proceeded to argue about not being able to find me. I tried to explain that I'd been trying to reach him by calling the main #, but he continued to blame me for the situation, and the situation escalated quickly. It's surreal to type/share this, but he started yelling at me, called me ""a F*#ing B@$th"" and threatened to ""punch me in the face"" if I didn't get out of his car. It quickly became a verbally abusive situation. After getting away, I called the manager/owner (?) immediately to relay the exchange and he was defensive and asked me what I expected him to do about. How about apologize profusely for a driver that verbally abused a woman and threatened to hit her? What a horrible, irresponsible company. UPDATE-RESPONDING TO THE OWNER'S RESPONSE: I called your company twice while waiting for my pick-up, because I'd gone downstairs to the lobby of my building at 8:45am, when the pick-up was scheduled. I called your company at 8:49am (from my phone log) to try to reach my driver, but I received no call back. I waited and then called back at 8:58am. At this point, I was worried I might miss my flight and I was upset. I've used professional car services for a long time and I've never encountered a company that doesn't give the drivers the passenger's contact number and/or have them call if there's a Miscommunication or they're unable to connect. What is most troubling about your response is that you're taking no accountability for your driver's actions or your company's inappropriate response. Your driver, after calling me a horrible name, THREATENED TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE. He never de-escalated the situation and once he said that, I feared for my physical safety. SO, IN EFFECT, IN YOUR RESPONSE YOU'RE CONTINUING TO BLAME NOT ONLY YOUR CUSTOMER, BUT A WOMAN WHO'D BEEN THREATENED BY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE by your driver. And regarding that first pick up in PITT three days earlier? Your driver showed up late and I had to call you twice to find him. (Flight changes happen. I was delayed out of LAX due to fog. I called you as soon as I knew about every change.) Review stands. Very unprofessional. I'll let Yelp reviewers decide. Final update: The fact that you're continuing to argue with a female customer after YOUR DRIVER THREATENED TO HIT HER just illustrates what a tone-deaf manager and deeply misogynistic person you are. You should be ashamed of yourself. You've been defensive and horrible throughout this entire exchange, as evidenced by your need to continue blaming me. You only apologized the day of the incidence on the phone after I started crying. I was thinking of deleting this whole exchange because I want to put it behind me, but women in Pittsburgh need to know your drivers are potentially dangerous.",negative
"Excellent service! The driver was first class! Truly was the best car service I have ever experienced. Driver was classy, professional and kind. Great reservation service and very fair price. Do yourself a favor-skip the cab and call this car service. Reliable, professional and great value. Thank you!",positive
"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us. We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party. Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??! Why??!! How??!! We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!! He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us! Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. So if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!",negative
"Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!",positive
"FCLS - First Class Limo Service - I""ve used FCLS on many occasions in New Jersey and New York for company corporate travelers. Excellent customer service in every way. Drivers are always on time, courteous and knowledgeable. Cars are clean and in perfect shape. One of the best!",positive
"After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment.",positive
"Ditto everyone else. I had out of towners needing to get to the airport but I had a last minute work conflict and couldn't drive them. I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.",positive
"Great customer service. I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport. I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong. It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.",positive
"I agree with the other reviewers. I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. I'm a grumpy New Englander, and have been frustrated by the small town, easygoing/careless customer service at many PGH businesses. These guys are different: professional, punctual (even in snow!).",positive
"Quick confirmation, on time pick ups, clean cars and professional drivers. We're in NYC - used for an employee who was in Pittsburgh for a meeting. Everything went smoothly.",positive
"This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.",positive
"Don't book here it's a ripoff. Called at least ten times and they're either closed or they just don't return or answer their phone. Bumped their review up to two star from one. They returned our calls and said they were closed during the summer, but really is that good for business. Keep you posted!",negative
"I was thinking that this would be a nice retreat for my wife and myself. I was wrong. I had written to cancel and even though it was more than a month in advance of the reservation they charged full price for the room. I called and left a message a few days later when I noticed the charge on my credit card. There was no answer at the inn and even though I left my name and phone number I never received a call back. I called again and was able to finally get through. The lady on the phone was not nice at all and simply stated that they did not offer any refunds and that basically I was out of luck. I could not recommend that anyone should even consider staying at this location, just the attitude of the people alone is enough to drive any customers away.",negative
"Why? Why stay in the middle of a dead town? Nothing is open around you. All there is to do is so far away you must drive. The food you are served at the bread n breakfast is prepackaged, frozen and tastes terrible. Don't borher",negative
"I can't review the actual inn. My review is based on their customer service. I had to cancel my reservation due to a change in plans. I called three weeks before the reserved date. They apparently have a no refunds policy and strictly enforce it. I was unaware of the policy at the time of booking, but I see other reviewers have had similar experiences. I should have read all the reviews. I do understand that they may feel they need to charge a fee for their inconvenience, but they charge the entire amount of the room for the night. I don't feel this is a fair policy or good customer service. Particularly when given three weeks notice to find another occupant. Very disappointed and out $150. PLEASE MAKE SURE OF YOUR PLANS BEFORE BOOKING!!!",negative
"Not Family Friendly The restroom at Gas Light Inn displays framed photographs of people hardly wearing any clothes, posing in sexually suggestive ways. It is not appropriate for children. It is not appropriate for anyone who prefers to think clean thoughts. I understand not everyone is offended by, or even dislikes sexually suggestive photographs. My review is simply a warning to people who prefer family-friendly environments and to people traveling with children. I also ask management to consider the type of guests they are trying to attract to their establishment when they change the bathroom wall displays.",negative
"This was such a great find! We came to Phoenix for Spring Training and my wife found this place. Clean, comfortable, super friendly staff, delicious cookies every night, hearty breakfast every morning, all included in the price. Kind of a cross between a B&B and a hotel, but not sterile like a hotel and no nosey B&B owners (not that they all are, but it happens!). It was fun to just roam around after hours, hang out in the lobby or the roof top terrace. The AC was awesome (a must in AZ), too. Just kind of felt like home away from home. We plan to stay again next spring! Thanks Teresa!",positive
"We have stayed at many Bed & Breakfast's over the years and this one is by far our favorite! The attention to detail, the top notch service and OMG the breakfast! I will stay here again! Every room has it's own bath. Each room is very nicely appointed. While the historic nature of the place comes through clearly, the steps don't squeak. Teresa is a great hostess and chef. She and husband Peter really work hard to ensure a great stay. Breakfast was really special and delicious. We ate dinner at their new restaurant, the Desert Rose Steakhouse, and it was also fantastic. The OTG Wine Bar also has some unique beers and wines. We will stay here again.",positive
"love staying at the Gas Light Inn, switched from staying at the other hotels close to the stadium. Gaslight Inn is a much better place to stay. Homemade breakfast, clean and comfortable. LOVE IT.",positive
"I would have like to have stayed here - we booked in August for January - but due to a family emergency we had to cancel about 60 days in advance. Their cancellation policy is clear, and it is rigid. You will pay for two nights if you cancel - even if they have literally MONTHS to rebook your room. Because this is essentially all I know of the place first-hand, I was left with the impression that the customer experience at this establishment is so poor that they do not have any confidence they can rebook a room even when they have two months to do so. Otherwise they'd have a much more customer-friendly policy.",negative
"I went to Glendale Glitters last Friday after not having gone in over a decade. Didn't spend much time there but was hungry and wanted some food and a drink. A friend suggested Haus Murphy so we went there. Unfortunately there was a 30-45 minute wait, apparently everyone in Glendale wanted to eat there. Cold and not wanting to go far we back tracked to a place we passed by on the walk. Gaslight Inn. I figured that since its billed as more of a bed and breakfast that fewer people would go there and it didn't have a line out on Glendale. First we were sat next to the stage which I didn't care for since it would have been hard to have a conversation without losing our voices so we asked that they move us. The hostess did and we sat along the west wall. I say this because initially it took a solid 10 minutes to get anyone to notice us or get us a drink. My friend went over to get the attention of our waitress Danielle. She looked around as if someone else was suppose to come over and it was their area. No worries, she came over immediately and apologized. I got some water with some wine and my friend got a ""girlie"" drink. I'm not a fan of them but it actually tastes awesome. It was a chocolate drink in a martini glass. She came back to take our order and informed me they were short staffed that night and she'd be the one taking our order. We each got sandwiches and split a board of bruschetta. We picked three (one with figs, one with salami and one with green apples) and Danielle recommended the one with strawberry. Our food came out very quick and although the sandwich was what I was craving the bruschetta ended up being a hit. Everyone loved their sandwiches but the bruschetta disappeared. I have to say it was the best that I've had and was pleasantly surprised. In addition, my friend got the apple cider martini drink and that was even better that the chocolate one. (I don't remember names of food or drink but refer to stuff by flavor) Even though Danielle was very apologetic, the food and drink made up for the wait at the beginning. Everything was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars because of the wait and having to attract someone's attention. We borderline would have left and would have missed out. I forgot to mention there was live music. This guy was a one man band and played a mean sax. I thought he was playing a recording but it was all him. That was definitely a plus. I believe they have rooms on the second floor of the inn and when I asked they said there were 10, so it would be a good place to go if staying downtown although I don't know the room rate.",positive
"Best Kale salad I have had in ages with pistachios, raise and feta. My husband has the tuna salad panani and the Murphy's Stout. He thoroughly loved them both. Very congenial and helpful waitress. Would definitely eat here again.",positive
"A perfect place to stay during spring training. It's mixes the benefits of a hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast. Rooms are nice, parking close by and restaurants and bar right there. Breakfast is bistro style and cookies/ coffee / scones are available 24/7. This will be our yearly hub during preseason. Theresa treats you like family ( without having to do any chores) A gem",positive
"We discovered this place randomly and are very impressed! This place is quaint, friendly clean and comfortable! On a quiet downtown street with little evening traffic and no outside noises. We went for a late evening walk outside before retiring and found the streets safe and peaceful to walk for for blocks. The breakfast was fabulous. If we ever return to Glendale this will our choice of our place to stay. Thank you Theresa.",positive
Our stay at gaslight was fantastic! The accommodations are not only comfortable but you can tell the owners go above and beyond to make your stay fantastic! I mean come on! All the hallways have fresh baked cookies and keurigs to make yourself some fresh coffee. The restaurant and wine bar attached to the inn has fantastic food and a wide selection of wines. I know I won't stay anywhere else next time I need to visit AZ!,positive
By far the most comfortable bed I have slept in in the last couple years. The food and the service was just spectacular. I booked this room for a work trip not realizing it was a bed and breakfast and it definitely turned my business trip in to a mini vacation.,positive
We very much enjoyed our stay at the Gaslight Inn. The rooms are amazingly big and very well appointed. Breakfast was well done and you are right in the heart of downtown with amazing restaurants and fun shopping. We will stay here again.,positive
"I've had the absolute best stay at this bed and breakfast. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable. I had nice fluffy towels. It was very quiet and peaceful. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. You get complimentary breakfast every morning and it was delicious. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to visit Please come to the Gaslight Inn. The owner Teresa is amazing. I really enjoyed my stay, I hate to give up the keys",positive
"My wife and I ate here recently, on the 2nd day of it's reopening. My wife had the Roasted Chicken & Pesto Panino and I went with the Bruschetta. Both selections were great. The Gas Light Inn is in my neighborhood so I plan on many future visits and recommend that others give it a try. Love this place!",positive
"We stayed at the GL for over three weeks due to a family emergency. We were treated like family by everyone who worked there, especially the owner, Teresa. The bedding is 5 star and the hot breakfasts are gourmet and healthy and filling. We were shown much care and kindness for the duration of our stay. Place is very clean and very hospitable. We will return in May of this year, for a happier reason.",positive
"Went there during a festival in downtown Glendale. There were only a handful of tables with patrons between at least two servers, but my gf and I sat at our table and were passed by multiple times without being acknowledged. After waiting nearly fifteen minutes without so much as a drink order, we left and went to a pizza place across the street.",negative
At Glendale glitters stopped in for hot chocolate at this hidden gem and such an amazing place the staff is friendly outgoing food excellent and reasonably priced. Took you'd of the rooms really beautiful and fair priced . So if your in downtown Glendale stop on in and see a historic beautiful inn and have a drink and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere and friendly folks and a warm meal you won't regret it,positive
"This is a superb little B and B. Your first look may not convince you, but stay and you will get the full experience. The beds, linens, antiques, the towels are all top quality the best part thought is the service from Teresa the owner and manager. She takes care of you so well and cooks you an amazing full breakfast every morning. Don't pass this place up for some chain hotel...this is so much better at the same or better price. I've been here 4 or 5 time and have never been disappointed. Oh there's also a cool wine bar with wine and beer and other great restaurants in walking distance.",positive
"Great inn! My friends wedding party filled all 10 rooms, service is awesome, beds are super comfy and real thick bath towels. Their little wine bar is amazing, and their breakfast is homemade goodness.",positive
"We recently stayed at the Gaslight Inn for a High Tea Bridal Shower that my mom and I hosted. The High Tea event that the Inn organized was the perfect bridal shower. The food and beverages were excellent and the woman who organized the tea knew what she was doing. I don't have a single complaint about it. If you are hosting an event like a bridal shower, look into this place. We also stayed at the Inn while in Glendale area, and the rooms were very comfortable, nice looking, and reasonably priced. The owner of the Gaslight Inn, Teresa, is great to work with and very friendly. I will definitely be back!",positive
"Great facility! I have stayed here several times since they re-opened. After numerous frustrating stays at chain-motels (that charge the same or more per night) I was so happy to find this quaint little boutique hotel. The rooms are beautifully appointed, clean, and surprisingly quiet. I love the old-town ambiance paired with brand new firm mattresses, plush pillows, large flat screen TV, and modern bathrooms. I am so grateful for the gluten-free food options and personalized, special attention provided by the staff during every visit. It is also an enormous relief to have great espresso in Phoenix - right in the lobby! And, the wine bar features a broad selection of great wines.",positive
"Our wedding was last weekend and what an amazing event. Gas Light Inn made it perfect for our guests. They all had a great night sleep with the top of the line bed, the gourmet breakfasts that come with the rooms and old town feel. We were able to get some much needed time with all the family members that I have not seen in many years. They were so kind to be able to give us enough room to spread out and meet and greet everyone. I will have to say the honeymoon suite was the best. The room was GORGEOUS!! It was romantic, roomy and had a perfect view of Glendale glitters. Beautifully restored and looked after. It has amazing furniture, fixtures, hardwood floor. It also has His and Her toilets, mirrors, appliances and a kitchen. My husband and I plan to make it a tradition to come back every year. Thank you for making this event so special to the us! We found this place through our wedding planner and what a find. We first saw it late in July one night. We met Chad in the bar and he was so kind to give us a grand tour. I fell in love right there. I got chills because it was too perfect for words. We got to see all rooms and hear the ghost story of room 111. It had history and character and I knew my guest would love it too.",positive
"I was so disappointed in the Gas Light Inn. Myself and a few friends decided to have coffee and breakfast here because we like supporting local businesses. We were surprised at the low prices of their menu items but after we received our food, we knew why. My self and a friend had the breakfast burrito that seemed to be 90% potato and it was very small. I finished it in about 6 bites. My other friend got eh caprizi. which was 2 small slices of tomato with the cheese on top. I had never been so I wanted to look around. I asked one of the girls if I could look upstairs and she said of course. As I was coming back down the stairs and another employee said ""um, she told you that you can't go up there, right?"" I said no, she said I could and the girl just rolled her eyes and walked away. I really want this place to succeed, but with their terrible food and customer service, it is not going to happen. I will give it another try at night with live music, but I am not getting my hopes up at all.",negative
CLOSED AGAIN! Drove all the way out there to see Delphine Cortez who was supposed to perform tonight only to find the place dark and shuttered! At least have the courtesty to pull down your website!,negative
"We just had the best time at the Gas Light Inn... we spent two very restful nights in our ""Presidential Suite""; ate more than enough at breakfast, and were happy to be among the first to enjoy the OTG patio! The staff were very friendly- and our hosts were just the best- making sure all details for a guest's stay were taken care of. We truly enjoyed the historic neighborhood and also other sites in Phoenix- while taking in a Padres game (which is why we came in the first place). Location is GREAT and we highly recommend you make plans to stay at the Gas Light Inn. We'll be back as we want to enjoy the live entertainment as well as continue to see the enhancements of the Inn that are being planned. Thanks again to Teresa and Pete- your Bonita guests- Tom and Linda",positive
"Same owners as Old Towne Glendale Wine and Beer Bar. I will be reserving the entire B&B for the night of our wedding, and I can not wait! Everyone here is so nice, and the remodel is amazing. Every room of this 10 Room B&B is fantastically furnished with antiques, and has their own restroom. The building itself if magnificent. I really think these guys are going to capture a great audience!",positive
Stay far away from this place. I don't know what the health codes are in Vegas but I'm sure they are violating a good majority of them.,negative
"Horrible! We were trying to stay at a cheap motel for a night. This was far under with what I expected! Bathroom door was broken, there were outlets that did not work and no hot water! I didn't expect much coming in, obviously it's a retro motel but...cmon!",negative
"Horrible. There were bed bugs! Refused to give refund because they have a ""no refund policy"" everything seemed like it was falling apart. Worse experience ever.",negative
"Why a 5 star rating for a motel? Number one it's clean. Number 2 it's cheap. Number 3, who cares how old the building is when you will be out in Vegas until the break of dawn? The staff is friendly, they live on site, the doors are secure. Taxis are easy to come by and it's about ten-fifteen minutes from the strip. The only complaint is that the building's water/faucet connections are really old and so there is not a lot of water pressure (stayed in room 102) but honestly you can't place a motel with the same standards of vegas hotels. It's affordable. That's basically a place to stay for a few hours with comfortable beds. We had to stay here last minute and it was definitely a great same day one night stay. If you could care less about the outdated decor and old building, than this is the perfect place for you.",positive
The owner was very rude. Told me and friends to go some where else when we had asked about the $45 advertisement price on the sign. Please do not waste your money here.,negative
"Didn't expect much going into this place. Water was hot but there was a bug in the shower. Beds seemed clean enough though. Toilet didn't flush, mechanism was broken. My boyfriend went to inform them and they were pretty rude to him. He came back upset. It was late, they werent gonna return our money, and we were tired. This was a last minute place. Wouldn't stay here otherwise.",negative
"I attended an immersive theatre experience called ""Motel"" at the Gateway Motel. The play consisted of visiting 5 or 6 of the rooms as you traveled from one scene to another that transpired in various rooms of a motel. The rooms were run down and there was only one that didn't have a crack in the flooring running the width of the room. I'm glad we stood and the actors were the ones sitting on the beds. As others have said, this place would only be a last minute, must have a place to stay choice. I think I'd sleep on a chair at the airport first.",negative
You are better off staying in a roach motel. Older than the hills and twice as dirty. It is possible that this broken down shit hole is zombie headquarters.,negative
"Negative stars! I checked in and because a friend was with me to unload my luggage they charged me extra and demanded their ID. The first room they gave me was filthy and the doors nor windows locked with plywood floors. The second room had filthy carpets, broken down furniture, roaches, windows without locks, wet sheets covered by urine scented comforter, molded shower curtain, filthy towels and no hot water. I let the water run for 5 minutes to wash my hands and no hot water. I was told that there weren't refunds. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone.",negative
"Negative stars. Every inch of this property is filthy, shady, and in poor repair. Broken glass, broken door frames, filthy broken curtains, uneven floors. All this I could let slide, but I used my debit card to pay for the room against my better judgement, and lo and behold two days later I have to cancel my card due to fraud. My card was used to make a small test purchase at a motel in Missouri, and luckily my bank has a great fraud detection department and it didn't progress beyond that. I'm embarrassed to admit that I even stayed here, but I would like to help others avoid making the same mistake.",negative
Wow. What an unexpected surprise. I booked last minute and I am very glad I did. The service at check in was amazing and the room is unique and comfy. This will definitely be my home away from home in Toronto.,positive
"NOTE: this too is a review of the venue's multitude of amenities apart from their hotel services. I first visited The Gladstone in 2008 for Cajun music dance lessons then dancing to a live Cajun band. The occasion took place in the venue's Ballroom and I knew quite a few others who attended. I had a great time. Since then I've returned to the Hotel many times for other Events and attractions there. I've viewed the art exhibits on the upper floors, I've been to their annual Nuit Blanche Event once in 2009 and more recently, I've set up Events with a social Group I help run to attend different drinking Events at the venue, namely a beer and food pairing Event in The Melody Bar, a Canada vs U.S.A. Beer Taste-Off in the same part of the Hotel and most notably, their 12 Beers of Summer and 12 Beers of Christmas Events, which feature 12 Breweries located on their 1st and 2nd floors. During and after the Fest. they have a live band and they've had another Event afterward called Shameless Karaoke. All of the Events I've attended at the Hotel have for the most part been very well executed. Their 12 Beers of... Events have had some issues with slow moving lines due to having only one ticket processing table but otherwise they've been great deals (when the beer doesn't run out before the Event ends). They also have other regular Events and you can check the calendar in their website for upcoming ones. To summarize, my experiences at The Gladstone have been quite varied and enjoyable through the years.",positive
"My $1,000 Canada Goose jacket was stolen from the hotel's armoire and the front desk attendant said it would be safe there since she would be there all night. DO NOT leave anything of value with them- anyone can walk out with your belongings. This hotel needs to have a COAT check.",negative
"I ate at the hotel awaiting a workshop that was hosted there. I ordered a side of Caesar salad (it was vegan) and their pasta. The portion sizes were quite small but surprisingly enough to fill you. The pasta was stuffed with cheese and was cooked a little over for my liking but the presentation of both dishes was impressive. The pasta was hot and the vegan Caesar was surprisingly tasty. There were two large chunks of toasted soy with a unique and flavourful dressing over mixed greens. I loved the look of the restaurant as well as the hotel, it is hip, fun and unique. The wait staff was attentive and polite, it felt as though you were being served by your friends at their own place.",positive
Nicely renovated but lacks any personality.The food was' t anything special and the service wasn't great.Pricey for what was served and without silverware.Really needs improve ; but has a great potential.,negative
"Trivia, friends, food, drinks, impromptu karaoke. Where's the bad? Nowhere. There is no bad there. Especially when the staff, from hostess, to server, to bartenders are friendly and helpful. I was at The Gladstone this past Friday for Friends trivia with a group of eight of my best pals, and ended up staying for Karaoke after. What was going to be a two hour outing turned into a six hour outing, so I think that tells you I was having a good time. The trivia was excellent; hilarious host, well thought out and challenging questions, and a very enthusiastic bunch of Friends fans in attendance. The karaoke after was also good. They clearly have some regulars, and a lot of them were pretty good. This is not the kind of karaoke where only half the people can actually carry a tune and no one notices anyway because of they are too wasted. I mean, by 1am there were definitely some people on stage with beer spilled on their shirts, but to their credit they were still singing pretty well. And the audience was super supportive, which is key to any good karaoke venture I think. Kudos to The Gladstone for always being this kind of place: welcoming to all. Last Friday was not my first visit, and it won't be my last either.",positive
I love that the melody bar hosts drag shows on Mondays and shows Rupaul's Drag Race on their TVs. The crowd is awesome and polite and the food was delicious. I ordered the cauliflower burger because my waiter suggested it and it was absolutely amazing! Service is hit and miss here though and I find that the drinks are not made consistent. One week's Caesar was insanely spicy and then the next was bland. Clean bathrooms and a cool spot to chill... My favorite combo for a night out with the girls. I'm a fan!,positive
Brunch: Bacon was clearly cooked hours before and left drying out in an oven or under a light bulb. Potatoes too were dry and tired. Eggs were okay. Plate was uninspired. Service was slow -,negative
"Came to the melody bar for the Thursday colouring and $4.00 pints. This spot is my new favourite place! Great and incredibly friendly service. Chill atmosphere, and awesome live music. Spacious, comfortable, and a cool spot for groups or for couples. Definitely coming back with my friends!",positive
"I stayed here for 4 nights while exploring Toronto for the first time. The location is really great, it's a hip neighborhood. Our room was 70's theme, it had the weirdest furry wall mural of all time. Most comfortable bed I've ever experienced, ever. Very friendly staff and service, including the bar. Had a wonderful stay.",positive

"Not only was this my second time visiting The Gladstone, it was also my second stay in the Teenage Dream room! This charming hotel is located at Gladstone and Queen, and was pretty easy to get to driving-wise. Be warned - they only have a limited number of parking spots (at an extra cost of $25), so you may have to find street parking or paid parking in some of the green P lots nearby. The hotel is beautiful - full of charm, history, and beauty. The lobby is a great intro to the style of the hotel, and the staff are cheerful, helpful, and kind. The elevator is very cool, yes, but I do wish we were able to operate it ourselves, or that someone was on standby for those moments when you have an early check-out and a lot of luggage. Each room is a different work of art ranging from the Biker Room to the Teenage Dream Room, and everything in between. Each floor has a common room that is open during the day (and serves lovely coffee and tea in the morning hours!) to the public. As I mentioned, I've stayed in this room twice, and it's very sweet. The furnishings are fun, but I think the room might need a bit of a refresh. The fixtures were a bit dusty. That being said, I loved the horse lamp, and the bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable - the sheets were so soft I never wanted to get out of them! The room is pretty small, but it's fine for a few nights. There's a couple of things that could have been improved - the access to plugs for phone charging, a book about the hotel and services, and the room was a little bit damp. Maybe that's to be expected in an old hotel though. The wifi can also be a bit sketchy, but they have so many different connections that is one isn't great you can switch them up. I've visited the Tower Room suite which was amazing - I'd love to stay there one day! It's huge and would be awesome for a long term stay. Convenient: there is a Fresh Co. grocery store directly behind the hotel, which is great for snacks!",positive
"I visited the Melody Bar for cocktails and live music last Friday. I was pleasantly surprised to see the bar was half empty when I arrived shortly before 9pm. No cover and I could take in the whole place before finding a great table with a view of everything! Live music was courtesy of Big Rude Jake and The Killer-3. This guy plays swing, jazz, blues, and used to perform at The Reservoir Lounge. Imagine my delight to see he was playing the Melody Bar! It's loud, it's dirty, it's earthy jazz. At around 11pm, the place converts into a karaoke bar! It is before 11pm that the place starts to fill up because the people want their karaoke. There are regulars, people celebrating birthdays, young people and even someone in my group who got up and sang. It was so much fun. A delightful and fun night was had by all!",positive
"Had not been here in few years (almost three years according my first review of this place). The karaoke here is just simply awesome. You have an eclectic group of people here - the hipsters, the late-20's, guys in their 60's. Regardless, everyone comes here for the karaoke - either to watch or perform. I'm still a fan of this dive - drinks are reasonable and there's no cover. Good for: drinks, karaoke",positive
Just close the f'ng door! It's winter and if that skinny jeaned duffus let's the draft in one more time. Put a barrier between the guest entrance and lounge. It's clear though that they stopped giving a crap about this place a while ago so am sure they won't. Food - awful. We got a cheese plate and felt embarrassed for the poor server (who was very nice) who brought it out,negative
"Stayed for three nights over the summer with my boyfriend. We got a great rate from Jetsetter and from the get-go the staff was great- they let me pick which room I wanted via email. We arrived and promptly fell in love with the old fashioned elevator complete with elevator-operator guy, art filled space and cool bar. The room (Faux Naturelle) was awesome, toeing the line between trendy and tacky in a really appealing way. It's true, the showers are really tiny, but it didn't pose a problem for us and the bath products were exceptional (I might still be using the pharmacopia soap I acquired on the visit!). Totally decent complimentary coffee in the morning, and a great location. A-game.",positive
"What a place! My girlfriend and I just visited Toronto for an action packed extended weekend. Naturally I kept my mouth shut on the topic of hotels. I agreed to follow orders and stay where ever she decided. After researching the area, she finally chose the Gladstone, which turned out to be a great choice. We arrived at noon but our check in time wasn't until 3 pm. No matter, Ricardo (the super friendly, extremely helpful, hip to be cool receptionist) came to the rescue. Ricardo was not only able to check us into a new room, he also gave us an upgrade. He explained to us the area, gave us maps, advised us on parking and gave us a detailed rundown of the hotels history. Within the first ten minutes of arriving I new my GF had made the right decision. Here is a rundown of the hotel. Staff was excellent, knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms are each a distinct design from local artists so no two rooms are the same. The hotel is equipped with a bar, cafe and restaurant and is located in a great part of town. The Gladstone is a home run when it comes to hotels. I am certainly not an expert on extravagant hotels, but I can confidently say that this place was the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.",positive
"This review is based solely on the Melody Bar. First and foremost, you will never get a live voice if you want to make a dinner reservation, so make sure you reserve a few days in advance. The first time I tried (last week, they returned my phone call once, I missed their call, called the back and then never heard back). Your reservations are not confirmed until they call you back. So don't even think about making last minute reservations because it is so not happening. We had dinner here on a Saturday night. The vibe is very chilled and relaxed and at 10PM the live band came on. They were quite good. Think Johnny Cash with a bit of Keith Urban mixed in. It was Blues/Country music. The service here is pretty slow. Like, we had been sitting for 1.5 hours and we had only had our appetizer and 2 drinks. The entr√©es were nowhere in sight. The Antipasti Platter was quite interesting - eggs, pork jowl, kimchi, olives, duck liver p√¢t√©, and tuna. The tardy entr√©es finally arrived - to add insult to injury they were cold. I ordered the Cumbrae Farms Steak Frites and the steak was what I would call a ""rough cut"" and rather bland (and cold). The fries... well fries are fries. My friend ordered the Korean Chicken Thighs & Short Ribs which were served with cornbread and a macaroni salad. The chicken was quite tender and came √† la chicken fingers, and the short ribs were well-seasoned (although a tad heavy on the soy = salty). The macaroni salad was creamy but bland, and the cornbread was cold and could've been more moist. For dessert we ordered the Moist Pistachio Cake as well as the Vegan Chocolate Cake. Do vegans not like their chocolate? Because the chocolate flavour in this cake was definitely taken down several notches. And for something labelled moist, (while it was not dry), was not as moist as I expected. The cocktails at the Melody Bar are quite good. I had Tommy's Margarita and the Marmalade Sour. The use of large ice cubes means your drink doesn't turn in to a watery mess. I would probably come back to the Melody Bar for drinks and the entertainment, but not for the food or the service.",negative
"The hotel was very neat, a mix of deco design and art gallery space. Check-in was quick, and the hotel cafe had a European vibe to it, a nice place to hang out and kill some time. Loved the vertical 2-storey wall garden and free wi-fi. The original 1907 elevator is neat, but it requires a special operator. Tip: try not to get a 4th floor room unless you don't mind a lot of walking, as these operators were never immediately available. Also, my husband and I are convinced that the room we were given was not the same artist's design we reserved online, but it was nice nonetheless so it wasn't worth mentioning. Beds are soft, toiletries are organic. The cafe menu was a little sparse and honestly my chick pea crepes stuffed with lentils was a little bland, but good beers on tap. The hotel is a little off the beaten path in an artsy part of town, so it's a hike to get to any landmarks, although we could see the CN Tower from our room. One major thumbs down: no parking lot, so you're on your own.",positive
"The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are clean, the staff is helpful, none of my stuff was stolen from my room while I stayed there, there is a mini bar, and the wifi was fast. The rooms are interesting, there is a variety of art to suit all tastes all over the different floors of the hotel, and there is a lot going on at the hotel (from performance art on the floors with rooms to actual bands playing downstairs). However, if you are in town for something and aren't planning on hanging out at your hotel to party, this might not be your cup of tea. It's a bit loud, and you probably know if a hotel intended for creative types to let loose is right for you or not. For me, the small room and noise (which persisted despite the earplugs that come standard with the room) were not worth the cost as I needed more of a quiet place to come back to after a busy day in the city. It was my fault for not checking more information about the hotel, as they are pretty upfront about the noise (and I was on the third floor, it could be quieter higher up), I was just enamored with the rooms (which were smaller than I expected) and booked it on a whim. Again, I don't really have anything bad to say about the hotel, it just wasn't the right fit for me. If sleeping in an art gallery sounds like your thing, and you aren't a light sleeper, give it a try!",positive
"NOTE: My review is based on the Gladstone as a venue and restaurant than as an actual hotel. Eventually I might do that but for now, no cigar. Over the years I have been here to see a few shows. Drink a few drinks, watch many women take their clothes off... It was Burlesque! People get your mind out of the gutter. This is a PG-13 review. Also for Contact and just checking the general art they have on their floors. All in all, really good experiences. So, the Gladstone realized they can live off just being a hotel, so they went the ""we are a completely entertainment venue approach"" and I would say they have done well. With floors full of art, one lounge, one restaurant, one semi-large room for shows, a tiny hidden room for private parties and galleries and an overall cool attitude, I think they are doing well. Prices are a bit on the higher end of average, which of course I they are doing to keep a little of that ""we are too-cool for school cache,"" that hipsters love and that every one else tries to justify with the exposed brick and retro decour and live music. All in all I would say that it is definitely worth the visit if there are some shows you would like to check out. Not completely feeling it as far as a place to just drop by to hang out or as a watering hole. Maybe for me is the distance? Or the fact that at the end of all of things, aside from the actual size of the place you can find the same elsewhere? Not sure, but I would suggest you make your own choice and check it out. :)",positive
"We were here for brunch last weekend, as our usual brunch spot was still closed while we were already hungry on a Sunday morning. We had the huevos rancheros and French toast, and I added some jasmine tea. That turned out to be a delightful meal. The thing I like is that the menu items look like any menu item from a stereotypical greasy diner. Except that the food in reality is way way far off that. Way better, in fact. The tea, oh, the tea. I fell in love with the tea. It's not your generic tea in a bag that comes in individual sachets. It's tea in a translucent bag that is tied around a wooden stick and hanging on top of your mug. Talk about awesome presentation. The meals were quite amazing too. I was glad that there was the choice to be traditional and get it with fries (or was it potatoes?), or hippie/healthy/[insert adjective here] and get it with a house salad, which was what I did. It looked quite fresh. And yes, fruit comes with the platter as well. Overall, it is a nice subdued place to have brunch. It's a little on the pricey side, but I think it was well worth every dollar.",positive
"It is a rare pleasure to be so surrounded by beauty, history, excellent service, and art. I'm sure many reviews will summarize how unique the vibe is here, and that alone would be enough reason to stay. I'm going to focus on my incredibly positive experiences with the staff at the Gladstone, at which I stayed while presenting at a smaller conference for sex-positive professionals that also included evening social activities that were hosted at the Gladstone. I'm often a budget traveler, not always out of necessity but rather because the nicer places tend to range from pretentious to downright snooty while nickle-and-diming every service. Furthermore, the sleek commercial art/design of those places tends to make me feel like a lonely traveler, because it is slick and pretty but not comfortable (at least, not for me). The Gladstone was a bargain at its mid-range price and I wished I could make a much longer business trip of it. Beautiful, with unique personality, wonderful people (both patrons and staff) and rooms that had real personality. As much as I love the hostel I used to stay at in Toronto, this will be my new go-to place when I visit. I have presented at many different hotels with meeting rooms all over the USA and south-eastern Canada in events from a few hundred to several thousand in size. As a professional who often speaks to groups, especially on taboo topics related to sexual well-being (even though I'm an academic-type), I frequently feel like we are the host space's secret shame and they wouldn't have taken our group if the economy weren't so tight. I have never been a part of a group that was so welcomed and tended to prior to my stay with The Gladstone. Thank you, Gladstone, for making a point of supporting independent thought and community building with all you do. Nobody was not great, frankly, if you'll pardon the double-negative. I appreciate this especially because my travel buddy and I frequently needed extra assistance. Between the two of us we covered a few special needs kinda groups: vegetarian, gluten-free, new to the trolly system, and visually dissabled. I never once got the feeling that it annoyed folks to help us. I didn't get to exchange currency to tip anyone until a day or two into our trip, but folks were just as sweet to us before I got Canadian currency after, which was also deeply appreciated. The staff were absolutely amazing every moment of our stay. It would be understandable if a host and attached restaurants left us more or less to our own devices, but that was never the case here. We were welcomed from start to finish and well attended to for our entire stay, including the many meals we ate here. We had breakfast there every morning, a few lunches and a couple of dinners. Most of the rest of our meals were eaten within easy walking distance at various establishments right in the area. All were delicious and delightful! Oh, and in response to a fellow poster who gave the Gladstone a low rating, I just wanted to note that my experience with my room and toiletries was very positive. The boutique quality toiletries really fit the bill for me, and there was plenty of soap, shampoo, and other things in our bathroom.",positive
The cafe room in the hotel is a great space with high ceilings and is typically never oppressively busy. It's a great place for sunday brunch- laid back atmosphere and the food is good. The fact that you don't have to line up is great along with all the sunday papers they have incuding the New York Times. Better than a lot of other establishments along Queen West IMHO.,positive
"The food was decent when we had brunch here today but the service was absolute shit. The servers ignored me when I came in and were deliberately rude. They were then very slow about everything, screwed up our orders, etc. Did you know the huevos here doesn't even have avocado on it? Lame. I felt over charged, frustrated, and disappointed with the meal when we left. Never again.",negative
"While it's not a set venue, the Gladstone Ballroom is a gorgeous space that's often used for private events including gigs for bands that book their own shows. Art openings, weddings and industry events are also commonplace here, and if it seems too frilly for your tastes, you can always slip next door to the Gladstone's bar and engage in some good ol' karaoke Thursday through Saturday nights.",positive
"I love the idea behind the Gladstone. Part gallery featuring local artists, part hotel, part bar, part cafe... but strangely enough with all these components, I felt like something was missing. Maybe they're trying to do too many things at once, rather than do fewer things, but do them really well? Some notes about the Gladstone, mostly about the hotel portion: -The rooms are pretty small, so be prepared to have your buffer zone infiltrated. We were able to stay in two different rooms (418 and 412(?) )during our stay, since the first one was too loud (due to a music festival event in the ballroom directly below). Both rooms are about the same size, maybe one (412) ever so slightly larger than the other (418). -Clean bathroom, but the shower was tiny and it could have used a tad more counter space. -Girls (or guys) with long hair, BRING YOUR OWN SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER! In an effort to be unique and green, the Gladstone uses bar shampoo/conditioner (two in one). It was fine after Day 1, but by Day 3 my now bird nest hair was begging me for conditioner. -Free wifi, but they charge for all phone calls made, even local calls -Nice karaoke bar downstairs filled with what seemed like a mostly twentysomething hipster crowd All in all a good experience. Beautiful hotel, cool elevator, clean rooms, good location for those not wanting to stay in the middle of a tourist area, friendly staff... though I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to my parents or other families, since it seems to get pretty loud in the evenings.",negative
"The Gladstone Hotel is divided into three funhouses - one is the hotel itself, which few Toronto natives will really know about, another is the ballroom caf√© to the left of the lobby, which serves brunch, lunch and dinner and then hosts DJ nights, afterparties and many years ago, the Fake Prom. The third part, the ""Melody Bar"", is to the right of the lobby and it's the tavern area that people may also know as the home of weeknight karaoke but during the day is frequented with old pals, business people and other random locals. As I sit here in the tavern munching on my sandwich, I'm enjoying reliable, open wifi (no password required - it just works!), peoplewatching and listening to Christmas carols (no joke - Frosty The Snowman played first and Silent Night followed shortly afterward). What more could you ask for from a work spot, really? The menu is wonderfully inventive - there's a ""fry bar"" that includes over a dozen fry toppings and eight sauces, duck samosas, deep-fried brie cheese, a ploughman's sandwich, pulled Berkshire pork and a veggie burger that's reputed to be one of the best in the city. I ordered the grilled cheese with cheddar, Jarlsberg and warm sliced apples on Ace's raisin walnut bread, and it was served with a small green salad and tomatoes plus paprika spiced fries. That's called gettin' 'er done in West Queen West!",positive
"ive been to all parts of the gladstone except for staying in rooms. though i have been in the rooms when there were craft shows there. and ive seen bands in the ballroom, karaoke in the melody bar and talked with the bartenders. theres no pretention here, theres history, theres the culture of visual, performance and musical art in the city. and theres patrons who perhaps cant sing doing karaoke. thats what karaokes for. for those people. and theyve stepped up to the plate in their own way...reinventing themselves many times over. 143 years is along time.",positive
"Alright, I know The Gladstone is a Toronto landmark and a totally happening spot for all the hipsters in the city, but I totally don't get it. Every time I go here, it's just terrible drunken college kids belting out karaoke tunes with no sense of pitch or tone. The service is terrible and the bar itself is outdated and bland. Maybe its just me, but I think there are way better bars in West Queen West in which to get your drink on. I shant be returning here anytime soon, and my ears will certainly thank me for it.",negative
"I have a love/hate relationship with Greyhound. The price while slightly cheaper than driving was a bit much when you take into concideration that the buses were full, I was at the mercy of the bus schedule, so I couldn't stop whenever or wherever I wanted and stay as long as I wanted to. On half the busses the electrical outlets didn't work. The drivers were good, I didn't care for customer service, the reason for my 1 star rating.",negative
"Greyhound is full of disrespectful employees, who seem to have no respect for their customers. To get any respect is rare. They tend to act as if it's a personal favor to go above the bare minimum amount of customer service. I have had a slightly above average experience with a few employees. One of which admitted that the greyhound staff was full of less than friendly people. Particularly would like to shout out your Phoenix terminal. They're all very rude. I'm a very easy going guy and when you piss me off I won't forget it! Because it doesn't happen often at all. Just wanted to take some time out of my day to give these guys the single gold sticker they deserve. Whoever runs this ship. Pull your head out of your ***. Thanks. :)",negative
"So we started at the location in tolleson no one answered the phone and when we finally found it it looked to be closed & was merged with a tire shop? Lol wtf ... 2 guys also looking for their bus were stranded with no bus in sight so we lefttt, we went to the nearest one which is the glendale location and the employees here are ghetto and rude... The bus is late. Don't use greyhound EVER. First and last time.",negative
"2/5 stars simply because it was an adventure. Not amazing in the least. I fly out of town once a month for work on average, this will be the one and only time I use greyhound as an adult. The staff are generally rude and impatient while the passengers range from students to ex cons.. A mix of people that I would not normally encounter otherwise. Spend the extra $100 and fly to your next destination.",negative
1. Untidy like a public urinal. 2. Employees don't know how to talk properly. 3. Fellow passengers were ex convicts and talking about crime and shit. 4. Late buses. 5. Greyhound is an inflexible company maybe because not many people travel on bus anymore. 6. I saw a little girl grab her mom's hand when she passed by the passengers waiting for the bus. 7. Had a peculiar smell inside.,negative
They did a wonderful job helping with my wedding shuttle to Bella Rose and passing out my welcome bags to the guests! They were very accommodating and left a lovely surprise in our suite for the wedding night.,positive
"Great say! Staff were very welcoming and kind. Rooms were very clean and beds were super comfortable. We love the convenience of having a fridge/freezer and microwave in the room. Workout facility wasn't huge but the equipment is nice, updated and clean. It's located close to the 101 and near a lot of shopping. They also have a shuttle that takes you to the mall that's close but we didn't use it. Breakfast was just ok though. That's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. The eggs seemed like they were from powder. The selection of fresh fruit they had was limited and what they did have was unripe. Not a lot of health options for people with diet limitations. I have been to other Hampton inns with a much healthier and better breakfast. Over all a nice place to stay in a convenient location. Would stay here again.",positive
"I stayed here for two nights. The decor of the rooms was quite nice and better than many I've stayed in in this price range. I like that they have a lot of stone work in the bathrooms. The carpet was well kept and didn't gross me out like can often happen in hotels. The beds were nice and comfortable. It didn't feel run down at all like is too often the case. Breakfast was provided till 10AM and was a real breakfast with a decent selection, not just a muffin and coffee. The pool area looked very nice. Overall, the hotel was clean and quite aesthetically pleasing. If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. I'll reserve 5 stars for a super nice hotel, which this wasn't, but for the price, I'd definitely recommend this place and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",positive
"Stayed a week during a work trip - my first time near Tempe/Phoenix. The staff were very helpful, friendly, and patient. The facility and my room were very clean and comfortable. I left my jacket in the closet, and called the hotel. Diego assisted me in locating and shipping, and I'm expecting the coat this week.",positive
"I've stayed here countless nights on business and have seen a number of new hotels pop up in the area. I keep coming back to this Hampton Inn for it's value and location, and the Hilton Honors points of course. I'm a big fan of Hampton Inns in general, as they always offer a nicely furnished, spacious, and clean room for a great price. This location fits the formula, and has very friendly staff, a good continental breakfast, and a great location right off the 202. The hotel has aged well, and the rooms are holding up good. It has all the usual conveniences, with a decent workout room and a nice pool area outside. There are a few recurring issues keeping it from 5 stars. The Heating/Cooling units rattle incessantly. I've complained in the past, but every room I've checked into has this issue. I usually have to shove a cloth or something in the vents to shut it up. Most rooms I've stayed in have plumbing issues like slow drains in the shower or sink. Overall this is a nice hotel for the price.",positive
"We stayed here last year for NHRA and I rated it 5 stars. Unfortunately, this time could not. The front desk is very helpful, the shower is great and the location can't be beat. The issue was the bed. Both my husband and I were in agony with back pain due to the firmness of the mattress. This was not an issue last year in our room. We asked the front desk and they said they have not had the famous heavenly hampton beds at this location but plan to add with a renovation this year. The sheets and towels are thread bare. This time we had a room facing the pool- not a good idea as it gets pretty noisey. The breakfast was good but a mad house of crying babies and agitated adults vying for the last sausage link- only did that one of our 3 days there. Not sure if we will stay here next year for our annual NHRA trip.",negative
Nice Area! Felt very safe. Room was clean and hotel was very quiet. Employees were very nice and very professional! Like everything about this hotel except the breakfast.. It was set up beautifully and very clean. Tons of food! But.... The eggs didnt taste real.. They tasted like fake eggs.. no taste at all. They were perfectly cooked or maybe out of the package..Also the home style potatoes.. same thing.. tasted like dehydrated potatoes out of the bag.. that was a big turn off. I felt like the whole breakfast buffet i was eating fake food! Other than that a nice place. Just get some real food! Not fake food. No one wants that for breakfast!,positive
Honestly one of the nicest and cleanest hotels I've ever been to and one of the nicest Hampton's staff was very friendly at the front desk and the breakfast dinning area was very big and food was delicious and great location! Just if parking with a trailer may be a little hard to find a place for that since parking is narrow,positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights in early July because we were in town for a team sporting event for one of our children. Check in went very smoothly and the front desk employee was very personable and professional. We got a really good rate on the room and I consider this hotel a very good value. We would definitely stay here again. Everything in the hotel was very clean. The room was spotless. I asked for extra shampoo the morning of day 2 since there were 4 of us and Housekeeping left some extra shampoo on day 2 of our stay, so that was very helpful! Our children really enjoyed the pool. The hotel provided towels poolside, so that was very convenient if you didn't have your own towel that you'd brought with you. We took advantage of the free hot breakfast every morning, which went from 6-10am. It included a make-your-own waffle station and usually eggs & sausage plus hot oatmeal and a lot of other options...breads, rolls, muffins, 3-4 types of cereal, 3 different kinds of juice to choose from, coffee, etc. The free breakfast was very convenient and the hot food was kept HOT! Hotel staff kept the breakfast buffet area very clean & well kept. Same thing with the seating/eating area. It never looked like it does sometimes in other hotels....like a pack of animals have paraded through and left a mess in their wake. Parking was free, by the way. The location was very convenient...easy access to get onto the 202 or 101 freeway",positive
"We arrived at this hotel under bad circumstances our daughter was in the hospital at Chandler Regional (amazing hospital) and our Grandson, Lucas was arriving too early to survive. I literally jumped in the car & drove from California. We booked the closest hotel to the hospital. What an amazing hotel & staff! Super nice staff. Very clean and the complimentary breakfast was delicious! When the General Manager, John Villarreal found out why we were there, he left a lovely condolence card and a platter of cheese & crackers. They even adjusted our rate to a hospital rate to help our costs. I would suggest this hotel to anyone & everyone. We stayed here 3 nights (till my daughter was discharged) and we're sad when we had to leave. We had to move to a new hotel closer to their home. I am so grateful to John and his staff for making our stay, in the worst of circumstances, so very nice!",positive
"This hotel was AMAZING. Totally surpassed all my expectations. The staff truly feels like they enjoy working there. They are very accommodating, friendly, and kind. We loved the room. It was updated, clean and DIDN'T smell weird like other hotels sometimes do. Loved the extra seating area for breakfast. The breakfast was very good and fresh! Pool and jacuzzi were also a bonus. STAY HERE you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Stayed here for a fun weekend with my husband, we went to a concert and the mall on Friday night, the Renaissance Faire on Saturday and today we are headed home. There was not one mean employee here! Everyone was super nice. They make it a point to acknowledge you every time you walk past the front desk and even the maids in the hallways would greet you. Super nice! Also met the nicest guy working in the breakfast area this morning. He made sure to warn me that breakfast was ending in 15 minutes and if anyone else in my family was coming down they should come soon. The free breakfast was good, looks like they have a different ""main"" dish every day I saw sausage patties yesterday and like a breakfast fat sausage link today. The room was super clean, the air conditioner, shower, toilet, and tv all worked great! We had a nice view of the pool next door. Speaking of pools we got to go swimming in the pool and it was about 8pm and only a couple people there. We got the hot tub all to ourselves for a good 20 minutes. The hot tub was fantastic after a day at the ren fair! They provided shampoo and conditioner and a couple bar soaps which was nice but I especially liked that there was a makeup wipe since I had forgotten to bring mine from home. They refilled everything except the makeup wipe when they cleaned our room yesterday but if I had asked the front desk for one I'm sure they would have given me another one. They also gave me some plastic bags I could put our dirty laundry in for the drive home. Our bathing suits hadn't dried yet so that was nice. Had zero problems with this place, plenty of parking, and they even have a shuttle that will take you anywhere within five miles. There's not anything within walking distance so if you want a place close to walking distance night life this may not be for you. Check out was easy it literally took five seconds. Would stay here again!",positive
"Very nice, new property. I have stayed in my share of Hampton Inns, this is one of my favorites. I am getting fast internet connection instead of the anemic offering even though I am not a Diamond member. There is Ethernet in the room so far down the hall rooms have good connection to the web as well. Having in room recycling is a big draw for me. There aren't restaurants within easy walking distance but I am sure it will change as the area is more built up. The only downside is no courtesy van service to the airport which is inconvenient to those without a car.",positive
"My AC broke and I spent several night here. I couldn't be happier with my experience. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. I can't really say that it was just one person who was nice, it was actually the entire staff. They definitely went above and beyond. The room was really clean which is important when you have kids. The fridge and microwave were really clean too! Yay for clean stuff!! If you want to stay in a clean hotel with an amazing staff where you get free breakfast, without breaking the bank, look no further!!",positive
Very impressed with Alice. Very friendly at check-in. Helped get my TV fixed when it went on the fritz. Next day when I took the shuttle she was the driver. She does it all.,positive
"We were pleasantly surprised by this well run and clean hotel. Every hotel employee we ran into was friendly and the service overall was the best we've experienced in a three star hotel, ever!",positive
I stay here every time I come to the phoenix area. Great staff that is very friendly. Rooms are always clean and in great shape.,positive
"I recently went on a business trip for training and stayed here. I loved it the employees are so pleasent and always nice. They always are very helpful. They have a little store within the hotel which was really helpful since I landed so late in the night and didn't want to stop for food after. Also its in a great locoation not to far from shopping centers. They also have a shuttle that will take you five miles away. The hotel is very clean. Breakfest is also great, lots of options. I stayed here for a week for my trip and I will go back to this hotel next time for sure! Also love the Pool !",positive
"Immaculate, super clean and modern room, and probably the most diverse free hotel breakfast I've had. They have Asian options (miso and clear soups, Japanese pickles, dried seaweed, rice), as well as an impressive choice of traditional continental (waffle makers with a ton of difference syrups, sausage and cheese scrambled eggs, cereals, lots of fresh fruits, yogurts, pastries, juices, etc). The price was very reasonable too--I've paid a lot more in the past for a lot less. It is a few miles off the interstate in a technological/business section of town, but totally worth the short drive.",positive
"Hampton Inn was a pleasant surprise. I've never stayed at a Hampton Inn before and wasn't sure what to expect. When booking business travel to Arizona, it was the least expensive so It's the one I went with. The hotel is about 20 mins from the airport. The hotel does not have a shuttle (I asked for a pick up) so be prepared for a $45 can ride. The hotel is attractive on the outside and nicely appointed. Very comfortable bed with nice bedding. The lobby and staff were great too. They made water and apples (green and red) available when we checked in. That was nice. If travel takes you to Phoenix consider staying at the Hampton Inn.",positive
"Free breakfast! And if you are on the run, they give you a free bagged breakfast to go. I was very happy with my stay and the concierge was very helpful when i asked what there is to do for like 8 hours that would be touristy. Which was a 2 hour drive each way to Sedona. The hotel was clean, our room was made on time and very well.",positive
"Reserved a block of rooms for our wedding in October for all of the out-of-town family, and Vicki and Savannah were on the money with everything. The rooms were all great and they gave us a free one for my husband and I on our wedding night. We also reserved a conference room for a brunch the next morning, and they were totally fine when we ended up having way more people than I thought show up for it. Their lobby is comfortable and not overly modern in the weird way hotels are getting, and we spent a few nights hanging out and drinking wine during the weekend. They did everything wonderfully and the organization for our giant group went smooth. Very thankful for that.",positive
"Loved my stay at this great hotel! It looks brand new so you can tell it was recently built. Knowing that it's a new hotel, you can assume you'll get clean beds, rooms, and bathrooms and you'd be correct! We had a microwave and a refrigerator in our room, which was awesome! Beds were clean and comfortable. Wi-fi was sometimes kind of slow but it wasn't too much of a bother for me personally. Breakfast was included with our stay and it was great! All the basic breakfast stuff is there and the breakfast area/lounge is beautiful. Complimentary coffee, cookies, popcorn, fruit, water can be found at the front desk area. There's a business center which you can use for printing, a gym, pool, and meeting rooms. The hotel is a bit secluded which I really liked, it's a really nice area around the hotel as well. Can't recommend this place enough! We got a great deal through Hotwire and were paying $67/night which we thought was a steal because this place is great!",positive
"This is a nifty new Hampton Inn. It has the unique quality of being close to a lot (for the east valley Phoenix metro area) but feeling like it is in the middle of nowhere. Friendly staff and very convenient to the southeast valley of the Phoenix metro area. Hampton Inns are just more consistent than many other chains...and I like the @HHonors program. They have some nifty vacation places when I'm not traveling for business. Clean, comfy, modern, convenient...'nuf said.",positive
"I'm an IDIOT. When I checked in, there was no reservation because I misbooked the dates, and I was charged for a unused stay. No problem, the assistant manager promptly refunded me, no questions asked. (Disclosure: Perhaps a perk of being tops in the Hilton kiss-ass loyalty program.) Done in the typical modern Hampton motif, this hotel is new and not a half-hearted remodeled/rebranded hotel. The suite was gigantic even with two queens, a separate living room space, and a wet bar. The big flat TV is double hinged for viewing from the living room or from the beds. Four stories, outdoor pool, gym, business center with printers, free breakfast, and WIFI. The only downside is the location in Chandler, which is good for nearby business travelers but a bit father for tourists. Sometimes, idiots get five-star service even though they don't deserve it. Thanks.",positive
Service is good and they have a managers special during the week that's nice. The manager seems to really like her job. The people who clean the rooms are #1 and Ashley at the front desk.,positive
"Nice. New. Clean. Comfy. Friendly. Most importantly, it has all of my fave tv stations: E!, Bravo, HGTV, MTV, and, of course my most favorite, Disney! I've stayed at all of the other Hilton and Marriott hotel brands in this area and none of them carry ALL of these channels. One of them doesn't even have the Disney channel! THE Disney channel...Um, how do you NOT have the Disney channel?! Do they not realize that that's how us mature, grown ups like to fall asleep??? Recommended!",positive
Nice hotel. Got upgraded thanks to Hilton honors to a studio suite. The room was nice but my complaint was the oversized room still only had 1 air conditioner. In august Arizona is warm...okay hot... and the AC only had trouble cooling the room down. Otherwise a very nice hotel with great rates.,positive
"Props to this Hampton Inn - and it's GREEN!! Beautiful hotel (and it's rather new), close to Fashion Center, well-appointed rooms...Oh heck I could go on and on, but here's what impressed ME: - 30""+ (didn't have a measuring tape sorry) flat screen TV - nice. - Laptop tray complete with cushion, TV remote, and TV guide. - Moisturizer. I'm so tired of staying at places in Arizona that don't provide moisturizer. Hello, DESERT?!? - Friendly staff: My shower didn't have the hottest water, so I mentioned it to the front desk. The manager popped right out and apologized, and said he would go check the boiler room immediately....and he did. - Non-choking rooms. Enough said. - Manager's social/happy hour Tuesday and Wednesday nights (two free drinks each night...haaaaaayyy!) - Comfy sheets, and pillows (and LOTS of 'em) - Cool alarm clock with Nature sounds, and preprogrammed music genres (that's just plain cool) The next time you're in Chandler, stay here. It's absolutely the nicest, cleanest Hampton Inn I've ever stayed.",positive
"Absolutely incredible Hampton. Stayed here for a wedding at Ashley Manor which is nearby. Nicest Hampton I have ever stayed at. (And I have stayed at a lot) Service was outstanding! They knew who I was as I walked in. Ok, so how do they do that? Eric at the Desk and Gloria at Breakfast are like long lost relatives. The bed was to die for. I really wanted to take that white down comforter home with me.( Only kidding Hampton-lol) but really where can I get one for my house? The bed was super comfy and the room is nice. Here is how I know this is a top notch place. The electricity went out while I was there because of construction on Price/101. No one seemed upset, the guests were not screaming or angry, and everyone handled it smoothly and calmly. That tells me this is a fine establishment with a reputation for good customer service. Sure enough, the lights came back on and everything was great.Gloria went around to all the tables checking on everyone and reassuring them during and even after delivering the food that was in the toaster, waffle iron, etc. Way to go Gloria! They have a free shuttle so that's a nice added bonus for wedding guests at the Ashley Manor or super shoppers at Chandler Mall. I want to go back and have a staycation immediately. Oh BTW, the Homewood Suites in the same parking lot is gorgeous too if you need a suite hotel. Happy vacationing.",positive
This place is AMAZING!!!!! Guest service is FIRST CLASS!!! The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN. And the rooms are incredible. The beds are so comfortable and it just feels like you are in a luxury hotel. AWESOME place including some amazing restaurants.,positive
"Just returned home from my stay here and figured I'd write a review. Got in late on Sunday night and went to check in to room. Upon doing so they were nice enough to upgrade us to a suite in one of the towers that had a great view of the pool area and a decent view of the other strip hotels. Love the memorabilia in hotel. Hotel staff was young and sort of lacked customer service skills but I guess you have to start somewhere. We trudged with our bags to the room on the 6th floor. It was a gorgeous room! Had a small kitchen area, a living room/seating area dis-attached from bedroom, a huge bathroom, walk-in shower, huge tub and was decorated nicely other than furniture had tons and tons of dings in it and was kind of dusty... the music player in the wall in room that had surround speakers did not work and had a iPod jack that was for an iPod from 2005, only upside was a great view. First issue though was the beds. They said two queen sized beds but there was no way these beds even came close to queens. They were more like a full maybe even closer to a twin bed. And second issue was that it was supposed to be a NON smoking room but smelled like someone just got done smoking dope throughout the room. It was so strong we didn't even think twice about staying and turned to walk out. But right before we called down to the front desk in which the phone rang and rang for minutes and knowone answered. Finally when they did they seemed a little clueless as to what to do. And then proceeded to tell us they did not have any other available suites to put us in and that our only option was to be put into a basic room non smoking. So that pretty much sucked but It wasnt worth staying in the suite and smelling dope our whole stay. And to top it off there was no way this hotel was full that they couldnt move us elsewhere with a similar room. I just think they didn't want to accommodate us and made it seem like "" well we were nice enough to upgrade you for free so take your pick, either stay in the nicer room and suck it up or we'll put you in a crappier room"". We went ahead and decided to get the basic room. Met the girl at the counter on first floor of tower, she gave us our new room keys and then proceeded to tell us the room was all the way on the other side of the hotel in the second tower, GREAT... so we had to lug all our shit back across the hotel which sucked. Got to the new room and it was nothing to write home about, especially for close to $100 a night. It was spacious but the only good thing was the bed size and the tv. Every inch of the furniture in the room was banged up, hard water stained, chipped, the carpet had what looked like brown shit stains all over it( refused to walk bare foot) and the view was of air conditioning vents on top of the casino/ joint area and a f***ing wall to stare at, I was pretty surprised this is what we got moved to. It had a door you could open but no thanks. No fridge either. The door that separated the room next door had about a two inch space underneath so you can pretty much hear everything going on. But pretty much it looked completely outdated and over partied in by a bunch of people who think they are ""rockstars"", or that I guess they were done putting any effort into renovations or upkeep. I was afraid to even sleep in the bed that maybe the sheets were never changed. It was about as basic as it gets, I've stayed in motels nicer. Now to the bathroom. Shower had 0 water pressure, a fancy shower head that sucked and my shower started to get warm by the time I was getting out. No body wash provided which I thought was weird since they gave shampoo, conditioner and lotion..??? Towels were crunchy and once again everything was banged up and dusty. Never again! We will stay elsewhere for our money since we come often. I was pretty disappointed because I was excited to stay there and thought it would be nice since it was vegas... wished my experience went different. The food in hotel is good, nothing to write home about either but was nice, little pricey, drinks are too, (bring your own stuff). We saw the rating the rock vault show Monday night and that was very good! Other than the small bottles of Figi water were $8 a piece! First and last for me!",negative
"What a craphole. This is probably fine for 20 something's coming here the first time but the burlesque house red wallpaper, black fixtures, and poor lighting really don't do this place any favors. The casino is small and open, that's fine. Lots of shops and places to eat-- that's okay too. But in general, this place is pretty 80s tastic and outdated. All the furniture is beaten up and chipped in my room, my floor reeks of smoke, and my shower sprays everywhere but down. I have two full sized beds in my room, not queens, and the mattresses feel pretty old/squishy. Wouldn't stay here again and wouldn't recommend it unless you're in a total a pinch.",negative
"I struggle to find words for how lame this place is. The only rock here is the one you're stuck between with a hard place on the other side. Restaurants close at 10:30pm on Saturdays, general vibe at the hotel is boring, and it's not close to anything else that is cool. Spare yourself the annoyance and stay somewhere on the strip.",negative
Definitely a very disappointing experience management is rude and needs to take a class on how to treat paying customers. When upgraded for the inconvenience they caused didn't make much of a difference. Not impressed at all. Better off staying at a Marriott for sure.,negative
"In editing my previous review, very satisfied with how the issues were taken care of. I appreciate the management reaching out to clarify further and fix the issues mentioned. It bodes well and speaks volumes of any business that wants to make sure their customers leave happy and satisfied. Most would likely do nothing and ignore in hopes of other customers leaving good reviews or rating well rather than focusing on each review made. It made me feel valued as a customer. In terms of other hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas, I've never had one that made such an effort to deliver great customer service. I've had many that simply shrugged off complaints and went about their day. I feel fully satisfied with how I was treated, having my concerns taken seriously, I look forward to my next stay here soon.",positive
"Just got back from my trip to Vegas, and have to say the worst part of my stay was where I stayed. I had planned on giving HRH a two-star review because after the ridiculous number of problems we had - to be detailed shortly - they did make a good effort to redeem themselves by upgrading our room. But, my parting experience from this dismal establishment was getting screwed one last time with transportation to the airport. Soooo, here goes: We checked into our room, chilled for a bit, then headed to the strip for dinner. We decided to take an Uber. We went to the main entrance and were told the Uber pick up was at the other side of the hotel. We went there and waited for our Uber. Dude went to the main entrance. Not HRH's fault. I get it. But the reason he went to the front is: HRH keeps moving the pick up point. Throughout our stay, we attempted to be picked up at the designated Uber pick up, the main entrance, and another parking garage (also a ""designated pick up,"" depending on who you ask) - all places where Uber drivers were told they needed to go to pick up passengers. And, on the last day of our stay, as we were waiting at the Uber pick up point, we were told it had been moved, yet again. The pick up point now? A driveway where the drivers had no room to turn around. So, with all our luggage in tow, we walked to get our Uber, and waited patiently for the large number of cars making three-point turns because HRH didn't think it was necessary to provide a proper pick up point for its guests. Inconvenienced, yet again. But, our biggest problem: we got locked out of our room. And, of course, the employee said it was our fault for demagnetizing our keycards. 'Cause, you know, we're dumb. We tried to explain that it was impossible for four keycards to have been demagnetized when they were not near any source that would do that. Whatever. So, we got new cards. And, yep, they didn't work. Trip #2 to the front desk. We were told they'd replace the battery in the lock, because that's what's wrong. But, that was not it. Their tech guy said we'd need to move or wait for the locksmith. So, we couldn't go anywhere for the rest of the night because we'd be locked out again. They scheduled a locksmith to come the next morning. He showed up 2-1/2 hours late. There went our morning and plans to go to the Grand Canyon. So, while all these various people with walkie talkies were congregated near our door, we asked them to have housekeeping come clean our room because they had never showed. Of course, they said, they'd be happy to see to that. And, you guessed it, they never showed that night. So, we had to ask again the evening of our second day, because we still hadn't had anyone come clean our room. So, on our third trip to the front desk to get new key cards, we asked to talk to a manager, to describe the progressively longer list of BS we were having to deal with. The assistant manager with whom we talked was sympathetic, and upgraded us to a suite. Yay, HRH! That, and all the cool rock memorabilia, got them to three stars. But, then, with every Uber ride we took, our frustration grew, because we had literally no idea where our driver would show up because each one would tell us they were being told to go pick up people at different locations. And we saw first hand how much grief the drivers got from the HRH staff. So, down to two stars. But, with that final pick up issue, I decided I'd had enough, so 1 star is what HRH gets. I am definitely going back to Vegas, but HRH will not get my business.",negative
"Employee Janice in reservations has THE WORST attitude and customer service skills I've ever encountered! Horrible experience because of that! Spoke to her supervisor, who didn't seem to care much about my complaint. Thumbs down!",negative
OMG! This is the dirtiest hotel I've been in my life. No cheap at all. Same price range as any other in the area. The sink was clogged. We called front desk who sent a guy that was 1/2 hour dealing with the sink. Left but still clogged. No smoking bedroom with smoking bedroom towels. You can see the dust over the desk.,negative
The Hard Rock Hotel and casino is the best place to stay in Vegas. Although it is off the strip it still beats all others. A short Uber or cab ride gets you anywhere in minutes. The Nirvana pool is amazing and the restaurants are outstanding. I especially loved the Pink Taco restaurant,positive
"Last year (October 2015) we were guests at Hard Rock Hotel. The room was good and the staff was amazing. I can't give the 5 starts because they didn't open all pools for their guests. Only a small one without paying because the rest were open for a party. We thought that this is not fair. But, another excellent point for Hard Rock Hotel is the croupiers. They are incredible!!! Very, very friendly. We didn't know how to work the roulette and other ""games"". And they explained everything to us!!! Yesterday we came back there (August 2016) and they did the same. Excellent people like croupiers and person. Chapeau!!! Not like at Bellagio or Caesar. My suggestion for gambling is to go to Hard Rock Casino, seriously",positive
"TL;DR: average spot, 10-min drive from the Strip, average/bad restaurants in house, underwhelming fitness center, pricy for location and hotel amenities (a room split three ways for three weekday nights cost us each $150 with fees incl.) Location: you will need a car or an uber to go anywhere. this place is about a 10 min drive from anywhere on the strip, and a 25 min walk during the day (do not recommend it at night bc sketchy). My friends and I uber'ed everywhere, which gets annoying after a while due to Strip traffic and cost (we sat in traffic for 50 minutes once to go two blocks). There's a shuttle, but it runs infrequently from 10-5 and drops you off near the Wynn, which is still a good walk from everywhere else. At least it's close to the airport, about a 10-15 min drive. Room: I came with two female friends and we shared a queen room in the casino tower. It was clean, spacious and pretty nice, but our view on the second floor was of a bare rooftop. Beds and pillows were a little on the softer side, and I woke up with dry eyes every morning since the room didn't have a humidifier of any sort. Great water pressure in the shower, but the house shampoo and conditioner is watery - bring your own. Hotel: you have to walk through the casino to get to any of the rooms and the hotel is a mess of hallways and different corridors. Confusing layout. When we were there, the gym had also been relocated to a tiny room next to the Reliquary spa, and every cardio machine (all ten of them, anyway) was being used at 10AM on a Thursday morning. The center is stuffy and has terrible ventilation. There's a minuscule open floor area for mat workouts for maybe 3 people to workout and about 5 weight machines. I guess they don't expect visitors to Vegas to be anything but hungover during the daytime. Food: I strongly suggest going down the street for dinner, since there are plenty of good restaurant options nearby and the ones in house are not spectacular. My friends thought Pink Taco was terrible and Fu was similar to cheap takeout at a 300% markup.",negative
"FANTASTIC! !! First time visiting and loved it! !! We took the VIP Backstage Experience. ...I can't say enough. Our group was varied in ages and likes...all had something they could love. The staff was friendly to the point you would have thought we'd known them for years. They were knowledgeable, pleasant and enhanced it all. Dinner was above expectations. I can not recommend enough. ... Experience the VIP Backstage Experience. ..it's a DO NOT miss. As far as Hotel stay, I can not say --- we didn't actually book a room and stay.",positive
"In the words of the philosopher M.Jagger: you can't always get what you want. but if you try sometimes .. you get what you need. (after wasting a few hours) For new years 2012/13 we enjoyed our stay in a HRH Tower King Suite with the lovely ""Tea for Two"" Tub. Since our plans for this trip included Journey at the Hard Rock and Ka at MGM Grand we went back to the HRH Tower King Suite. I'm 6'8"" so a big tub is a big plus in my book, in fact, it's exactly why we got this room again. Imagine my surprise when we checked in to the room and found a lousy 'standard' tub. Odd, since their web site explicitly states: Each 701 square foot king room includes .. with cast iron ""Tea for Two"" tub' .. nope. After spending far too long on hold we were promised the *right* room for our 2nd night. It was busy, I get it, you take what you can get. We followed up in person with the HRH Tower guest services people that we're not looking for an upgrade, just the 'tea for two' tub that was advertised. The next day we picked up the keys for our new room in the Casino Tower. A lovely room, although a bit loud since it's 'pool view' .. with a *terrible* 'shower / bathtub combo' deal. Seriously ? Did you not *just* promise us the room we booked with the bath tub we *explicitly* asked for ? After more time on hold and dealing with a front desk manager who didn't know the difference between a standard King Suite and an ADA Accessible King Suite we finally got the keys to another room in the HRH Tower, with the advertised 'Tea for Two' tub. We probably wasted over an hour in the process but that's how you want to spend your precious weekend off, right ? Pro-Tip and Pet Peeve: you have *two* nice 40"" Sony Bravia LCD TVs. Why can't you correctly set brightness/contrast and get HD content on them ? Their 'commitment to excellence' was lacking in other areas as well I'm afraid. Exposed electronics in the mini-bar, poor service in the taxi line (there are two taxis waiting around the corner, could you maybe call them over?) and generally unacceptable wait times for simple room service orders. Coffee and some eggs shouldn't take over an hour. Rather than risk going through the same ordeal once more I think we'll just go with the MGM Grand Spa suite next time.",negative
"I have stayed here twice in the last year. Great place to stay while in Vegas. Room was great, view was great. Bed was comfortable, I have no complaints.",positive
"4 night stay for a birthday party weekend. Room 308 in casino tower has double beds. Not very comfortable. No place to charge phone by bed. Tv seems older. I'm guessing this is the original tower and wasn't designed for today's traveler. Curtain rod falling off ceiling. Climbing in and out of bathtub shower combo a challenge because it is so high. Floor in bathroom area is slippery regardless of whether barefoot, in socks, or even some shoes. Room overlooked pool and the patio for culinary dropout. Don't try to take a daytime nap or even talk on phone while the music/dj is blasting away until about 630 pm. Hallway noise comes into the room. Hotel lines for pool access run past the casino tower elevator bank. Overall vibe is that to be cool means loud music and scantily clad females. WiFi is horrible and is part of the $25 resort charge. Hotel did multiple credit card holds. Hotel bill is line itemed different than Email confirmation so had to do math to make sure it was correct.",negative
Wish I could give this place negative 5 stars. One of the few places in Vegas where I can play slots for over and hour without being offered a drink. The entire cocktail staff fails so miserably at their job I wonder how they are still employed. Playing at the bar is not any better as I sat for about 10 minutes playing dollar video poker before even being acknowledged. It's an astonishment how this place is empty all the time with all this first class customer service.,negative
"I come to Vegas every couple of months to visit my mom and have never stayed at the Hard Rock. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and comfortable my experience was. The rooms are large and comfortable with total black out curtains. The bed feels like a pillow of feathers, top quality bedding that you just sink into! (And this is just the basic standard rooms in the Casino Tower) What's also nice about staying here, it's easy to navigate in and out. It doesn't seem like you are walking miles and miles to get through the casino to your room. I was concerned that the rooms would be a let down since I got such a great deal online...$72 (includes all taxes and resort fee). Customer service actually exists here - the employees ROCK! I would definitely stay here again!",positive
"The only reason we stayed at this place is because my husband was attending a seminar there. When we checked in, we were told we didn't get a king as requested even though we booked way in advance & were told we did have a king bed. The hotel isn't convenient to anything & we had to take cabs to go anywhere, which were ridiculously expensive. The shuttle was never available when we needed it. HRH is very old looking & worn, from the carpet to the decor. No bathtub, which I really missed. Outdated tv with few channels & the room looked like it needed cleaned and dusted. The rock music was blaring constantly & it wasn't what I consider good old rock & roll. My husband enjoys playing blackjack but the table games started at $15. The crowd is very young, lots of tattoos & Affliction shirts. I saw security escort out two females that appeared to be hookers. I never observed anyone winning much at the slots, which is unusual in Vegas. When we went downtown one evening, people were winning all around us, even if it wasn't big amounts. This place is dead & depressing and we wished we could have just stayed downtown when we went, at least people looked like they were having a good time there. The only positive thing I can say is that the Pink Taco had really good food. HATE this place & will NEVER go back. Only gave it one star because there wasn't a zero.",negative
"I would love to give Hard Rock 5 stars but the front desk is a joke. Angel and Allison need to go back to hospitality school. When the front desk tells you the resort fees would be waived off because carpet soaked, wifi not working, crying babies next door, and rooms not ready until 5pm!!!! Then you go to check out and resort fees still charged to the rooms. Thanks for lying to our entire group. When we question it Angel at the front desk laughs. Very professional! Only front desk agent that was pleasant do deal with and actually smiled and asked how may I assist you was Mallory. Mallory you should move on to a hotel where they actually care about their guests. Other than the front desk staff the hotel is great from amazing restaurants and very fun nightlife. Never to crowded in the casino, probably because off the strip and smaller but nice not have to fight for a spot on a table or machine. Hard Rock has some awesome suites as well, just don't expect them to be ready until late afternoon. Even if the front desk tells you it's vacant at 1030am and will rush it. Another lie!",negative
"We stayed because we found a good deal on groupon and didn't mind the distance from the strip...however even for the price, super disappointing experience. When I called for check in time I was told 3, when we arrived i was told between 3 and 4.. We didn't get a room until 445 and that's after me having to complain. The bell boy at the desk was extremely rude and unprofessional, even cursed at me. Like I get we're at the hard rock but really?! I called the maid service for extra towels and had to wait almost hour to receive them. All in all the staff is rude and everything at this hotel was difficult. I've stayed at hotels that were even cheaper and had a better ""5 star"" experience.",negative
"First off, FEES FEES FEES! I've stayed in Vegas on numerous occasions and have never paid over what I paid upon room reservation (aside from the once-in-a-while midnight snack fridge grab). At check out the total doubled that of the rate quoted to me on Priceline. These fees were for DOWNGRADING rooms, and a service fee. Service fee which includes use of wi-fi, gym, and ""free"" shuttle to the strip(which ends at 5pm btw!). All of which are normally included in the price of rooms at normal hotels. I ended up paying more for an off-strip, lackluster, dated, and dirty bathroom hotel than I would have if I just got a room ON the strip. Speaking of dirty, the rooms need major renovating, especially the bathrooms. I was in Vegas for the Marathon and post-run, all I wanted to do was take a nice long hot shower and feel as clean and comfy as I could get. Their bathrooms are poorly lit with flourecents, the toilets were not clean and had loose screws, and the countertops were falling apart. The beds were not as comforatable as the beds in several other Vegas hotels. The staff was un-welcoming and entitled. And the Casino lacked the ""life "" and vibe you want when staying in Vegas. Don't stay here...stay on the strip.",negative
"I stayed there with my wife and two kids in 2010. It was super fun. The pool is the best, the room is super modern and comfortable. Everywhere you look reminds you of rock, fun, good times. The staff is super friendly. The only think I can not review is the casino, because I wasn't allowed to go there with the kids.",positive
"I came here for a conference and dealt with many different aspects while I was here...so I will break it down accordingly. 5 stars for the conference staff - the event planner, caterers, catering manager, etc. were all exceptional to work with and really worked with us to make sure that our meeting went exceptionally well 5 stars for the business center woman being AWESOME and friendly. She was super helpful when I was trying to print things last minute for the meeting. 3 stars for the conference room (Monterey) - the acoustics made it difficult to hear at times but microphones made up for it. 5 stars for the hotel rooms. Super modern, trendy, and reasonably priced at $69 a night for our group rate. 2 stars for my check-in experience. Had to go to 3 different check-in desks before I found the right one. Some of the staff had no idea what they were talking about and kept sending me in circles. Great experience overall - I wish this hotel had been on the strip but really enjoyed the amenities and staff here. Great event and rooms!",positive
"I will give HRH a few points as I believe that the decor was out of this world for anyone who just loves rock and roll. That's unfortunately not me. Moreover, the dimness and darkness of the hotel lobby bothered me greatly. The pool, on the other hand, was PHENOMENAL. Just AMAZING. Sadly, I would not go out of my way off-strip for a place I find unsettling that comes with poor gaming. I lost non-stop on the slots. :(",negative
"I've often gambled here and bought the requisite Hard Rock Las Vegas souvenirs, but I've never stayed here.....until now. All I have to say to myself about that is: Why the hell did I wait so long to do so? From the moment I arrived to the Reservations counter to the time I checked out, I've never had such a smooth and comfortable stay. I got a corner room in the Paradise Tower on the 16th floor and was greeted with the best view I've had in Vegas. The left hand floor to ceiling window showed the 2 HRH pools while the right hand side window showed the LV Strip in all its glory. Another plus is that there were fewer drunken idiots there than I thought there would be! I saw people of all ages there, including this cute couple in their 60's hanging out at Center Bar Thursday night watching the NBA game. I've read previous posts about how comfortable the beds are here and have to agree 100% with them. It's not the best I've ever slept in but it ranks up in my top 5. While there I ate at Mr Lucky's, which is a personal fav of mine in Vegas. For players club members, the $4.99 steak & egg Graveyard special and the $7.77 Steak & Shrimp Gambler's special cannot be beat. (NOTE: They recently changed the hours for the Graveyard special from Midnight to Noon to Midnight to 8am). I also ate at Pink Taco which was pretty good but not spectacular. They have a pretty good happy hour special for 99 cents tacos and margaritas between 1-3pm and 9-11pm Monday through Thursday, I didn't get around to Johnny' Smalls for their AYCE Tapas but that is on my to do list for next time (NOTE: it's in the HRH Tower casino portion of the complex; I saw more than a few people walking down the corridor where the shops and some restaurants are looking for it). This brings me to the only ""complaint"" I have about this place. Anywhere you go inside a LV Casino, you see signs after signs directing you to restaurants, hotel towers, etc but none at the HRH. In the past, it was a pretty easy place to navigate since it was all in the round, so to speak but since the 2 expansions and renovations have doubled the size of it all, it would be a good idea to have better directions to give customers and guests on where to go (the property map they give you upon check in is good but really, how often is it looked at after you first get to your room and head out?). Overall, I had a wonderful stay and look forward to my next stay there in September.",positive
"In order of why I gave this hotel a 1-star: 1) I am sure all hotels do this, but the front desk agent told me that she had a ""better"" option for me and was going to move me to this room as it had a ""better view."" Now I reserved a suite in the HRH tower so was shocked when I opened the door to a small room and upon checking in I was told that my party has been down graded to a regular room because HRH over-booked. As any american would do in this situation, I called front desk immediately and complained - I was finally transferred to Grant the manager and he gave me the same apology. Now I understand if there is absolutely no suites available - but there has to be some sort of compensation for not providing me what I paid for! The only thing Grant offered me was a $50 food credit. He proceeded to try to sell me another single room at a discounted $150/night so that I would have two rooms instead of one. At this point, it no longer became a monetary issue but purely one of principal - I paid for something and I should receive what I paid for especially since HRH e-mailed me 24 hours prior to my arrival confirming my suite! To anger me even more, Grand proceeded to say that HRH reserves the right to downgrade and this was in the ""small print"" - yes, he used the ""small print"" argument to justify their actions. A full hour wasted on the phone - conclusion - $50 food credit and a promise that he'd try to move me to the suite I originally reserved. 2) Location location location - remember, this hotel is totally not on the strip. Although it may be a bit cheaper than other ""nice"" hotels the amount you use on taxis to go anywhere erases any money you think you're saving. 3) This hotel has some low class guests. I exited the elevator into the common elevator waiting area by my room around midnight and walked past a horrible sight - yes, there was a couple intimately involved in adult activities in the public elevator foyer! No joke - next time I go back to Vegas, I'm sticking with the Wynn or Cosmo - not worth saving a few bucks.",negative
"A few friends and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock on a road trip out to the Rose Bowl. Despite the little time we had, it was an overall pleasant experience. We didn't arrive in Las Vegas until 11 p.m., so we had a late check in. When we walked up to the front desk, we were told we were ""upgraded"" to the HRH, the newer hotel. I wouldn't call it an ""upgrade"", just a newer hotel, which I'm assuming was cleaner and nicer than the other hotel tower. The beds were great and comfortable. The room or the floor did not smell of smoke at all which is a major plus. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the bathroom door didn't lock. Good thing I was comfortable with everyone I traveled with. The only down fall was the 4.99 steak 'n' eggs breakfast at the restaurant off the casino. One friend and I ordered our steak medium rare and did not feel so great later on. There was a more expensive steak 'n' egg option (leading me to believe the steak was not too sketch), but hey, you live you learn. It's also far from the Strip, but we were really only there to crash. Would definitely stay here again.",positive
"Dear Hard Rock Hotel, I hate you. No really, I do. Ok, maybe it's not so much you but your patrons. Bleh. All that attitude and silicon can suck it! And I question your choice in music...c'mon Maroon Five and Matchbox 20?? More like SOFT Rock rather than HARD Rock....you are one step away from playing John Tesh. Ok, I've trashed you enough. Let me tell you why you got 3 stars outta me. I was in Vegas on business and met up with friends who happen to be out in the area. They wanted to hit up their usual spot, The Pink Taco, so we did. Afterwards they wanted to gamble so we hit up some slots (go big or go home, right?! haha) and for the FIRST time since I turned 21 (nine years ago) I was carded at a slot machine. THANK YOU. Sincerely, S-dawg",negative
"When my beloved Texas Longhorns were playing the Mobilehoma Sooners a few years back, the press had decided that OU would beat my team. As victory was apparent for the Longhorns in the 4th quarter, those of us in the burnt orange and white were able to cheer ""OVERRATED.....OVERRATED"". That is pretty much what I want to do every time I walk into the Hard Rock. I enjoy partying in Vegas just as much as the next person, but everytime I go to the Hard Rock, it gets a little more thuggish and a little less tolerable. Last time I played craps, I was the only one playing while everyone else was playing the Field. Ugh, nothing worse than Field betters. Anyway, for my trendy, fun, young hotel experience, I would pick the Palms anyday. We are officially finished with the Hard Rock.",negative
"Do not rent a car from this location. I was directed to this location via State Farm to rent a car while my vehicle was being repaired. Although two people work here, one person hides in the back office as people line up out the door way. My rental was a 2018 Ford Escape. I drove from Hertz to work and noticed the air wasn't that cold. When I took the car out on my lunch break I realized the air did not work at all. I called and asked if I could swap the car out and was told that they had 0 rentals left at their location but I could swap it out at the Hertz off of Elliot and the 10. Someone at the Chandler location called this location ahead of time to make sure a car was available. When I got there I was told a car was not available. I had two options, either go to a location in Mesa or the airport. Not wanting to run in to the issue of a smaller location running out of vehicles again, I chose the airport. When I got there I was told since the airport location is separate from the other locations around town, they could not swap out the car. I told them I was not leaving until I had a car with AC. An employee named Lena worked with me and thankfully was able to work out a transfer to get me a new vehicle. Upon returning my rental to the chandler location I was told that there was a $35 fuel fee since the car with the broken AC was returned with less than a full tank and they could not reverse this. I had to drive around in 110 degree weather to get a proper vehicle, why would I be charged for the fuel they made me use? Before I dealt with this location I saw there were many bad reviews but I thought it wouldn't be so bad. I was very wrong, it was worse.",negative
"1. Rental associate forgot to give me the key FOB to the vehicle. 2. Rental associate did not inform me that the vehicle was a hybrid and is operated differently than other vehicles. Ended up having to call roadside assistance because I couldn't get the vehicle to start. Nobody told me I had to push on the brakes while pushing on the ""start"" button. Roadside assistance tried to tell me over the phone that the car was overheated and I just needed to let it cool. They also said it would take an hour to arrive, so I ended up just calling Ford and asking them to help, then cancelling the service call. 3. Oil change reminders popped up every time I started the car. 4. Two days into the rental, the ""low tire pressure"" light came on while I was going 80 mph on the freeway. The PSI on the left rear tire was far lower than the other tires. Note: I understand that this particular branch cannot be held directly responsible for all of these issues. However, when renting out hybrid vehicles, they should a.) tell the customer it is a hybrid vehicle and b.) ensure that if there are any nuances that apply only to hybrids and not to regular fuel vehicles, they make the customer aware of them before driving off. And I don't think making sure the oil is replaced & the tires have sufficient air is asking too much of a reputable car rental company.",negative
"From start to finish it took me about 52 minutes from walking in to getting into the rental car. It was a Monday, and there was 2 people that was in front of me. 2 other people showed up after me as well. I'm sure their wait time was over an hour. The average person here would have given this place a 1 or 2 star review at most. The place is VERY small, located inside the of a hotel in downtown Chandler. Its literally like the size of a cubicle. Regardless the gentleman that was there on both of my days kept calm regardless of how many people he had waiting on him. One dude was literally just cussing up a storm and wouldn't shut up because he has to wait longer than 10 minutes lol. Hertz employee handled himself well. Hertz needs to help out this guy and get a better seating arrangement though so this place can have better reviews!",negative
"BEWARE THIS LOCATION IS HORRIBLE!! DO NOT RENT FROM THIS LOCATION, THE MANAGER IS A REAL ASS AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS! TRUST ME, I WILL LET EVERYONE I KNOW DO NOT GO TO THIS HERTZ LOCATION! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I reserved a car and I even called in to check in that morning to confirm everything was taken care of and I would be down to pickup the car! Who cares when I get there, I was paying for the car whether it sat at Hertz or whether I was driving it! However, when I get there the manager says we don't have the car any longer, if you want a vehicle you have to now rent an SUV! WTH, why didn't he tell me that when I called him, why didn't he call me to tell me before I found a ride to get to Hertz? Hell no, he waits for me to get there and I am now in a panic. No apology, no nothing! He tells me I have to rent and pay for an SUV and he over charged me, he also told me he DID NOT charge me for LOSS DMG WVR AND THE ADDITIONAL PREM ROAD SERICE AND HE CHARGED ME! What a damn liar and he lied right to my face and told me he wasn't changing me for the Additional Products and he DID CHARGE ME! He charged me $74.89 a day and I needed the vehicle for 2 weeks and 3 days, my god it would have been well over $1,275.00! I was shocked, upset, crying and I had no way to leave that place, I was stranded and he knew it and he enjoyed watching me break down! I took the car and went to another Hertz and dropped it off there and got a rental car that cost me $250! However I had to pay the $74.89 and used the vehicle for 4 hours! DO NOT RENT FROM THIS GUY, GO TO ANOTHER HERTZ PLACE OR GO TO ANOTHER CAR RENTAL PLACE DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION! MARK MY WORDS, HE WILL BURN YOU! WHY RESERVE A CAR IF THEY WON'T EVEN HOLD IT FOR YOU, IT WAS A BAIT AND SWITCH AND IT WENT INTO HIS POCKET - DO NOT RENT FROM THIS LOCATION! I hope someone from Hertz calls me on this and I have no problem telling them what a terrible man the manager is, he does not know what Customer Service means nor does he offer it in any way!",negative
"My mom and I had a great experience here. She booked her rental car at this hertz versus near the airport to avoid the huger taxes. Something to note- the hertz rental is inside the crowned plaza hotel- that was super confusing because there was no sign. One you enter the tiny hertz section is the the right of the main check In desk. Shannon helped us and she's the main reason for the 5 stars. She was super sweet, helpful and took the time to walk my mom through payments, any changes she wanted to make and how that would affect her payments, plus recommendations for maximizing her gold member status. This location also has a drop off, so we don't have to actually go in when we return the car, which is convenient. Thank you Shannon for making this such a smooth and pleasant experience!!",positive
"Let me start by saying, that I made a reservation for a van in advance and received a confirmation number( 11 days in advance).However less than 24 hours prior to my vehicle pickup, they called me to let me know there were no vans or like vehicles available. What is the point of making a reservation if you are not going to have what is reserved. At this point it is too late to rent any vehicles from any other company. I called the manager and felt like I was in a bad episode of Seinfeld. ""Anybody can take a reservation, its the hold thats important."" Do yourself a favor and rent from someone other than Hertz, unless you are willing to gamble on your travel plans. Our trip plans were ruined by this company. Have to give them a star, but even their customer service was bad and deserve zero stars all around.",negative
Terrible service. Reserved a car online to pick up at 11. Arrived at 1130 and the car wasn't ready. They charged an extra 200$ deposit on top of the rental fee which they didn't tell me about until after they swiped my credit card. Car was finally ready nearly 30 minutes later and it is horrible to drive. I can't tell if it's poorly maintained or just an awful car. Also the employees just act like they don't care and provide poor service. Will never rent from here again and wouldn't recommend anyone else go here either.,negative
The Hertz in Chandler was very pleasant when we first got our rental car.. when I tried to get a hold of them to ask questions about when and where to drop off the car I called 20 times got disconnected after hearing them laughing and joking in the background I got placed on a 20 minute hold with out anyone checking back with me. I also talked to Cassie would told me that her computers were down and would give me a call back as soon ad they were back up which never happened. When I finally got a hold of them again I spoke with Tyler who was very rude and wouldn't let me tell him why I was calling. He cut me off and told me I didn't know what I was talking about. I will NEVER rent from them again!!! I wouldn't even give them 1 star...,negative
"This Hertz location has very rude and uniformed employees! We tried to rent a compact car for 5 days and were quoted a rate (w/tax) of $184. When inquiring about pick-up service, Danielle recommended I call the Hertz at the airport. Not only were the rates higher there, but they did NOT offer pick-up service. Called the Chandler location back and asked about renting the compact car. Charles was very indifferent, had poor listening skills and quoted a rate $50 higher! When asked to speak to his manager, he stated he was the manager. When asked to speak to his supervisor, he refused! Hertz must not require much in terms of customer service of their ""local edition"" stores! Charles only gave an 800# for customer service, which was not set up to accept complaints of local stores. We did, however, receive the name & tel # of Charles' direct supervisor, so will be filing a complaint with him. Stay away from Hertz Chandler if you expect reliable, accurate quotes and even a basic level of customer service!",negative
"When I expect to have a car on Monday, call to confirm my reservation, but they have been overbooked, leaving me stranded with no way to get to work and no time to have a plan. Maybe you should consider having more cars on Monday, for I'm sure this isn't the first time this has happened. I'd give 0 stars if that were an option. Horrible customer service",negative
"They are horrible! They let me leave the lot with out the keys so by the time I got home, I realized I had no keys I then proceeded to lpok for them opening the glove compartment I see dirty used napkins that they did not clean out! I had to have my bro in law go and get rhe keys as I ciuldnt mobe anywhere! Dont go to this location",negative
"If you like driving in trash filled, smoke stained, broke down cars and dealing horrible management than you will love this company. It was literally the worst customer experience I ever had. Anywhere. It took 2 hours to get me into a car. I tried two cars, both had garbage in them, were smoky with ashes and dust everywhere. I had to disinfect it myself before I left the lot. When I returned the car to the dealership where my car was being repaired (per their instructions) and handed in the keys I thought that would be the end of it. Almost two weeks later I found out they had been charging my bank account daily. It turns out they never went to pick it up from the dealership and instead of contacting me or the dealership, they just assumed I stole it. It just got worse from there. I was promised by the manager (Jared, Gerald??) my money would be refunded multiple times-it was not, he would call me back to let me know the situation was being corrected multiple times-he never called and every time I called him I was placed on hold for 10-30 minutes and he was extremely rude and unprofessional. I finally called corporate after 2 weeks and they refunded my money the next day. This place and its manager are a nightmare!",negative
"This branch is Hertz is disorganized and non responsive to customer. Car not clean, gas not full at renting, mischarging, refund delayed repeatedly, employee unpleasant... I wonder how soon it will be out of business, and I wonder if Hertz Headquarters even know the negative customer relationship the branch is creating everyday...or does it care?",negative
"I knew I was in trouble when they started calling me 2 days before my pickup date asking if I wanted to change the vehicle type. I reserved a minivan and they wanted to put me in a SUV. Then the morning of, they called again. I asked them flat out if there was going to be a minivan there or not. They said it was a busy holiday weekend for minivans, and they were trying to find one. There were 2 vans when I got there and both WERE DISGUSTING!!! Stained seats and floors, dents, scratches, you name it... Then a 3rd came in and SAME THING!!!! I took what I thought was the ""cleaner"" of the 3. IT HAD 60,000+ MILES!!!! AND I WAS GOING ON A 16 DAY 2,500+ MILE TRIP!!!! But it again was ""the better"" of the 3. Now the run down of the vehicle: 1.) the rear fold n go seat WOULD NOT FOLD.. 2.) the rear bench folded down, but had no strap to pull it back up 3.) The brakes made squealing and grinding noises, and were very weak 4.) Wipers needed replaced 5.) power steering fluid was below minimum 6.) radiator fluid at minimum 7.) found a iPhone 5s charger ( or did I ??) and an empty water bottle 8.) to go straight, the steering wheel had to be at 11 o'clock 9.) seats and carpet was stained... badly.. very badly.. like ""put a towel down"" bad 10.) scratches all over the outside So why would I take it ?!?!?! I HAD NO CHOICE !!!!!! I called around and no one had another minivan. I found out that you can book something on-line and the rental place will NOT have it, then will have to figure it out and please you somehow. Also, I have AAA and most cities we went to had a Hertz location just in case. NOW, they billed me for some BS tolls.. I have ALL my toll receipts ( cuz I felt this would happen) and have to fight with them. I didn't complain at first cuz I really did feel bad for the guys (not lady) who work there. PAY MORE, AND GO INTO THE SUBURBS AND GET A NEW, CLEAN, VEHICLE..",negative

Thanks!!",positive
"The best place to rent an RV! Great prices, clean and updated units and Philip and Michele were awesome. Will only be renting from them in the future!!",positive
"This was our first time renting an RV and the staff (Mitch) could not have been more helpful. The RV was fully stocked with all of the essentials we needed (pots & pans, cleaning supplies, etc). The prices were very fair and we enjoyed our week long trip in our RV.",positive
"We rented the Ford Majestic and had a majestic vacation!! Philip was very informative and helpful in our planning ahead of time. We had a great experience with Michele during our pick up, she was very descriptive with how everything works, and even so kind to respond to some late night text messages when we had a few questions! The RV had everything we needed and more!! Some previous renters had left some cooking essentials we forgot, and we too left some things that the next person may find their without. Philip was very timely with billing upon returning. We had a wonderful experience and look forward to using them again!",positive
"Excellent service, good prices, easy pick up and drop off. Reasonable charges for draining/filling/cleaning, if you opt to not do it yourself. Prompt response to calls. The only problem was with the electrical system, failed on the third day. Not their fault, and they handled it well. I highly recommend and will be renting from them again.",positive
"Awesome experience with this company. The RV we rented ""Majestic"" was very clean and well kept. There were no hidden charges and both Michelle and Phil provided excellent customer service. We will certainly rent from them again in the future.",positive
"Great Prices, Easy Rental, Easy contact during rental for extra explanations as needed. High quality equipment and Service. Will definitely come back to rent again!",positive
"I have to say that this company is awesome. Philip and his partner in Arizona, Michelle, were both so nice and helpful during our trip out West with our first RV rental. We had a great trip and though we had some issues that I consider normal with an RV, Philip just could not have been more available and helpful in getting them solved. There's not much more I can say really except that I think that these people obviously run their business with people's well-being in mind ....pretty rare these days but very nice to see.",positive
"For the most part our experience was ok. We rented the RV for a week in January. It was the first time we had rented an RV, and they were nice and spent time answering our questions. We rented the Chevy GulfStream. Having the linens and bath towels supplied was very helpful as was the easy living package. The RV itself was in decent condition. It was very clean. The sink in the bathroom seemed to leak which we didn't realize until we stopped, 4 hours from where we picked up the RV, but it was manageable. The blinds on the rear window that looked in on the bed didn't work, so we had to hang a sheet there to get some privacy. The RV drove fine however, so those were relatively minor concerns. We had a morning flight to catch so we dropped off the RV about a half hour before someone was going to be in the office. On the one hand, it was nice they offered this option. However, we came to regret it. We dropped off the RV in the same condition in which we had picked it. This was a little before 8 on a Saturday morning on a quiet street. Five days later, I first heard back from them with a final invoice charging us for a crack in the windshield. They sent a picture of the RV not in the same location in which we had dropped it off (it had been moved to a back parking lot) with the windshield cracked. There was definitely no crack or chip in the windshield when we dropped it off. Because we didn't turn it over to someone in person, though, and had no way to prove when that crack happened, they held us responsible and charged us to fix the windshield. This is why I gave them only 2 stars. If you're turning in the RV and someone is there to inspect it and hand the keys to, you're probably ok.",negative
"Very helpful and flexible. We had to wait to the last minute to book our RV. He was very accommodating. Great location near the airport. We were able to take a cab ride to the pick up location. We had the RV for a week, no problems at all.",positive
I recently rented and RV from Hightened Path and could not have been more pleased with the experience. I had never rented or driven an RV before and was not familiar with how they operated. The RV was in very good condition and Phil explained everything in detail and made the trip very easy. He let me know right off the bat that if I had any questions during my trip to feel free to contact him and he would help. He even returned some towels that we had left in the RV to our house!! Very good guy and company. Next time I need an RV I know exactly who I'm calling first,positive
"It's 3:30 AM. Why am I writing a yelp review at this ungodly hour? It would be because I can't sleep, even though I'm exhausted due to the ALL NIGHT ROAD CONSTRUCTION happening right outside my window. It's one thing to be right next to the highway. Traffic noise doesn't bother me- it's like white noise, especially late at night when roads aren't busy. But I've been listening to a jackhammer for at least three hours. Add in that the air conditioner in this room is as loud as the jackhammer outside. Rooms are clean and decor is up to date, but the last renovation should have included newer windows to block the noise and updated A/C's. This property should at the VERY LEAST warn guests about ongoing roadwork happening right outside the hotel at night. It might not be under their control, but they are located right next to the highway, and I assume people come here to sleep. Electric outlet right next to my bed also doesn't work- real pain in the youknowwhat. Otherwise friendly staff, clean rooms and within walking distance to so much in the area.",negative
"Ok, stayed two weeks initially. Internet sucks. Clean, friendly, good location. Parking charge $23 a night no valet, uncovered outside parking. I stay for work. Some good people though, during the day seems fine. Security in parking lot leaves before morning. Low rating because internet shuts off constantly. It took three attempts and twenty minutes to post this review Expensive, as far as IHG goes. Due to location.",negative
"Not cheap at all. Called for the free shuttle, which was a benefit of getting the room and the shuttle never showed; Very Disappointing. I wouldn't book here again unless I was with family with young kids. Just not worth the price of admission.",negative
Stayed here for a weekend getaway with the family. If we come back to Pittsburgh again we will definitely stay here. Staff was very friendly.,positive
"I have stayed here a few times when visiting the North Shore for different events. The people are always friendly and the room always comfortable and clean. You have to pay for parking, but the lot is right next to the hotel and very convenient. We came down early in the day to attend a football game and was able to park in the lot before our room was ready. The shuttle service offered is also nice and complimentary for a 3 mile radius of the hotel. The location is great for a Pirate or Steeler game or any other North Shore event.",positive
"If I could give them negative stars I would. Military traveling on orders. They double charged my personal bank account instead of the government travel card. I called and they agreed to fix it. Here is what really gets me. They sent a refund to my government travel card, leaveing my personal bank account $680.00 short. I will never stay here again and I will never go back to Pittsburgh, PA.",negative
"We loved this place. We were in Pittsburgh for a 3 day weekend, with plans to go to 2 Pirates baseball games at PNC Park. If your looking for a place to stay near PNC Park, you can't beat this place. Rooms are great. Big, and very clean. Beds are great. Bathroom is big with great shower. The complimentary breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. They have laundry facilities on the 4th and 8th floor. The only thing you might find disappointing is the very small pool and workout rooms. But we weren't there to swim. Its a 1 block walk to the ballpark. A block filled with fun restaurants and bars. Makes for fun pre-game and post-game partying. One of the days, the game was a 4pm start. After the game, we had dinner at one if the restaurants. Then, we took a very nice walk across the Roberto Clemente Bridge, and over to the Golden Triangle park. A great 3 day stay. Thank you to all the great employees too.",positive
"Janelle was super accommodating and should be promoted. Rooms were nice but breakfast was pretty weak. All was well, though.",positive
"We stayed here a week before Christmas while attending a wedding at a nearby venue. Our queen double room was clean, beds were comfortable, large bathroom with a bath tub and gigantic light-up vanity mirror, which made applying make up and getting ready for the wedding a breeze. The hotel and staff in general are very pleasant and nice. Breakfast was free and had some decent choices - from oatmeal, pancakes, cereals, omelettes to fresh fruit, yogurts, bagels etc. I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the parking situation confusion : on the reservation confirmation it says that one parking spot per room is included in hotel's parking lot. However, once we got there, we were told that we have to pay to park there $20/per night. Unfortunately no street parking was available and we had no choice other than to park there and pay. That was the only downside of our otherwise pleasant stay at this hotel.",positive
Very nice hotel. New and clean and very nice. We showed up early and yet they still let us check in. Within walking distance of everything and staff was extremely friendly. Right next to the stadium and a ton of restaurants. Would definitely recommend.,positive
"Clean, updated and very spacious rooms. The staff is friendly and the location is great. It is right across from the Pirates stadium with lots of bars and restaurants right around it. If you are saying in Pittsburgh I would definitely recommend staying here.",positive
We showed up 2 hours early and they had a room ready for us. Great location off the left-field gates of PNC Park. All the staff were friendly and the room was impeccably clean. Thank you for a good night's stay.,positive
"Great location and nice staff. The jake brakes from the trucks traveling the overpass like 20 yards from my room kept me up most of the night--between that and the often blinking smoke alarm, this is one of the least restful hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Maybe ask to have a room far away from the overpass.",negative
I really can't express how wonderful this hotel is. We showed up several hours early and instead of turning us away they hustled to get a room ready for us. The rooms are really nice and modern. The hotel is right across the street from PNC Park and seems to be a pretty safe area. The hotel staff was extremely professional and kind. This hotel is also doing great work for the community and for that they should be highly commended.,positive
"Big thank you to Nicole for helping me out this morning! I called about a canceled rewards night stay and she was so helpful and sweet! You are very lucky to have her!

"I love this hotel. We just arrived and the place is brand new! The lobby and public areas are very nice, rooms are completely new with modern touches and designed for the new age travelers. Wifi is fast, electric outlets very well located with USB connections available besides your bed and in the computer table. A 43"" LED TV, microwave and fridge are also very convenient. The personnel is also lovely. Definitely a place to come back in a family trip!",positive
"This Holiday Inn is just so-so; not horrible by any means but nothing like the large number of really nice hotels in the chain. Some of the issues: (1) The hotel is old and dated, in need of a refresh. (2) You have to pay an extra $15 per day parking. Many travelers out of the nearby airport pay to park here, so you will most likely not find a parking spot near the front door. In fairness, though, I should point out that there are multiple entrances to the hotel, so you can enter someplace near your car. (3) The hotel has a Perkins restaurant attached for dining in or ordering room service, so you know what you are getting. However, the food is not as good as that at other Perkins where I have eaten (4) Not the fault off the hotel, but the neighborhood is not that great, so you have to drive to find a decent place to eat. If this hotel is the best one for your budget, then you just have to make the best of a so-so situation.",negative
"Not recommended unless you get a voucher. Lets be clear, the shuttle is supposed to run every 45 min, it doesn't. Closer to 1h25 min! The hotel does an exchange with Air Canada where they only pay something like $45/night so if you miss your flight with Air Canada and its their fault, don't be surprised to be staying here. However, if I'm on my own dime, I wouldn't stay here. The rooms are OK, better than I expected given the bad service and attitude from the lady that picked us up at the airport. It is very loud though.",negative
"This place is dark and dated, which you have to look beyond to realize that the room is actually pretty clean, even if the stuffing from the mattress in my room was starting to come out. The blackout curtains were also starting to let the light in. I seemed to have hatched a 2 km pokemon egg walking from the front desk to my room--it was pretty far from the front desk to the elevator, no kidding. Also, my room number was not even included on the sign that points you in the direction of where it's at. (See my photo.) There were also tall high voltage metal towers in the parking lot, if you are concerned about that type of thing. The hotel seemed to be directly below the path of the airplanes. (I didn't notice the noise at other nearby hotels that I've stayed at.) There's an onsite restaurant that is average but all you need when you just want to stay put and get ready for your plane ride home. I was surprised at the cost of the hotel room for the quality, which included a $15 charge for parking. If you like new, modern and light, and need good internet or gps connection, there are a lot of hotels in the area and in areas close by that will probably meet more of your needs for the same price or less.",negative
"First of all I would like to say that no one in the front desk answers calls. I even in fact reached the hotline to get someone to contact the hotel's front desk. No, they are not busy because it's almost midnight. And the customer service agent even said that it's very unusual. We got to the hotel after waiting for an hour for the shuttle bus. At the front desk, there wasn't the usual greeting for their rewards member which was fine because we need a room. The room was OK the mattress seemed like it has seen better days though. No ref, safe or microwave but there is a coffemaker. We were hungry and thirsty. Unfortunately, room service is closed. I went to the vending machine to get something to drink as there was no complimentary water. The machine said ""Sold Out"". Went to the next floor and the same. Went to the another floor and it was the same, again! Sold Out! Does anybody really check their stocks? We called the front desk and of course after a series of tries finally someone picked it up. We asked if they have water at least as we were in need of one. They said go to the vending machine. But I said it's not working. She said get to another floor and I said I tried 3 floors and they were all the same. Sold Out! I just asked again if they have water and if they can spare us a couple. Thankfullynshe said yes and they send it our way. The bottled water arrived. They were expired!!! Expired Jan 2017. No it wasn't manufactured then it was manufactured Jan 2016. I called the front desk but this time in just 2 tries. I told them the water expired 6 months ago. After some pleading she said she will send us another bottle of water. And we ended the night there. The following morning, we went to the restaurant. There were a line of people waiting to be seated. I asked somebody for the host and he said he's coming. The host came after 5 mins and I remember I saw him talking and laughing with another waiter. If I did not catch his attention we would still be standing waiting to be seated. We were seated and then again another long wait. I asked somebody who is our waiter and he called him out. We gave our order immediately as we were hungry since the night before. Then our food was served. I noticed other tables were being served coffee and we didn't have any. I asked a waitress for coffee and she said she will tell our waiter even though she had a coffee pot in her hands. Oh well nothing great to talk about in that restaurant anyway. We were probably unlucky in that trip. We went back to our room passed bybtje front desk which is empty. And you wonder why no one answers the phone.",negative
We had the great pleasure of scheduling an event with Tasha in Catering. She did a wonderful job of scheduling and working with our teams to put on a successful event. The hotel is easy to fine - airport and worth the price. Our events team was very pleased with the room and the staff and we will definitely be returning. 5 Stars!,positive
"Very unimpressed with this hotel. Apart from the lobby area it looks tired and dated. The rooms have seen better days and the air conditioning units are so loud you'll get more peace sleeping at the threshold of the nearby runways. The constant drowning and rattling is difficult to ignore and hear yourself think over, but are necessary as the rooms become like a sauna in the summer heat without it switched on. There is an indoor pool available to guests, but no hotub. The pool itself is really a large vat of bleach, the overwhelming stench as you walk down the corridor to the pool burns your eyes and is unacceptably unpleasant. The hotel charges $15 a day for parking, although do offer park-and-fly rates where they say you can leave your car for up to 8days as part of the package. However, what they don't tell you is that just hours after you board their shuttle to the airport, they'll slap a $60 ticket on your car as a nice welcome back present when you return from your trip. As for the shuttle bus, it's easy enough to utilize from the hotel to the airport, but don't rely on it to get back if you fly into Terminal One. I duly went to the spot advised for pick up, waited over an hour with no show, so made my way over to the Terminal Three pillar. 40 minutes later the shuttle showed up, and again skipped Terminal One to head back to the hotel. I queried this with the driver who just ignored my question without response, but did point very suggestively to his tip-jar as I disembarked!",negative
So far one of the beat holiday inns i have stayed at. Long walk to the elevators but there are quite a few entrances closer to the elevators. I like the fact that they have rooms with patio access. Will deff stay here again.,positive
"This Hotel, isn't that good, they charge you for everything nothing is complementary. it's room are not so good the lobby may be nice but I assure you the rooms aren't. The only thing that is complementary is the Wi-Fi, I think it's because they have a pool and a Gamer Room, but if your in really desperate need come here but if you need Luxury don't come here.",negative
Great place to stay. Very comfortable beds and soft towels. Perkins is a friendly restaurant with competent service and lots of comfort food. Pool was well maintained. Good place for pick up to meetings farther west,positive
For the money that you pay is not wort take a look of the pic that I post they are doing a renew so will be better eventually As well you have to pay 14$ For parking,negative
"These recent heat waves were no joke. When I arrived in Toronto last week, the temperature was 98¬∞F. I checked into a Holiday Inn there, where I had prepaid reservations via Hotels.com. I walk down a hall that is literally the length of a casino floor to get to the elevator. Carrying all of my luggage, I started getting warm. I was okay with this, knowing that as soon as I get to my room, a blast of AC would cool me down. When I got to my room though, it was even warmer than the halls I had hiked through. I checked the thermostat and confirmed it was set to COOL and cranked it down to its lowest setting, a chilly 15¬∞C (59¬∞F). Although I heard an ambient hum coming from the vents, there was no AC coming out. I called the front desk and asked them to send maintenance to check it out. They were surprised I was having problems. About an hour later, an older gentleman comes to the door and explains that there are two centralized AC units to cool the entire facility and only one of them is working. There was essentially nothing he could do, nor was there anything I could do, since my booking was prepaid. When I checked out, I explained to the staff that the condition of the room was unreasonable, and apparently the shift had changed and everyone now is well aware of the still uncorrected issue. As a sign of goodwill, they offered me a complimentary breakfast, but I was on my way to the airport (a plate of scrambled eggs, is hardly compensation for this). ___________________ Notes: * I'm totally willing to overlook the fact that the elevator broke later that evening and that I had to take the stairs to and from the 4th floor. * Gift shop is in a weird location and has weird hours (doesn't open until 3PM).",negative
"This place is too expensive for what it offers, but I guess the sane can be said for most hotels in this area. Thanks again Pearson, as if your airport taxes are not high enough. On a positive note the rooms are fairly modern, clean and a decent size",negative
"I would highly recommend staying here. I took my daughter and 2 grand kids for a 2 day stay and was very pleased with room and was treated very pleasantly by ALL staff members. I did my normal gambling and even though the casino seemed ""small"" it had enough machines to keep me entertained. We had several meals which was reasonably priced and was delicious. We had a nice view and the room was clean, beds were comfortable. The kids loved the shower! We took them to wet and wild which was only 30 mins away. We had a blast. If their happy, I'm happy. Over all, had a wonderful couple days.",positive
"My family and I recently fell on hard times. This hotel offers an employee discount for its employees to stay in the hotel. My daughter and brother both work for this company so we used the employee discount in order to stay here a few weeks while looking for a more permanent solution to our issues. At the time we checked in there was a great manager named Jamie who absolutely helped us out. She has since left the company and I now see why. After she left the place went to shit! We were no longer treated like valued guest. We ate in every restaurant they had paid for our rooms up front and were not a problem to anyone. Yet my lady was locked inside the pool area, my daughter (an employee) was harassed by 1 particular security guard every day. We were gossiped about because I'm a member of a motorcycle club and wanted to park my bike in a lighted area in front of the building. Mind you we've spent almost 2000.00 in this hotel between rooms, gambling, and food. This place has the worst guest service I have ever seen. DO NOT STAY HERE. Oh and they have scorpions in the hallways, bees in the hot tub, bugs in the light fixtures.",negative
"Brought the family to see Hoover Dam, and decided to stay a night at Hoover Dam Lodge, what a great decision it turned out to be, the front receptionist Kaylee was extremely polite, answered all my questions and gave me the correct directions on how to get to dam and told me not to follow rhe GPS directions, I would end up in a dead end or in the lake iteself. The room was very clean, even had a lil snack basket with goodies (bite sized candys) which my kids devoured, we had a great view of Lake Mead from our window, but what impressed me the most was the room did NOT smell like cigarette, aside from the temperature being hot as hell ( it was so hot it made James Brown) my family and I had a great stay at Hoover Dam Lodge, my kids enjoyed the pool and the grub at Big Horn Cafe was excellent",positive
Just had brunch in cafe. Very solid ham/egg dish. Ham actually hickory smoked and sourdough actually sour. Good portion of hash browns as well. Stylish restaurant.,positive
Very comfortable and welcoming. Easy access to the dam and hiking. Breakfast at the cafe in hotel was delicious and they accommodated our dietary needs with a smile.,positive
"Checked in after long backpacking trip and just wanted to take a shower... got in the shower in my room and turned around to find a visitor in the shower with me, a nice cockroach hanging out on the shower curtain. I quickly finished and called the front desk, they told me they were going to ""send someone."" to do what I have no idea, so I asked for another room. They gave me a smaller room and when the maintenance guy showed up to give me the keys and check out my extra guest he tried to tell me it was a ""stain."" Good thing I had already taken a picture to know the truth. Definitely the worst part about the experience was how the staff made me feel bad, like I had done something wrong. Since there was really no where else to stay in the area and it was super late, we just got the room on a higher floor and hoped we didn't bring any extra creatures home with us. I will be washing all my items that I brought into this hotel before I put them away in my house. If you can, I would find somewhere, ANYWHERE else to stay.",negative
The Bighorn Cafe is great! All meals! Everyone at this entire lodge are unbelievable . I have never met so many friendly workers. Very laid back and every is very helpful . Rooms are clean and affordable. The view of the mountains .... Awesome!!!!!! I would recommend the lodge and the Bighorn Cafe to everyone. The workers in the gift shop are so helpful and kind.,positive
This place is great!!! -close to the Hoover Dam -nice room -complementary snacks -cool gift shop -good restaurants A GREAT VALUE!!! (but we were really bummed out that pool and Jacuzzi were closed for the season),positive
"This is probably the nicest place to stay in Boulder City. It's old and the rooms could use updating, but it is clean, well maintained and the closest room you can rent to Hoover Dam. I didn't set out to see the dam but was passing by on the way out of Las Vegas and ended up staying long enough that I needed a room for the night. . The staff is friendly, helpful and have the small town charm that I am somewhat surprised to see so close to Las Vegas. The casino is broken down into several smaller rooms. I assume they are operated by the same owner, but they appear to be separate businesses, each with their own theme, dining options, music, and decor. All games are video based except for one classic slot machine. No dealers. There are also arcade games and a pinball machine for the kids. There are historical photos and displays of Hoover dam and a short documentary of it's construction. You can also see the video on the hotel channel in your room. The food in the restaurant is basic, but good and priced right. My room had a view of lake Mead and of the Helicopter tour company located at the opposite end of the parking lot. Like I mentioned, the room could use updating, maroon carpet, floral wallpaper header, linoleum bathroom floor, out of date furniture etc, but it was clean and nothing was broken. The TV and refrigerator we're newer. The TV looked like a 50 inch LCD. Not too many channels though, basic cable, and the input signal was definitely not HD. In my experience, hotel refrigerators never get cold enough, so I adjusted to max cold. By morning all my water froze to ice. +1 for the fridge! You can also expect complimentary snacks and water in your room. The bed was co.fortable but that is personal preference. The fitness center was nicer than most hotels. Everything was modern and in good repair. Two treadmills, two ellipticals, rubberized dumbbells from 5 to 75 lbs, one flat and two adjustable benches, a V shaped weight stack machine with all the attachments so you can get your cable crossovers on, and newer yoga mats...Incase you don't like GAINS! J/K. It's not LA Fitness, it's a hotel. If you can't get a pump here, you don't really want to work out. The pool is seasonal and was closed during my stay. I can tolerate an out of date room for cleanliness and security, but I thought the price was a bit much. I paid half as much for a room at Treasure Island in Las Vegas the night before and that's only about 30 minutes away. Still, I like the place and I might stay here again if I return.",positive
Needs remodeling badly. Rooms are Very outdated. Everything dates back to the 80s. Not satisfied. We would have gone on into Vegas if we'd known it was like it is.,negative
"I always wanted to stay here and i finally did- My October 2017 stay here was pretty awesome and i'll fill you in without further interruption CHECK IN: The person behind the desk had someone watching over her shoulder so i assume she was new. It took 2 minutes longer than usual to get my keys and be on my way but it wasn't that bad. All my questions were answered to my satisfaction. ROOMS: I really recommend the Deluxe room (not the standard) It was clean, recently updated, had a large refrigerator and had a microwave (yep you read correctly) They included a complimentary snack basket in your room which i've never seen at any other hotel (Nice touch!) The shower was very large & modern and the bed was very comfortable. I think about any room you get in this hotel will offer a spectacular view. Note- When you book you have the option of renting a mountain bike for the trails behind the hotel.....i totally recommend it. They are Mongoose bikes in pretty good shape. POOL: Pool is open until 11pm, the hot tub was needed after a long day of biking. DINING: The Bighorn Cafe had one of the best burgers I have had in awhile (No BS). The decor is cozy (like a lodge) and they broke up the Casino into several different themed rooms like New Orleans theme and a Mexican theme with the corresponding type of food and drinks at each. GIFT SHOP: The store was large and offered everything at reasonable prices (for a change). I was incredibly happy to be here and can't wait to go back and look at the view.",positive
"This place has changed. We have been staying here since it was the gold strike and most everything that has come after that hotel has been good when it comes to our family trips. This time around we right off the bat heard of a boat and truck being stolen from the property our first night. That next morning the staff wasn't sure what had happened and didn't have any plans for securing the lot further to prevent this from happening again and was downplaying the event. Worrying about our truck and boat getting stolen and lack of hotel support created some tension. The room keys were constantly being demagnetized and on 4 different occasions we had to go down and get room keys just so we can get back in our room. The lady at the front desk said they are old room keys and demagnetize easy. The price has significantly increased yet nothing really has changed the rooms still look the same and the service is worse. The hotel operations manager was gonna check on discounting our rooms or doing something to offset some of these issues, and she didn't ! We also called the dottis phone # to speak with someone about this issue. The dottis phone # went straight to a voicemail and we haven't received a phone call back. This hotel won't disclose if there's been a high rate of theft and won't do anything about it, and they won't take care of there customers they would rather avoid it. I don't know if we will stay here again, it's been 27 years.",negative
The bartenders are really friendly and the people are nice front desk little bit more work overall we all had a good time I love going there the in the rooms work clean can't wait till next year the casino is different but nice,positive
We decided to stay here on our way back from Grand Cayon to go see the Hoover damn. It seems like a nice hotel from outside. When I get to the room it is hot went to front desk they said would send someone they arrive to check it and says it is because it is hot outside so until sun goes down it will cool this was at 8. Then we try to watch TV and the 8 channels are fuzy called to have someone look at it he comes in and says this is better than other rooms says nothing we can do. Then asked about ac again since it is 9:30 and no cooling has occurred says it is blowing cold air just needs to cool walls first. Will not come back if you are around go check the little hotels in Boulder if need to stay around prob cheeper and same quality can't go lower. Will not be returning!!!!!!,negative
"Decent price, animals welcome (no extra fee mentioned but i haven't left yet so we will see. (Paid $79 dollars a night, unless they charged for our puppy) the hotel room was large with a nice bed, huge TV, excellent A/C, clean, good towels and soap, decent shower, microwave, fridge, iron, etc. This place has a pool and spa, the pool was nice to swim in, the spa was lower than the jets, luke warm, and just sort of lame. The hotel is connected to a casino area, and a few individual restaurants that have their own casino games in them. It also has a general store and a bar. I could see this being a fun place for some drinking a gambling. We played a couple hours of slots, got some pretty bad food then called it a night. Went to their gym in the morning, amd as far as hotel gyms go this one was one od the best I've been to. Free weights amd cardio equipment, not amazing but can get the job done. Easy parking, affordable, clean, friendly staff, fun games, bad food (at least one restaurant was) I would stay here again if i were out here already and needed a place to crash.",positive
Stacy at the front desk who also takes reservations is Awesome! She is so pleasant and warm having a great personality. Ask for her and you will be made to feel welcome and taken care of!,positive
Stay clear of the Bourbon Street Casino inside this hotel. Our food came out burnt and wasn't edible whatsoever. We were refused any refund or even substitutions. No apology either. We paid cash money for absolutely nothing. Unbelievable. Asked quite of few employees around the hotel and there's nothing they can do. I wouldn't stay here if they comped me.,negative
"I think it is too expensive for what it provides for us. Carpet was so dirty and some furniture pieces were missing. Above all, mattress was sinking and the sheet didnt feel clean. I wish we had had more options around the area.",negative
Worst hotel stay ever. Toilet would not flush at times (had to lift lid and manually flush...eww!) TV was static coffee maker was for disposable cups but normal coffee packets were supplied so not functional. Carpet was heavily stained and felt crunchy under feet. Shower was a trickle. Called down several times and nothing done. Was out and about most of the two days we were there and when returned nothing had been done to fix issues. Basically rented a bed! When I checked out and told them issues again response was a blank look. I said that I wasn't asking for a refund just wanted to let them know issues before they booked someone else in it. They said ok. No apologies or customer service efforts. Front desk was rude and short when I called during stay. The casino and main floor was nice but the room was ridiculous. Beware!,negative
Nice clean room and great service. Close to lake Mead and the Hoover dam. Has everything we need! Definitely coming back!,positive
"Nice clean rooms. They left us little snacks everyday! The cafe was really good too. Everyone is so friendly there. Christine in the gift shop, the bus lady who speaks German in the cafe, the night bartender/cashier, that poor girl does everything with a smile on her face!!",positive
"I was told there is internet. There was not. They claim there is, but its weak to non existent. Pulled this out of a desk girl (I don't really know why, mostly no internet.) I dislike being lied to here. Ice machines ever other floor, had to do a hunt for. The hot water bleeds into the cold water, as a plumber I know the fix, so cold water always warm. Positive side, the back restaurant is always good, I had same waiter as last year. Been here 3 times, From now on,well no more. I really needed internet.",negative
"Rooms were exactly what we expected for the price we paid, front desk was friendly and helpful. Hillary on the bar is fantastic. Great to talk with, fast, funny and helpful. 5 stars for Hillary.",positive
"Just a short trip from the Hoover Dam you will find this hotel. The outside is nice. Upon arrival our family wasn't aware there was a casino attached. We arrived at 2pm to check in after we toured the Hoover Dam, come to find out check in is at 4pm. My husband went in to get our room key and was told that kids are not allowed anywhere near the casino area and had to come in through the lobby and straight up to the room. Okay no problem, I went in with the kids and the place smelled like smoke entering the lobby again no problem, but I don't like the smell of cig. Smoke at all! Our room was on the 5th floor so we headed to the elevator and ascended to the 5th floor. Elevator doors open and the heat in the hallway hits you like a furnace ...they really need to do something about that. We enter the room and was suprised it was so large. 2 king size beds, small couch huge bathroom with dressing area. The ac was not on in the room so it was really hot...it did take a while for the room to cool off because the curtains were slightly open with the Arizona sun shining brightly in. Giving this hotel a 3 star review because of the smoke, lack of kid/teen choices, and the heat issue. Beds are comfy and if you want to gamble there are many opportunities to do just that.",negative
"We stopped in for breakfast. Beautiful place. Lori, our waitress, was wonderful. Service was great. The food is not fresh. Chicken Fried Steak is a frozen patty and the hash browns may also be frozen. The bacon, although tasty, was very greasy.",negative
Great place BUT no internet. If you don't have Verizon your out of luck. You have to go outside to connect to your regular service. Unreal.,negative
"Great location, had everything you need right on property. Rooms are clean and updated, they have a rustic theme. View from lake view room wasn't very impressive though and no balcony. Smells like smoke when you first walk in but once you get past that it's nice. Steakhouse was closed on Tuesday night(???) but front desk directed us to a good restaurant in town.",positive
"Didn't stay but I did play! Out by Hoover Dam, this little casino and lodge is really dam great. Decorated in semi-modernized frontier lodge wood and stone, it never felt claustrophobic. Service is fantastic. Belly up to the bar and ask Beth for a drink. She can sling a powerful and tasty beverage. She made a martini that could subdue a charging rhino, very potent and dirty with olives . If you are driving to Vegas, stop here. The little gift shop is a rare treasure chest of liquor, less than $10 for 750ml of Pinnacle Vodka, just to name one. Sports is always on the TVs in the bar. I'd definitely consider staying here but will surely stop here for alcohol before driving into Las Vegas. Get the player's club card, even if you don't plan on coming back. I can't wait to try the food, mountain bike the trails, slide on a cable over the gorge, and get out on the lake. It's a vacation from the vacation. There are even Grand Canyon helicopter flights from the back door of this place, surprisingly fun.",positive
"Great lodge! Affordable price for a weekend, 30 minutes from Vegas! Staff was very friendly, gave us bottles of water when we checked in at 2AM.",positive
"Stayed here on 9/18/15 and I must say it was a very pleasant surprise, especially for paying under $100! After a very long day in Vegas we arrived to the lodge around 2 am & were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist who made checking in a breeze and even threw in free water bottles! There is a 24 hr guest store as well as a yummy diner. The room is a little outdated but was very clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting lake mead/ hoover dam!",positive
"Probably the nicest hotel (in Canada) I've ever stayed in. Maid service is great, front desk staff are way more approachable, room service and the bar are great, and very nicely decorated.",positive
"The Novotel in Vaughan is a newer hotel. We had debated staying at the Novotel or Aloft (both of which are in close proximity to the Vaughan Mills Mall). We definitely were pleased with our choice. The hotel was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was especially nice as there is a bathtub, standard shower head and removable shower head (amenities you don't often find in a hotel). Staff were courteous and prompt. The cost for our Superior 2-queen room was extremely reasonable given the size and comfort of the room. While not a luxury hotel, it is an excellent hotel that offers many luxury features at a reasonable price. Pros: Large rooms, comfortable beds, extremely clean, easy checkout and check-in, close to shopping, not far from Toronto, easily accessible from 400 highway Cons: None I would highly recommend Novotel Vaughan. Excellent service, wonderful rooms and an overall great experience.",positive
"Clean, modern hotel and cordial staff. A bit outcast from the action but I stayed at this branch to be close to a business meeting. They have one downtown that I have not tried yet. Food in the restaurant in the lobby was great as well. It was also close to the international airport. I am definitely going back.",positive
Astrid did a great job with our bookings for our Wedding Guests. The general manager was excellent at responding to questions. The hotel is in a great location near many fun things to do. Happy we booked our group of 14 rooms there for our wedding.,positive
"The hotel is new, gorgeous and in really great shape. I however care about service and understand certain norms and have 3 complaints: 1) The RFID keycard didn't work on the door. (Trust me I know how they work). I went back down and used the wrong word in my half asleep state. ""Well ma'am, the cards don't swipe, you hold them over the lock"" the guy said. Then I watched him reactive the card and go ""it says card active, I'll come up with you do you know how it works"". NO SINGLE FEMALE WANTS A LYING MALE TO ACCOMPANY HER TO HER ROOM!!! I was too tired and couldn't be bothered to argue. We went up, he opened the door for me without actually bothering to 'show me how it works' and I entered my giant beautiful room. 2) There was no water in the room. I don't care if it's paid or complimentary, but two bottles of water in a hotel room is the standard. I had zero. 3) I did not have my doubts not disturb sign on the door, but I was only here for one night. Housekeeping was knocking on my door at 10:20 AM while I was in the shower. Again, very invasive experience for someone that is used to not being disturbed until she checks out on the day that she is checking out. 4) I turned the Air Conditioning off but it kept going. I called the front desk to see if they had an override on, the guy had no idea what I was talking about, so I unplugged it instead. 5) There was shampoo, body wash, 2 bars of soap, and make up remover wipes.... But no body lotion or hair conditioner. What female washes her hair without hair conditioner? The hotel is great, but I'd probably stay at Aloft next door a where I know that the service is consistent and protocols are in place.",negative
"We checked in last min and even though my husband called for a price while we were in the parking lot, when we went inside we were told they sold that room. After a manager came out they did some rearranging and got us all fixed up with a better room then initially + free buffet breakfast. Service so far has been great wnd the room is beautiful. So far the only has been the pool is a bit cold :)",positive
"First time staying at a Novotel (I usually stay with Hilton or Marriott) and I'm glad I did! Lobby is stylish and welcoming, check in was a breeze with friendly staff. I got a room with a king bed and as soon as I walked in I was in love. Nothing special but your regular bed, desk and other furniture but something about the colors and clean lines made everything look better. The bathroom was clean and modern as well. They had soap, shampoo, body wash and, pleasantly surprised, make up remover wipes. Free wifi and breakfast buffet with plenty of options for about $130/weeknight, you can't beat that! Hotel restaurant/lounge is superb as well. Located near the Vaughn Mills mall. Did not get a chance to check it out but heard there are plenty of stores for everyone. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in the area.",positive
"PRETTY GOOD place to stay. The restaurant is better than it looks! Rooms, etc., no complaints. Convenient to freeways, too.",positive
"The rooms are big and comfortable, everything is always clean and the parking is included. However, the Wifi is absolutely horrible. Being on business, I needed access to the internet. The internet there was useless, even at the reception! I had to go to Tim Horton's to use the Wifi.",negative
"Very, very nice hotel. The family and I loved staying here. Modern and fancy. Friendly and attentive staff, cozy rooms, and the beds are extremely comfortable. Rooms are quiet, we never heard any other guests during out time there. The breakfast buffet is a must, lots of fresh and delicious selections. Pool and hot tub are nice little bonuses. Only gripe would be that while the bathrooms in the rooms are very modern and stylish, the doors have frosted glass panels and light up the entire room when the light is on.",positive
"I have stayed at 4* hotels that are not as nice as this. It is really a 3.5 or a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price. The rooms are modern and very comfortable and the location is great (steps from Vaughan Mills mall and a two minute drive to Canada's Wonderland). I am very, very impressed with this hotel and their courteous staff. Would definitely stay again and feel very comfortable recommending it to others. I have read some comments that the pool is too small, but I have to disagree. I spent quite a bit of time in the pool and It looks like your standard 12x24 ft. pool. The hot tub is also a nice bonus. The hotel exceeded all my expectations, which is always a pleasant surprise.",positive
"Great hotel! Very clean, friendly and fast service, spacious rooms, comfy beds, modern fixtures, good food, spotty wifi (at least in my room. A colleague of mine, staying down the hall, had full strength wifi).",positive
"Great little property, VERY, VERY clean. Easy in/out, great employees. Comfy bed. TV had lots of channels, including American. Restaurant is good, too. Attended an event in the meeting space, which was OUTSTANDING! Much better than most small hotels, this was a city-class event. Really great food and beverage, and LOTS of it. No nickel and diming at this hotel. I wish I could plop this little property into every city I visit. How did the reception girl remember my name the whole time?? Every time I went past the desk, she would say ""Hi Ms ----"" Nice young girl. The location is great, too. I didn't go to the outlet mall but I hit up all the Canadian grocery stores to bring home. There is a Costco nearby, a Highland, Loblaws and a fantastic Real Canadian not too far away.",positive
"What a marvellous hotel. I've stayed here twice on business and both experiences have been first rate. The beds are divinely comfortable, the rooms are sleek and a little upscale. Best of all is the staff -- friendly, professional and helpful. Excellent wifi, a first class dining room and swimming pool and fitness centre round out the amenities. This is now my standard place to stay north of Toronto.",positive
"This resort is SO impressive! I can't imagine another one in the area being nicer but I'm not really sure if that's the case. My girlfriends and I came for a friend's B-Day weekend and we wanted a nice pool area and spa. First of all the customer service person Dasha was so amazing! She was so nice and helpful and helped me coordinate flowers, snacks, champagne and happy birthday banner and balloons to be in the room for when my GF got into her room! It started the whole weekend off perfectly and I truly appreciate the effort they made to help me do that. Our room was right on the lake and that made for a really nice atmosphere so if you can secure that I highly recommend it! We only left the resort in the evening for dinner and the bar/nightlife scene. The pool area is massive and super gorgeous with skinny little waterfalls coming off of the upper cement level area, where all the flowers were and made for a very pretty scene. There were bougainvillea flowers everywhere that would fall into the pool area we were in and made it truly magical (I'm a flower person) and made for some great photo opps! They have an adult pool which I thought we would prefer but there are areas in the other pool, toward the back near the lake, that we found that were very private and perfect for chilling on our Unicorn and Wine bottle floaty rafts. Yea we were those girls! I thought it was going to be too hot to be at the pool but the area we were at had a cement staircase near us and under it was the perfect amount of shade where we could hang in the pool and be in the shade which was super nice! The lounge area at the hotel was really nice that was like an indoor/outdoor vibe and there were great drinks and bites and some great live music. They have a gondola ride on the lake that looked nice but we didn't have a chance to do that. Too busy lounging at the pool! :-) Overall the vibe was very upscale, relaxing and social. I am looking forward to going back and taking my husband, kid and I think my parents would love it too! Highly recommend!",positive
"Just some thoughts from our experience: Pros: staff is friendly enough, resort is clean, the sand entry pool is great for small children. Breakfast and the breakfast buffet was good at the bistro. Specialty coffee drinks on site. Nice little ""made in AZ"" section for travelers to buy locally made gifts. Great assortment of programming- activities for kids, live music, etc. hard to find on their website though. Cons: Parking and resort fee is sort of high. Both check-in and check-out took a long time for just a few people in line. Room service food was on the same level as fast food, so not worth the money. The TV offered in room movies for $19! Most hotels just let you stream your Netflix and apps these days. Poolside lemonade was $7 and poolside nachos not worth it. Also, being vegetarian there's basically nothing to eat in the hotel except salad or a quesadilla- and if vegan then really slim choices. Also would like to see some more green initiatives- more recycle bins at the least.",negative
"Such a beautiful property! It truly captures the best of Arizona landscape. If it hadn't been 115 degrees, I would love to walk around the property more. Check-in was a great process. I was there around 11am and was able to get a room before attending the conference. I definitely took advantage of the Desert Rose complimentary drink. The staff was very helpful in recommending what activities were available. I've never stayed at a hotel where there were so many pool options! I made a point to get pool time in around my conference and played in the adult pool and waterslide the most. Our room had a great view overlooking the lagoon. On Friday night, I could hear the guests at the adult pool (having a great time) right up until closing at 11pm. I was sitting out on the patio and didn't hear anything in my room. In passing, I enjoyed the live music. The conference facilities and food were good. I certainly did not go hungry or thirsty. I would highly recommend this property.",positive
"This has always been my favorite resort in the Phoenix area. As we live in the area, our daughter grew up with many memories of our visits to this resort. It is amazing. That being said, now there is a $21 parking fee along with the $30 resort fee. I can't believe I'm being asked to pay to park in an asphalt lot. One would think this was a downtown Chicago parking garage. I'm sick and tired of places that choose to ""nickel and dime"" customers for every penny they can get. I work DAMN hard for my money, and I don't appreciate any business that tries to take advantage of that. I have always recommended this resort, I never will again. It's sad that I will not return. But, these resorts know they can get away with charging these ridiculous fees, they know people will pay. I will not. I will take my hard earned business to the WigWam resort which is also amazing. And, they don't charge people to park their cars....yet.",negative
"Views: First, let's start with the view. This 5-star resort hotel has spacious open areas both indoors and outdoors with views of the Sonoran desert and the McDowell Mountains Stairs: Why write about stairs? Most hotels today only offer elevators to go up and down to the rooms. The Hyatt Regency Scottsdale at Gainey Ranch offers wide open stairways so you can get a little exercise while going back-and-forth to your room. Rooms: Every guest room is exquisitely appointed with modern conveniences and a soft comfortable Hyatt bed Hang out: There are dozens of things to do in north Scottsdale but if you prefer hanging out, the spaces at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale are fantastic for just lounging. Lower lobby bar: The lower lobby bar is a cool place to hang out with a significant selection of libations and wines. Try the house Chardonnay. Parking: Self parking is free for registered guests and a short walk. Those who want to arrive and leave in style will pay $33 a day at valet. Staff I met are friendly and courteous. Reserve a room online. And enjoy your stay.",positive
"A true five star resort! The pools and grounds are absolutely amazing. The staff is super friendly. We felt welcomed the moment we arrived. Our kids loved the sandy beach and played for 7 hours at the pool, even in 100+ heat. The room was modern and clean. The only downside was the $20 per day parking. If your charging $350 a night, it should include parking.",positive
This Regency certainly had excellent service and qualities I look for in a desert hotel. The property was gorgeous and the pool and bathrooms were very clean. The open air lobby and bar with food service was a great spot to unwind. The property as a whole felt renovated but the gym was extremely outdated with terrible equipment. This is the main reasoning for my review = 4 stars. Thank you for the accommodations Hyatt. Please upgrade your Gym to earn that remaining star.,positive
"Have not been here in years. Stopped after dinner (somewhere else) to have drinks and enjoy the music in the lobby. It did not have the same ambiance as a few years ago - disappointing. The walk around the pools is still amazing, but the service and the atmosphere were less than spectacular, as I remember it. Hope they get some good bands and get the crowd going agin.",negative
"I love staying at this Hyatt when we visit Scottsdale. It's clean, modern, and has great entertainment with live and talented musicians. They also have delicious sushi! The pools are a must during the summer as they have many of them with waterfalls, slides, and volleyball! The landscaping is well kept with plentiful palm trees and grass. My husband and I took a gondola boat ride within the resort lake. It was a romantic and wonderful experience which I highly recommend. We went on it in the evening, but I'm sure it would be just as beautiful during the day. There are many ducks on the lake, candle light in the boat, and a great singer to guide. We've had an excellent experience every time we stay at this resort and we will continue to do so.",positive
"Stopped by for drinks, dessert and live music at Center Stage Bar. Had a very enjoyable time! Very chill vibe. Walked around the beautiful grounds for a bit and can't wait to come back when it's nicer weather to sit outside, go for a gondola ride and possibly even stay for a staycation!!",positive
"An absolutely beautiful Hyatt in Scottsdale! Can easily get to North Scottsdale, Old Town, or even down town Phoenix! It is hard to beat the pools and expansive grounds! Good food options and even canals with gondola rides, you can't go wrong with a stay here!! Relaxing, gorgeous, and the quality that comes with the Hyatt Regency brand!",positive
Staff is friendly. The pool area is awesome. Traveling with a 3 year old and 9 month old can make things difficult. Having the beach access in the pool is awesome. Live music at night is a nice touch in the lobby area. Our room was very large with plenty of extra space.,positive
Just spent 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale resort with my husband again and really enjoyed myself. This resort is great for all ages (we're in our late 20's) We ate at SWB twice and had great food and fantastic service. William really made an impression and went the extra mile. Matt at check out and Hayley at checkin were both very friendly. The pool was great and HUGE with lots of fun things to do like volleyball and a slide. TJ helped us with our luggage on our way in and our way out and he was really nice and professional. We were married here at this resort last January and TJ helped us with our TONS of luggage and wedding stuff then as well and was just as great! We love this resort and can't wait to come back again.,positive
"We stayed for a couple of days while visiting family in the Phoenix area. The facility and grounds are beautiful. The pools were easily enough to keep my nephew busy all day. Staff was helpful and engaging. Could only give 3 stars due to attention to the little things. For instance, we ordered dinner from the bar and it took about an hour (though the server apologized). Then, we noticed the burger my wife ordered was lacking the sweet onion jam it listed. The server said we must have read an old menu and it wasn't offered any more. And my cheese plate was lacking the spiced nuts (they were out). I saw pieces of candy wrappers in the hallway that made it thru the night and were still present in the morning. And then there was the big ol' fake eyelash stuck to a base board in our bathroom..... I'd come back, though. We got a nice deal thru Hotwire and it was very much worth what we paid. It really is a nice place to relax. But, it wasn't as top notch as other Hyatt's we've enjoyed...",negative
"Amazing!!! Bring your golf clubs because there is a nice one right next door. Staff were friendly and the place is amazing!!! I was staying for business and didn't get to explore the resort thoroughly, but for what I did experience it was definitely a 5 star!!!",positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights and we had a great experience! I thought this hotel was more for families with kids, but it was a good relaxing place for couples as well. When we checked in, we got a complimentary margarita. Every staff we encountered with were super friendly. The Concierge gave us good recommendations for hiking. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The servers at the restaurants were friendly and personable. The bellman always greeted us with a smile. The rooms were clean and up-to-date. Self parking and WiFi is complimentary. They have separate adult pools available so there was always plenty of space even over the 4th of July weekend. We found a quiet place and even had one of the small pools to ourselves. We even got to watch the fireworks outside! Went to the spa a couple times. Dined at SWB for breakfast. Nothing fell short. I'd definitely consider staying here again.",positive
"Great weekend vacation spot! We stayed here Memorial Day weekend and had a wonderful time. HIGHS - Beautiful grounds - Modern, spacious rooms (even for the standard/basic room) - Lovely pool area and quiet adult pool away from all the little screamers over at the ""family"" pool and water slides - Outstanding service everywhere - Good food at all the restaurants, with plenty of vegan & vegetarian options - Fantastic spa with a gorgeous pool and every other amenity you could ask for. Facials and massages by skilled staff (ask for Diane for massage - my husband said she is the best ever) ""LOWS"" (I'm picky!) - No shower in the pool area. I hate leaving chlorine in my hair all day. I can't understand why there is no shower as that's standard at every resort I've been to. - Pool area restrooms are really far away from the adult pool and you have to wind your way through the crowded family pool area to get to the restrooms. - Adult pool cabanas face away from the pool (towards the gondola pond). Not a bad view, but not what I expected. Special thanks to steward Adam Bacon - he took the time to find out the brand name of the resort's water glasses so I could buy some for home. Despite being really busy, Adam happily tracked down the info and emailed it to me. Just an example of Hyatt staff going out of their way to contribute to a wonderful vacation. We will definitely be back, mostly due to the friendly service. You can tell people like working here and in all my travels, I can't think of another resort who offers better customer service.",positive
"The grounds are beautiful. My room was clean, up to date and light. Loved it. The team was excellent from the valet, to registration to lost and found department. I left my hair brush, the lost and found team took two days to track it down. Called me twice with updates and status. They found it and sent it back to me. Great experience. Thank you.",positive
"Oh, this place is lovely. Here for business and I'm in love. Great rooms, pretty views, friendly staff. It isn't overwhelmingly large but has tons to eat and do. Wish I had time for the beach and water slides but I might be able to see the gondola. I can see people on the lawn doing yoga and playing volleyball and I feel zen by association. Has all the pluses of a Hyatt property, and this one is great for business and family alike. Almost wish my family was here... Almost. Complimentary margaritas when you check in too. Hyatt Lost Pines had mimosas but margaritas trump that.",positive
Just checked into our room with a family of four. The sleeping was a bit tight with four of us on two double beds. I called the front desk to ask for a cott for one of the young ones and the woman at the front desk flat out refused. She said they were only available for a King Room. She said you csn check our website to see for yourself. Not a great way to make an impression on guests who literally checked in minutes earlier and who are staying for a few nights. I've had better reception from the front desk staying at a Holiday Inn.,negative
"""In a word...Serene"" What can I say about the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa @ Gainey Ranch? It was our first trip to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and if you enjoy the simple luxuries of a short-refreshing weekend to get away from it all, this is the place to stay. The property is secluded, but yet a short drive to the main area of downtown Scottsdale. The service is wonderful, there were check-in kiosks, and plenty of receptionists (it was a mid-afternoon check-in). The rooms were clean, modern, and typical of business style hotel as most hyatts, sheratons, and other hotels of the sort. What stood out to us was the setting. The hotel as you drive up has a large fountain in the middle of square (yes, not circular) driveway, and the hotel is just plain open. You can see the large sitting area (where at night people gather to drink, mingle, and even roast marshmallows). Beyond that is what is a large pool area (1 adult only pool, and a general-large all ages pool area). More about that in a minute. If you veer to the right of the pool area and behind it is this small yet peaceful garden, and beyond that was a full golf course. Now the piece du resistance (for me anyways is the expansive pool area). The pool has the typical hot-tub, poolside bar, but beyond that it has small basketball hoop, two volleyball nets, a sandy beach section, a couple of waterfalls, and a 3 story water slide (excellent). Now could it have been the weather was beautiful (80 degrees in late October), combined with one of my favorite pluses to a hotel, a large pool area, honestly a pool area to either bathe in the sun, sip a lovely beverage or dip in the pool, to me that's a holiday (even if it was a short weekend getaway) holiday none the less. Right, the pool being expansive yet it didn't feel too large or overwhelming with tons of other hotel guests doing the same, because then I would've gone to the adult only, you would expect the pool area to be popular right? For checkout there are two major pluses 1, it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home, and it has spots for rental care return. As for the spa my girlfriend's sister made use of it's services, and for me I stepped into the reception area for nor more than five minutes with the combination of near whispering of the staff, the soft gentle music, and the rock laden water fountain, I wanted to sit in of the comfy chairs and fall asleep. But you don't have to take my word for it. In essence if you stay in the Phoenix /Scottsdale area whether for a short weekend, or long holiday this has to be one of the choices to stay.",positive
"I really miss this place. I've stayed at quite a bit of ""top-notch"" ""resort"" hotels in phoenix and nothing seems to hold up to such standards or please me as much as this place did. Even my husband (who doesn't care for anything fancy) recalls our wonderful stay and wants to go back for a getaway!",positive
"Nice looking place, but my last stay was an abomination. They up sold me a suite, when all I wanted was a regular room. They said there were not available. I later found out that they lied. The front desk was rude. I had to wait 3 hours to check in. The waits for the restaurant were long and the pool bar was empty because the bartenders were ignorant and betting on football games.",negative
"One of the most beautiful hotels I've been to, comparable to Vegas hotels. The rooms are beautiful and clean with a nice and upscale shower with massaging jets! The pool is amazing, different pool activities for all ages, and great for a family stay. I totally recommend!",positive
"In town for work, I booked my stay at this hotel without really knowing anything about it (other than it being a Hyatt, within my price range and within relatively close distance to my customer). What a surprise as I pulled up - the grounds are GORGEOUS. I felt like I was on vacation!! Palm trees in the driveway leading up to the hotel, live music in the lobby bar as I checked in. I leaned over the balcony to see if there was a wedding or maybe a corporate event, but no! It was just the lobby bar area with live musicians! It was such a nice experience. The room itself with very clean, very comfortable. I slept like I've never slept in a hotel bed before, like a baby! I had sushi in the sushi restaurant within the hotel (I'll be honest, I found some other higher-rated sushi places on Yelp that were relatively close and I was planning on stepping out for dinner), but the music and general atmosphere was so cool, I decided to hang out and try the place inside. I'm glad I did, the service was great and the sushi was very fresh. When the sushi chef mentioned the 10 interconnecting pools AND a slide, I felt cheated. I need to come back here, when I don't have to work!! Overall, everyone I spoke with was super friendly and I honestly look forward to coming back! I totally echo one of the previous reviewers comment about coming back to Scottsdale just to stay at this hotel, it's definitely on the list of to-do's!",positive
"I went here for a business trip and never wanted to leave. It was clean, relaxing, beautiful. Everything I could ever ask for from a hotel.",positive
"I was here for a work conference but it was a vacation for me. The place is amazing. It has really clean and nice rooms, the view is amazing. Everything is very open and the place has everything you need. You don't really need to leave this place. I was hesitant about the restaurants located inside the hotel but the Sushi restaurant near the lobby is really good and not that expensive and the SWB bistro is also pretty good. The swimming pools are nice, the water slides are fun, the tennis courts are nice, the fitness center, golf course are all really nice. I would highly recommend coming to this place.",positive
"Ugh I have a massive headache due to staying out till 1am last night and not going to bed till 3am and I have a date pending tonight. On top of that it's Friday and all I can think about is the fact that I have FIVE days off for the July 4th holiday...WOO HOO!!!! And then I started thinking about the 90 min massage I have scheduled for Monday afternoon, which then prompted me to think about some great massages I've had and I thought immediately of the spa at Hyatt Gainey Ranch. It's been a tradition for I don't know how long that 2 of my girl friends and I go to a spa on Christmas Eve to celebrate my friend, Christine's birthday, which is actually on Christmas Eve. Then we go to our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale, Bloom, afterwards. First we started out going to a day spa that changed ownership and names, but then decided to upgrade to the full-on resort experience. We've been going to Gainey for probably the past 3 years and we love it. They remodeled not long ago and the place is very beautiful. I didn't see it prior to the remodel, but it is one of my favorite spas by far and I've been to one at an expensive boutique hotel in Barcelona that didn't even compare. My friends and I always go early to enjoy the pool and jacuzzi. You gotta love being able to wear a bikini in December! The pool and jacuzzi don't have any chlorine. They are all mineral water pools/jacuzzis. And like all expensive resorts, you get a robe and slippers and can have your choice of lemon or fruit infused water to sip on. The waiting room where they call you for your appointment is very relaxing and comfortable and have lounge chairs/chaises for you to lay on while you wait. Every room comes equipped with an iPod and Bose system so that when you walk in there is a card listing different playlists that you can choose from for your massage. I always get the hot stone massage and I have yet to be disappointed with any masseuse I've had. Of course, I only choose females to massage me and so does my friend Britt. I'm sorry, but there is no way a man I don't know is going to massage me, especially when I like to go naked for my massages. The reason why I gave this 4 stars is because Christine once went during the summer for a massage and had a male masseuse who completely molested her here. We laugh about it, but it was seriously not right. He had a total hard-on and kept pressing it into her and he kept grazing her hoo-ha during the massage. WHY she never reported the guy I do not know! BUT SERIOUSLY DO NOT let that deter you. I've never had an experience like that here or anywhere else. Just stick with a female masseuse. =) Moving on...I am always SO relaxed by the time I leave here that it doesn't even register that I still have to drive 2 hours to get to Tucson to spend Christmas with my family. It definitely preps me! And as if the massage wasn't pure bliss, the swedish shower is also heavenly. There's only one, but it's the only shower I use. It's huge and sprays at you from every direction. They've got shampoo, conditioner and shower gel all ready in the showers for you to use, unless you're like me and like to bring your own shampoo/conditioner. Hey! I spend nearly $200 on my hair every time I go so I will only use the best products. I highly recommend this spa over many I've tried in Scottsdale. The Phoenician is also very good, but it's not as nice as Gainey. It's going to be just as pricey for any other resort massage, which means at least $125 for a 50 minute massage, not including tip, but the amenities are superb! It's definitely the best way to spend my Christmas Eve and my friend's birthday!",positive
"holy shit i love this hotel. super nice, big main lobby with live music and a fire, acres of pools that include a beach and a waterslide, and amazing drinks poolside next to a bomb golf course. this place is unreal. you just plain have to go here. the restaurants are good, but most of your day you will spend by the pool sipping on great frozen drinks while occasionally finding a small pool somewhere you didn't know existed. make it happen.",positive
"Quite possibly one of the loveliest pools around. It's actually more of a complex of interconnected pools complete with a beach at one end (kid alert!) and a swim-up bar on the other side. At night the whole complex is enchanting. The staff is quite friendly and the hotel boasts several good bar options for hanging out and soaking up atmosphere. Did I say friendly staff? Hmm, let me just say that my every interaction with a member of this team was accompanied by a genuine smile and/or ""How are you?"". Hospitality industry veterans (yep, that's me) are pretty good at spotting the grit-teeth-and-smile-at-the-annoyance look. I never saw it here. What I truly love about this hotel, however, is the very dramatic lobby with it's many levels and views. It just screams ""I am at a resort!"" and I adore it. Full disclosure - I have never stayed here as a private guest, only as a member of a business conference (several years in a row), but I would definitely put this place in my top choices of places to stay should I ever come as a private vacationer.",positive
If I could give this hotel no stars I would. The mattress and the sheets have stains everywhere. The shower was not cleaned. This hotel is disgusting... DO NOT RESERVE A ROOM HERE!!!!!,negative
"I stayed in the presidential suite. Which is far from presidential. The office staff was rude. The jacuzzi tub was filthy so I bought what I needed to clean it myself. After cleaning it I realized the dials to turn on the jacuzzi were broken. The enclosed patio had a disgusting smell. However, the rest of the suite was clean. The exterior of the building wasn't maintained well and the swimming pool had a bunch of hair wads floating in it. The best thing here was the free breakfast and the nice ladies that served it.",negative
"Excellent hotel depending on what you came for. I came for the fun and in my opinion it was a very nice hotel for being just 70 dollars! I went in with very low expectations but it ended up being fabulous, from happy hour to breakfast in the morning! If you're looking for fun at a low cost, this is the place to go :)",positive
"Typical $60 hotel. Minus: Lower quality furnished, rooms are small, noisy and with spartan amenities. Plus: Close to Baseline and Hwy 10, surprising great breakfast with hot fresh items and wide selection of fruit. Rooms are clean. Manager has a great FREE Happy Hour with two Tip: If opting for breakfast, arrive early, as seating is limited!",negative
This is the slimiest hotel I've ever stayed in. We booked it to be near the airport for an early flight. It was dirty and everything had mildew. The carpet was wet. It smelled horrible. If it wasn't so late when I got there I would have definitely found another place to stay.,negative
It's your average motel suite with a mini fridge and microwave. There's a nice breakfast every morning until 10am. A lounge that serves alcohol so you can booze it all day if you'd like. And the pool next to that lounge. Only one pool though. The walls seam really thin but I wasn't disturbed while I was here. Great location and access to the highway and a large mall across the street. But you may see some questionable characters hanging around the property or the circle K next door.,negative
"We just finished a 4 day/3 night trip to Havasupai Falls with Jason Hamburger as our guide. From the beginning, we were impressed with JRI's organization and communication :) We were able to prepare for our trip with all their available resources. We were not lacking any equipment. Everything we needed was on their lists. As for the hike itself, we are so happy to have used a guide service, and Jason exceeded our expectations. We met him at the orientation which was quick and informative. He gave us a rough outline of his plan (which was always flexible to meet our group's needs and weather concerns). We felt confident with his ability to lead us down the correct trails and maintain a pace appropriate for our group. He made sure we were aware of the dangers of the extreme heat (it was over 105 degrees) and was prepared to help if we needed it. Once at camp, we felt pampered considering this is a backpacking and camping trip! He took care of everything, including finding a great site, setting up tents, preparing all meals (which were great for camping- not just instant mush or a can with a fork in it!!!), and giving us options for our time (such as which day to take a long hike and which day to relax). We decided to take a night hike out to beat the heat, and that was a very memorable and enjoyable decision. After getting to know him and his ability we trusted him to guide us out in the dark (with headlamps, of course). Hiking out at night is something you should experience! This trip would not have been as fulfilling without Jason's expertise, the quality equipment, transportation (we flew into Phoenix and did not need to rent a car, and JRI's organization from the initial reservation to completion. We would book another adventure with them, especially if Jason is the guide!!! Hikers: be honest about your ability and fitness level and you won't have any problems. This is a great trip!!!",positive
Our guide Ryan was awesome! We had the best time and such breathtaking sights. Very informative and knowledgeable about the canyon and VERY patient. Managed to make coffee even with a missing coffee filter... amazing. We went to the best waterfalls It was beautiful.,positive
"Mu first backpacking trip was a success because of Sabrina and the owners of this establishment. Not only are they friendly, knowledgeable and reasonable priced but they really care about you having a great experience. I went in almost weekly with questions about my upcoming trip to Havasupai Falls. They got me in the right gear, made sure I knew how to use everything correctly and mostly important I was prepared. My trip was great because of them.",positive
"We're just back from an amazing Havasupai trip. Our guide, Jason Hamburger was absolutely the best!!! 4 days & 3 nights of awesomeness!! The falls are breathtaking!! Jason was so informative & full of stories about Grand Canyon & its Indians that reside there. I hope to make the trip again in the future with some friends Jason will be our guide because I couldn't think of having it any other way!! Well worth the drive from Ms. --- Aimee M. Coleman",positive
"This longtime adventure guide company just recently opened a retail store so I stopped in to check it out and was very impressed. It's not a huge store, but it has an excellent selection of merchandise and more importantly, staff that know what they are doing and are passionate about the products they sell. I spent a fair amount of time talking with Sabrina who not only knows the merchandise, but is herself a guide and an accomplished outdoorswoman who has spent time using it and guiding tours and hikes throughout Arizona. I was impressed that she took the time to talk with me, find out my needs, and help me find the right product, along with a lot of good advice for how to use it. During my current visit, I purchased a lightweight frying pan to take on my campouts, but I'm very interested to return and pick up a new pack one of these days and she showed me a few options that will definitely be on my shopping list when I do. If you like to hike or camp and also want to support local business owners, make your way to Shea and the 101 and check out Just Roughin' It, you won't regret it!",positive
"I recently returned from an amazing 4-day Rim to Rim Grand Canyon hike organized and led by Just Roughing It Adventures! Patrick, our guide, made every effort to ensure that we (there were 5 in our group) all had an unforgettable and worry-free experience. He went above and beyond to keep us safe and comfortable, constantly checking in with us and adjusting our backpacks to alleviate any undue pressure points or weight issues. He prepared delicious meals for us and lured us out of our tents each morning with a hot cup of coffee! He was patient and accommodating, making sure our individual needs were met, He was also fun and funny, keeping us entertained with storytelling and lots of great information about the history and geology of the canyon. He guided us to a spectacular view of Ribbon Falls and made us dinner at sunset on Plateau Point. Kyle and Jason (our drivers) were also great. I highly recommend JRI and can't wait to go on more adventures with them! P.S. We even spotted a bunnilope!",positive
"Just finished a rim2rim hike of the Grand Canyon. Booked outfitting and guide service through JRI. Equipment provided (backpack, tent, sleeping bag) was top self. Best of all our guide was amazing! Put up with 5 moderately aged men for our 4 day adventure like a champ. The guide prepared delicious meals, helped with our equipment, shared fun facts and history of the Canyon, and most of all helped me to finish. Without his help I would probably still be in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Thanks Ryan Ashley! I would recommend JRI and highly recommend Ryan!",positive
"My husband and I have taken two backpacking trips with Just Roughin It- Rim to Rim in the Grand Canyon with Chad and Gregor and one that we just completed in Yosemite- Yosemite Falls to Snow Creek with Ryka. Both were four day, three night camping and hiking trips. We really like this company and they give a discount for repeat customers. It's also nice to travel with guides who are knowledgeable about the area, know the trails and can assist with any issues that arise. The guides were all very friendly and knowledgeable. The company provided almost all of the gear and the food-which is pretty good. The guides showed a lot of concern for the well being of guests including foot care, hydration, and the general fatigue factor. We would definitely travel with them again.",positive
"My daughter and I just got back from Havasupai, using JRI Adventure Company. If you plan this trip through this company, please insist that Adam Harward be your guide. Adam has been down that canyon dozens of times and is a backpacking bad ass. He made sure that everyone was well taken care of. His attention to feet care, hydration and nutrition made sure our bodies were able to manage the demanding schedule and experience/enjoy everything. Additionally, Adams knowledge of the secret spots, supai tribe, geology and botany were educational. It seemed that Adam had an interesting story for every area we ventured to. My only wish is that we left the trail head early to escape the heat. Other than that one small issue, this company runs a tight ship. Kudos JRI and Adam Harward!!!!!",positive
"I had an absolutely incredible time on the South Kaibab to Bright Angel tour with Just Roughin' It. This was really my first backpacking trip and having a company like Just Rougin' It take care of the entire experience was just a breeze. Their entire program, which included being picked up near a hotel near Scottsdale Airport and driven to the canyon was just perfectly done. I can't say enough great things about tour guide Liz Griffiths, if you go on a tour with Just Roughin' It, you should absolutely ask to see if she's available. The group we had was a blast, with a lot of laughs and an incredible experience from start to finish. The views in the Grand Canyon are just unbelievable. You will see some views that are almost impossible to believe and you'll have an experience impossible to forget. Highly Recommended!",positive
"My husband and I did the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim Packrafting trip in late September. Our guide, Michael, was AWESOME. If you're looking for an extreme adventure, this trip is for you. I would give JRI five stars except for the fact that the trip was pricey and we had a few challenges getting the hiking/backpacking permits, but Debbie at JRI was able to reverse our trip so that we could go on the days we wanted to.",positive
"Never ever ever again will I purchase a guided hike without doing my research. Do not use this company! I do not know how to delete the one star. After much thought, I decided not to elaborate on this hike, hence I will not receive a refund. First may I state I will never return to the Grand Canyon. Such terrible memories. I will express my horror as we ran out of food and water, as our ""ONE"" water filter broke. day 2, of 4 days. There are many many other terrible mishaps that took place, but I will only state, ""Take my word for it! Use a different company!""",negative
"We had a great trip with Dallan and the team at Just Roughin It. We hiked the Grand Canyon and camped in Cremation Canyon. The team was great in all the advance prep and it was a blast. Dallan was very informative on the history, geology, etc ... and made us a great dinner as the sun dropped in the canyon. Perfect. Additionally, it was nice having someone else working out all the permits. I already have my next trip booked.",positive
"I booked a hiking trip with Just Roughin' it. Later I called to check about changing the dates, leaving a clear message to CALL ME. They changed the date, canceled the guide to the original date, then called me. My trip plans ended up not changing, and I lost the trip because of it.",negative
"We have prepaid for a kayak rental but twice now when we try to book it, they are closed on the days & times that they list as being open. Instead of just letting us hold onto the kayak an extra couple days until they are open again they said they would charge us for the extra days, even the day they were supposed to be open but are not. We would not be using them on those days because we are only able to go out to the lake for one day. They would just sit in our garage until Just Roughin It tells us they are back so that we cold return them. We shouldn't have to pay for their decision not to be open. It's not like they would lose money by doing so because no one else could rent them when they are closed anyway. Good business practice ensures more business by word of mouth. We have 75 guests coming to town next month, many of who have asked us for recommendations on what to do outdoors. Of course we will recommend places and businesses where we have had good experiences. I cannot comment on their Grand Canyon tours because this review only pertains to their kayak and paddle board rental and their business practice.",negative
"My wife booked us a half-day kayaking trip at Canyon Lake for my birthday. Went out this morning, and were met by our guide, John. After a brief lesson, we were paddling across the lake. Neither of us had been in a kayak before, and we had a blast. John was friendly, and fun, and full of information. Thanks, John, for a great morning! Dane and Jenn",positive
I have done several trips with this company and each time they have overpromised and under-delivered. I would highly recommend checking out another company for your guided trip. I will not be using them again.,negative
I can't even give this place a 1 star. The pool is bright green. We knew we were not getting high class! But this is the most horrifying motel I have ever been in. My daughters feet were pitch black after a couple steps on the carpet. We got two bath towel that looks like someone changed the oil with. No wash clothes. Not even a bar of soap to wash your hands. DO NOT go here! My daughter was actually scared of the other people occupying rooms.,negative

"Since the internet said the hotel was $36 a night, I mistakenly thought it to be true. READ THE FINE PRINT. They charge two other fees each night on top of a $60 deposit. I would have rather slept in my car. The hotel is in a completely shady area of Phoenix. The people were just as shady. The first woman at the front desk tried to convince us (a gay couple) we should have two full beds instead of the one king I booked (because they didn't have my room available). The first room reaked of smoke. When I went to exchange rooms, the man up front was completely rude. Our second room's bathroom door was completely torn apart, stains all over the curtains. The beds weren't made and on top of that it had ROACHES! Disgusting. I don't know how this hotel gets off charging people any money, much less the amount that they do! You will regret your stay. Please check out the photos if you think I'm exaggerating.",negative
"When it comes to picking low cost hotels, my expectations are pretty low. I go in knowing that you're gonna get what you pay for. Usually that's fine because when I decide to go cheap, it's purely with the intent of just having a place to sleep... This however was nasty! There were stains all over the bed, cockroaches everywhere, the door lock hatch was busted off, the room reeked of cigarettes, the bathroom fan was sparking, the shower didn't work, and the ceiling was sunk in in the shower area (This usually means that there was a flood in the upstairs plumbing and if gone untreated, massive amounts of mold and asbestos grow). This is a serious health violation... I normally take in these reviews ""with a grain of salt"", but this place definitely matches it's reputation.",negative
"Death Toll crazy high. NO JOKE! PLUS, Worst motel stay ever! I made reservations online and picked the cheapest motel because March Madness and Spring Break was in town that bumped the prices up to astronomical. Our trip fiascos were making us run late, so we called to say that we weren't going to check in at 12 like previously discussed but that we would be there about 5 p.m. We arrived at about 6 o'clock to find out that our room had not even remotely been cleaned yet and that there were no available rooms at the time. We were told to wait an hour while they cleaned a room. I also had to give them $60 cash for a damage deposit. I then had to sign a piece of paper saying that if the cops were called that I would lose my deposit as well as if there was any damage to the room. That should have been my first clue. We finally get the key to the room to find out that the four people that are to be using it, get to share one king size bed. At that point had to go back to the office which was all the way on the other side of the building, to let the snarkey desk guy, that was serving us, know that he gave us the key to the wrong room. We tried cancel 5 minutes after I signed the papers and he said that there were no cancellations allowed. So unfortunately, we had to stay in this hellhole. We finally make it in the correct room and it smells like 10 gallons of air freshener were poured onto the beds and into the carpet to mask the smell of pot, mold, and probably meth. The room looked somewhat clean but there were candy wrappers under the bed that were not ours, so they did not clean under the beds and there were burn holes in the blankets. No fridge, microwave, coffee pot, etc. About 2 o'clock in the morning we wake to screaming between a man and woman. Apparently the woman had called the cops on the man and he was busy taunting and waiting for them to show up. This went on for probably about an hour. The next day we get up and are driving away and a man with a Pit Bull is letting his dogs sniff the red rag that's in his hand. I wonder what he's looking for? So after the whole ordeal I look up the address and find this lovely article about how many people have been murdered in this Motel. Here is the link http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/north-phoenix/second-night-second-deadly-shooting-at-knights-inn-hotel-in-north-phoenix Oh and don't wear red or blue here!",negative
"Just left the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Broken furniture, employees on meth, everything had cigarette burns in it. Continental breakfast was crappy. No stars and I will Never be back. Can't believe Travel Lodge would put their name n reputation on this horrible place.",negative
"I would just like to say that I am not a very picky person, when it comes to hotels or motels. This place is cheap, yes, but I'd much rather stay at a place that is clean and I feel safe in. The room was a good size but right when my friend and I walked in there was a guy and girl having very audible sex. I've never in in my times of going to a motels have felt more uncomfortable. The beds made me so itchy. I immediately regretted going there. Overall I would never go again. I felt very unsafe because there was people walking and talking throughout the entire night. Our car was parked pretty far so that didn't help. Don't go here use the extra money to find somewhere nicer.",negative
"Booked this place via my cell phone last minute on a spur of the moment road trip for spring training. All we needed was a place to sleep and get dressed. We checked in got our card to our room. Our room was all the way at the back of the hotel. Upon driving back we see several people loitering around, we see where our room there are more people loitering, a man fixing his truck, doors missing from rooms, broken windows, people starring us down. We turned around and went back to the front. The receptionist asked what wrong to which we replied we are not staying here we don't feel safe. He was going to refund us our money but since we booked it online through Travelocity we had to go through them. I called Travelocity when we returned home and they attempted to reach the hotel, when they finally did the hotel refused to refund us our money. We paid for a raunchy unsafe hotel room that was not used. Thanks Knights Inn for your outstanding and understanding customer service we will be sure to NEVER stay there and be sure that we Let everyone know that you keep guests money even when you know the conditions of your hotel and how unsafe it is for a family.",negative
"Would not recommend to my worst enemy. I'm not picky at all when it comes to these things, but this hotel did not have hot water, it is super outdated, cable TV was unhooked, and it is next to the freeway so it is loud. I didn't even want to try the breakfast after my experience!",negative
"Everyone here is high on meth and all tweeked out, drug dealers and prostitutes everywhere, you ll probably get robbed, very unsafe place. And i heard they had bed bugs in some rooms",negative
"This motel has policies that are essentially bait and switch. We specifically requested a a smoking room, they overbooked the property and tried to get us into a non smoking room. In addition, they demand a $40 cash deposit if you're local in addition to your room rental that they can hold onto if they think you violate any of their rules. There were more than a few drug users on the property. We had to demand our money back and they fought us the whole way. Go stay somewhere else. No other way to say it.",negative
"This hotel is disgusting. First of all be warned that it's right next to a strip club so it's obvious that it's a sex motel. Once I walked into the room I realize what a mistake I had made for not knowing the area. The bed had pubes in it, the walls had (grease?) stains. The pillow looked like it had been ran over all over the freeway and was stained with someone's make up (face down ass up?) This place refused to do any kind of refund. Basically the worst mistake I've ever made do not go here unless you have absolutely no qualms with sleeping in a disgusting place. Cannot believe I did not receive a refund.",negative
"This place got 1 star because they made me give a rating !!!This place is a scam DO NOT make reservations through the 1-800 number they tell you, you can cancel anytime as long as you call the location but the number they give you (602) 938-0286 rings with no answer. I didn't stay there and they charged my card 465.15 witch is more than what I was quoted on these ppl are scum called the 1-800 number back and got the run around and they didn't do anything they are so incompetent. Very angry!!!",negative
"Very expensive, for no refrigerator, microwave, or blow dryers. 3 nights cost us $590. Did not include any breakfast. I would never suggest this hotel to anybody. Very badly needs updated. Still the old type T.V.s.Also needs customer service overhaul.",negative
"I only wish there was a rating below terrible, because that is where this hotel needs to be rated. I booked & paid for a clean & fresh, non smoking hotel room with two double beds, and all that goes along with that. AND WE GOT NONE OF THAT ~~ This hotel has everything from rude ""i don't give a damn I just work here"" employees to the new paint trying to cover over black mold (I took pictures & will be reporting to health department), to musty smoke smelling rooms. Rooms prices or quality do not compare with comparable hotels in the area. We booked on line for a not smoking room. When we opened the door to our room the smell of fresh cigarette smoke almost knocked me over and I gagged. Went to the front desk, got another room & not an apology, but a smart ass comment. The second room was no better than the 1st. Went back to the office, and was given another room and got more attitude and rude comments. Third room was a little better barely tolerable but we were BASICALLY STUCK! We had booked on line and the ""desk boy"", as he referred to himself, was extremely annoyed and was more than happy to argue with my son in the lobby about the situation. And in no way was he going to provide good or even adequate guest relations/customer service. The ""desk boy"" said he would send an air freshener to the room. After some time and at least one more call to the desk, a guy with a spray bottle full of pink sickening sweet chemicals showed up. And without saying a word he began squirting down the carpet, curtains and our personal items (for no reason other than he was being a jerk). Our person belongs were up and out of his way. This proved to be less than helpful and did nothing but leave the carpet wet. And did nothing for the layer of smoke film on the tables desk & chairs The room proved to be way over priced when a lady who checked in after we did, getting one of the rooms we didn't want paid 1/2 as much as we did. The hotel should be accountable for the booking agent and have control and authority and control to override their decisions when things go wrong. All we kept hearing was YOU BOOKED ON LINE SO WE CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. If booking on line is such a bad thing it shouldn't be offered. Our room was a double queen meant to accommodate 4 guests. We had to call several times to the desk to get more than the one bath towel in our room. And finally had to go get them off the house keepers cart ourselves.",negative
"Can't imagine a better dive shop. All the staff are friendly and professional. Special orders are never a problem. The several items I've purchased were top notch and Chad completely explained the benefits and differences between the models, NEVER any pressure to buy. Chad wants you to buy when you are ready and not under pressure to make a sale. I've been on several chartered trips, Lake Pleasant, San Diego and San Carlos, and have felt each time i was a valued customer. Training is by the book and you are not just another student. You are expected to know, understand and be able to confidently perform all the required skills before being given your cert card. That's the way it should be, training courteous divers who can handle the skills they've acquired. Small classes for individualized instruction. When diving with others its very apparent LP Scuba places a premium on training quality divers. No murky waters with LPScuba students! No more shore on my gear with LPScuba's boat at Lake Plesant!",positive
"Yes, Jeff at LP scuba was great to deal with. however, he is no longer there. i bought several items from them earlier this year. jeff said i could return if i had a receipt. unfortunately, a mask broke (mfg problem), they replaced with another one. they would not give me a refund, just store credit on the replacement. unfortunately, it got lost in the water. got the 3rd mask and asked for a blue edge. received a gray edge instead. chad at lp scuba only store credit. really? again? very disappointed with their service. emailed chad & copied janell 5 days ago, no response. their customer service is awful...takes forever to get an answer, they don't answer the phone, etc.",negative
"LP Scuba is amazing. I went on a weekend trip with LP to San Carlos, Mexico and it couldn't have went any better. It was so fun and relaxing to just leave everything up to Chad and LP -- from transporation to accommodations to dining location to diving equipment and to the actual dive itself. The equipment I rented from LP was the best equipment I've ever rented before anywhere in the world. And their experienced dive masters brought us to amazing locations in the Sea of Cortez. I'll never forget the memories of underwater dancing with sea lions. We also saw plenty of eels, octopus, and even an elusive sea horse. amazing water temp and visibility. I'd give LP my HIGHEST recommendation. I can't wait to join LP Scuba for another trip soon.",positive
"We did a trip to San Carlos, Mexico in Aug '14 with LP, what a great experience. They took care of everything, all we had to do was show up and have fun. The drive down was easy, great accommodations, fun restaurants/bars, GREAT diving, and easy trip home. I've dove a dozen dives in Cali, and this trip was hands down better than any of those. And the price was such a great value. Chad took care of all the details, so my son and I could just relax and have a great experience visiting a new area and having a superb set of dives. Highest recommendation!",positive
"I stopped by LP on opening day and they were able to take care of all my needs. I needed a visual inspection of a tank, a complete service of my first and second stage, and I signed up for a class. LP Staff was knowledgeable and had the side mounts in stock I wanted to look at. It's the closest shop to Lake Pleasant so it's just a quick stop to drop off tanks after your dives. They do Nitrox, and Helix fills if you are trained on them. Great shop.",positive
"This place is just as beautiful as any photos you see! Everyone was extremely pleasant & the grounds are very clean. We got a pedicure & a massage, both were fantastic. The nail polish is vegan & made locally. After our spa treatments we spent a few hours at the pool. The pool was very nice & the food was delicious. We'll be back soon!",positive
"We really enjoyed our girls time here at the spa. It was a bit hard at first to get a hold of them, I called (3 times) and kept leaving messages but wouldn't get a call back. I finally called he hotel directly and she emailed the manager and it was easy sailing from there!! I bought a groupon for myself, my mother-in-law and a girlfriend that was visiting from out of town. My mother in law was supposed to get a pedicure but she had just gotten one prior to her trip to see us. I called the spa and they were super accommodating to switch it for a gel manicure (the groupon was the same price) we arrived a few minutes early and were offered water or tea. The ladies doing the manicures and pedicures were very friendly and personable but still professional. I wanted to make our day a little more special so I ordered a bottle of champagne with orange and cranberry juice and they took care of all the details for me. We ended our day lounging by the pool and eating...it was just wonderful!! And the decor of he whole property is beautiful. The automatic gratuity that was applied and written in the groupon offer was less than $20 which I think is more then fair. We will definitely make another trip back!!",positive
"I'm at a loss for words for how grateful I am to everyone at the Scott Resort and La Vidorra Spa - they made me look like an amazing planner and were super on top of all of our group's needs... so here goes nothing: I'm the MoH for my best friend's wedding and had been planning her bachelorette weekend in Scottsdale from afar. By far the trickiest part was finding a spa that accommodated our large group (10), didn't cost a fortune, and had great additional amenities. After calling / emailing about 14 spas, I finally found La Vidorra. Upon first talking to Kellee, I thought this was too good to be true... the price was THE BEST we were quoted, the resort looked amazing, and Kellee's communication was incredible throughout. As I started planning the weekend more thoroughly, I realized I needed a brunch location as well, and Kellee handled arranging that for 12 of us. Since we were going to be there for a while, I decided a cabana would be ideal, and once again Kellee set EVERYTHING up. Upon arrival, seeing my best friend's (and everyone else's tbh) reaction to the beautiful resort almost made me cry. The decor at the spa is so trendy and lush and magical. While there, we didn't have to lift a finger -- Kellee personally greeted me at brunch and made sure that everything from valet, to cabana and spa location was clear. While at the spa, Jill took amazing care of getting us set up w/ our therapists. I heard rave reviews from the girls about their massages but personally I'm sure my therapist Ashley had to have been the best! I've had several massages and this has hands down been the best ever, which I did not expect from such a small masseuse! (That'll teach me to make assumptions!) At one point, she told me, ""you have sciatica don't you?"" and I couldn't believe she could tell that. She worked diligently on my problem areas and even went over our scheduled time bc she really wanted to help me out. If she lived in SF, I'd have a monthly scheduled massage w/ her. I tend to think once I've visited a US city, that I won't plan another visit there on my own, so that I can try and see ALL the places lol but honestly, the Scott Resort & La Vidorra make me want to head back to Scottsdale immediately!!! Thanks to all who made the day so magical!",positive
"5 stars are in order for my facial with Lauren I was able to experience yesterday. I felt beyond pampered the moment Lauren greeted me. The scott resort is my top- tier favorite resort in Scottsdale and La Vidorra Spa won me over as well. The facial lasted 50 minutes and consisted of a double cleanse and Clarisonic to begin, a tingling-moisturizing mask and while the mask set she provided me with a comforting dry scalp massage. ***heaven*** I'm pretty sure when she asked how the pressure was I mumbled something incoherently because I began R.E.M. After the scalp massage were light extractions and a brightening mask that followed, the brightening mask and all the products smelled so sweet and subtle. Fresh and non-chemically. I am sensitive to fragrance and these products were absolutely no problem to my sensitivities. During the setting of my Brightening mask Lauren massaged my shoulders and forearms which completely melted the stress of the hectic work week away. I was so impressed with her facial massage layering on my moisturizer and sunscreen that I applied my night serums at home the same way! It makes such a difference. I will continue to pamper myself with Lauren at La Vidorra and fingers crossed my husband is reading this and catches my clue for upcoming birthday and holidays! *wink-wink*",positive
"Ugh...I really wanted to like this place. I got a Groupon for pedis for my friend and I as a birthday treat. Ashley was very...opinionated to say the least. We were escorted in to the nail room, which was cute, and started looking at the polish colors (not even a minute of looking) and Ashely blurted out that I should just pick the color for my friend since we wouldn't be able to get the full 50 minutes since she had to clean the pedi tub between our appointments. There were two pedi chairs so I'm not sure why one of us could have used the other instead of having time taken away from what I paid for. Through both appointments, Ashely was just negative. For example, I told my friend I was going to Tucson next weekend and Ashley responded with ""there's nothing there."" Even if that ends up being true, I'm not sure it was necessary to say that. Also, my pedi ended up being 30 minutes...Two days later and my toes feel like they are on fire so I guess that cleaning the pedi tub didn't really matter in the long run since I def caught something from this place. Very disappointing to say the least. We will not be back.",negative
"My reservation was for 180 mins and Andrea took care of me. I know it is a spa and most people go for rest and relaxation, but I have had a shoulder, neck, and right back problem with muscle tightness and spasm that affecting my sleep and daily life. Andrea listened to me and gave me the right treatment for my pain. She was attentive to my requests and she communicated what she was going to do to help me throughout the session. She targeted exactly where I needed her to focus. I cried out of relief by the time she was done. Thank you Andrea for truly caring and helping me! The spa is super cute with aromatherapy and homey decor. I really enjoyed the entire spa experience!",positive
"Just know that if you buy a groupon for 32 bucks, and have gel polish on, and agree to the mysterious tip your total price will be well over 70 dollars- for just a pedicure. When I booked it, i was not asked if I had gel nails. Many people have gel nails, it would have been a basic question to ask. So when I got there and the nail person saw I did have gel nails,she immediately changed her attitude from friendly to not friendly and told me she wouldn't be able to give me many of the services because of the time it would take to take off the gel (and mentioned it would be another 20 bucks). The tip itself that the girl at the end asked if i wanted to do and me stupidly agreeing to (in this culture where we are conditioned to even tip bad services), was like over 20 bucks. Nothing special and bad attitude. my heels are no better than they were when i went in and had to listen to snooty talk about how awful any other kind of pedi / mani is other than the kind they give. pass. I guess elitist attitudes shouldn't be suprising at an elitist spa.",negative
"When you first walk in, you automatically feel a sense of zen and relaxation. The antique decor looks amazing. My massage therapist Leanne was amazing and my pedicure service was outstanding. Highly recommend this place.",positive
"We went here for a bachelorette party and the supervisor did a great job coordinating as far as I could tell. There was a cute table with champagne glasses with all our names, she would pour our drinks, etc. The treatment rooms were pretty relaxing though I could someone hear traffic noises during my massage. I would never want to pay the original price of $90 for a 30 minute massage. Massage Envy is just as good and I could get a 90 minute massage including tip for that same price. Despite the price, my 30 minute massage was good. No real complaints there. This review is really about my nail services. The actual services were not close to worth the special group rate that we received. I received the one included ""upgrade"" worth $10 for their ""gel alternative"" nail polish. It was already starting to peel up the minute I walked out the door. It's less than 24 hours later and I feel like I could have done a better polish job myself. The services were scheduled for 50 minutes each though I feel like it was just slower, not more thorough or detailed. I feel like the nail salons in strip malls do a better, faster, and far less expensive manicures and pedicures.",negative
"Great place to get your nails done at the last minute. My daughter and I called and needed a same day, semi quick appointment. Valerie was sooo very accommodating, calling in employees who had the day off and juggling schedules. She was able to get us in with Kelly and Christina, who were fantastic. We both got manis and pedis and still made it to our event on time, thanks to the folks at Jurlique. Would definitely visit again.",positive
I loved my facial! This spa is super cute and tucked away a little bit. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and I left feeling very refreshed. I'll be back for sure!,positive
Stacey gave the best massage (and I get massage treatments on a regular basis). He listened to what I needed and got the knots and kinks out after 2 days of hiking. Thank you. Will visit this place again if we're back in phoenix!!!!,positive
Had a super relaxing massage and hand treatment today. Easy to book the appointment and no waiting for my appointment. Very happy and relaxed!,positive
"I absolutely loved my jade facial with Kellee and my awesome massage with Nicole. I really enjoyed the mask, steam treatment, and the scalp massage that came along with it. Everything that she put on my face smelled so good and it was so relaxing! My massage therapist Nicole also went above and beyond what I had expected from a spa enviornment. She addressed all my needs and really listened to everything that I said. I was really impressed with the trigger point therapy that she used on my neck and shoulder area. She also let me pick between 3 different essential oils and I picked the green tea one and it was wonderful. I enjoyed every minute of it and I felt so rejuvenated. They have really good rates for local AZ residents and I will be coming back for some more services in the future.",positive
"Easy to schedule an appointment online. Great deals for AZ residents so I could actually get treatments at a nice hotel without paying exorbitant prices. Just like at the hotel, all the staff are pleasant and accommodating. My facial was very soothing and I got useful feedback on my skincare regimen. I absolutely loved my massage. If I lived in Phoenix I would return to that masseuse regularly (can't remember his name, sorry). And if you're not staying at the hotel they still let you use facilities for the day - gorgeous pool, lagoon, lounge areas, fire pits, and free wine hour at 5. And there IS a shower available at the spa - as well as amazing robes.",positive
"I received a gift certificate for there Spa Cation services for my birthday. The massage left me feeling very disappointed, it was supposed to be a full 60 minutes but only lasted 40. It was my first time and I was not impressed at all. Then the mani was supposed to be 50 min and she was done is 25, I also have numerous cuts on my cuticals. I asked for a simple french manicure on my toes, the white tips are so wide and there was nail polish smeared all over the ends of my toes. I actually stopped in at another salon on my way home and had them redone. I would never recommend this spa to anyone. So disappointing!",negative
"I will not return to this spa. There were so many problems, some of which I didn't discover until after I left. The biggest problem was the receptionist. I called several days before and ordered the $99.00 Arizona special and an eyebrow wax. Long story short, she never schedule my eyebrow wax, than she charged me for the more expensive $169.00 treatment instead of the $99.00! When I questioned her she said I recived the more expense treatment so that is the one I had to pay for!!! What!! I promptly told her that is not what I reserved and the customer should not have to monitor the treatment regime!. ( I have never had a facial before so I didn't even know what to expect). I spoke to the supervisor and she argued with me as well. When I told her this was terrible customer service she said ""would you feel better if I charged you the $99.00 price? yesssssss since that is what I reserved and what I expected to pay. The bill still came out much higher that expected. When I questioned that she said the customer has to pay the 20% tip based off the orignal non sale price! Wow I think a $60 tip was crazy. Also, when I got home I noticed the girl who waxed my eyebrows burned my skin under my eyebrow. I had a scab for several days. Than the manicure I had started to chip the very next day. Wow. I will stick to doing this myself. This was a very stressful visit and I will never make that mistake again.",negative
In town and looking forward to a relaxing spa day and ended up very disappointed. The massages were mediocre. We weren't staying at the hotel and there was no place to shower and get ready. We drove about 25 miles from our hotel to go to the SPA and hangout in Scottsdale only to have to drive 25 miles from or so back to our hotel. We had planned to have drinks and lunch at the hotel but couldnt. When booking the spa knew we werent staying there and I feel should have mentioned that there is no place to shower after the massage. Sad...,negative
"This review is for a treatment I received in February of this year. Sorry for my tardiness. I was at the Firesky for a conference. After hearing a number of conference attendees raving about the treatments they received at Jurlique, I was looking forward to getting in for a massage. I was scheduled at the end of the day, so I was a bit apprehensive about what the quality would be like - you know how the end of a workday can be. Was I silly to be worried! Jurlique is tucked into an building on the corner of the Firesky lot. It's got a small waiting area stocked with the typical spa goods and a few seats. An okay place for a short wait, and Enna, the front office clerk, was very welcoming. When Kayleen came out to introduce herself as my therapist, I was a bit nervous. I'm used to getting worked on by sturdy Samoan gals, not tall willowy blondes. But my nerves were soothed the instant Kayleen the Massage Ninja plied her trade. I couldn't put my finger on what she was doing that was not only relaxing me but loosening me up until I asked Kayleen about her techniques. She combines massage with acupressure, and it works wonders! Based on the experiences of our conference attendees, I'd say anyone at Jurlique can deliver a great massage. Based on my experience, I can say that Jurlique should do whatever they can to keep Kayleen on staff!",positive
"Two words: Vodkatini scrub...just get it. They scrub you down with this amazingly wonderful mix of watermelon, basil and vodka (yes, vodka) and then you rinse and they give you a massage of you choice...I did the 80 minute. Highly recommend and the woman in front (Ina, I think) is very sweet and knowledgeable.",positive
"I WANTED to love Jurlique. I took 3 friends for a girls weekend in February. We all received facials & massages. Masseuse was excellent, but for the price you would be better served going a couple blocks north to another spa that starts with a D and ends with an E. The aesthetician was terrible; 1. she did not have the room set up before I arrived, 2. she continuously & loudly banged things into the copper sink and 3. Her skill level was not at what I would expect for a $100+ facial. Lastly the woman at the desk was on the phone when I walked up to check out and put my purse up on the counter. She gave me a dirty look like I was a naughty child, I promptly removed my purse, stepped back from the desk & waited for her to get off the phone. When she finished with her client on the phone she smiled coyly and said ""may I help you NOW?"". Get off it lady - I'm adult enough to spend $300 bucks at your spa don't look at me like I'm bothering you!",negative
"My friends and I came here for Spa week and it was such a fantastic experience! It was a good thing we made our appointments ahead of time, because it was sure busy. There was a minor scheduling snafu but Jeff, the spa director, resolved it quickly. The spa is connected to the Firesky Resort which is a great place to stay for a weekend getaway. My facial was $50 (spa week promotion) but normally is $140. My aesthetician Jessica was fabulous! She explained all the products she used and didn't push products on me. I also got a massage for $50 but normally I think it's close to $130. They automatically add a 20% tip to your total. My massage therapist really loosened all the knots in my back and even gave me an option of the oil fragrance too. I picked lavender. The only issue I have is that this spa is that it's a ''boutique'' spa. So it doesn't have a sauna or waiting/tea room. If you come for a day trip, I believe you can get a day pass that allows access to the pool. I'm not one to splurge on spa treatments but couldn't pass it up for spa week. They offer plenty of other services like mani/pedicures and specialized massages & facials. Will definitely return again if they have more special deals available.",positive
"I had a gift certificate, so I decided to treat myself to a spa day and I'm so glad I did! First, I had an 80 minute massage/body scrub with Nicole! She was awesome! I felt completely well taken care of and pampered! Her touch was just right and the few times that it was too intense for me, I asked her to go a little lighter and she did. The body scrub was phenomenal! My skin now feels like velvet...and if you are from AZ, you know how skin can get. The surroundings are luxurious...loved the claw foot bathtubs! Then, I had my first facial ever with Lindsey. What an experience! It was a 50 minutes of scrub, enzyme, mask, moisturizer, massage and a whole lot of other things! Again, my face feels like velvet, really clean and looks radiant! Both practitioners were very professional and sweet! They really enjoy working at that particular spa. I also liked the receptionist with the pink hair...she was very helpful with choosing skin care products to take home. They offer some terrific deals during the summer months and they clued me in on spa week in October. I hope to be back soon! Thanks ladies! Gina",positive
"Yes, one solitary star and just because I cannot give you a perfect zero. Lets break this down. Service: I got a manicure and a pedicure. On Spa day, the total was a 100 or so dollars. Now at this price I expect one thing at the least. Cut my nails right ! The lady that did them, cut my nails straight across. And by this I mean my nails looked like a box, they did not curve along the spend natural line as one would expect. So for a 100 bucks you cant even cut my nails right ? Seriously a wtf moment So ok I forgive you for screwing up my pedicure, but when I point out to you that my nails were not done right on the manicure, you spend less than 5 seconds with a file and still leave it the same way, you should not be doing anyone's nails. (And then Cheryl or whatever her name was tells me how she hates doing nails!! More wtfs follow in my in internal monologue!) So I guess what I am getting at, is do not bother going to Jurlique. Even if they let you go in for free, you's be spending money or time or both getting it fixed. Yes, the place was bad enough to make me come out and review this place. Argh. What a flipping waste.",negative
"My sister and I went here on Sunday for spa week. When we arrived the receptionist asked if it was our first time. My sister had been there before, but I hadn't. All that got me was some paper work to fill out, every other spa I have been to usually gives a little tour of the place. Luckily we arrived about 15 minutes before our services as there are only TWO chairs inside to wait for your service, everyone who arrived after us, about 5 other girls, had to sit outside, and it was roughly 94 yesterday. The massage itself was nice. I had Seth and he did a really great job. I told him I liked a lot of pressure and that my back was jacked. He spent a lot of time on my back. the one thing I was sad he didn't do was the head rub and ear lobe pinching, but whatev. The room we were in was amazing. It had a huge soaking tub, shower and bathroom area. Very nice. Will I go back? Maybe for spa week...but probably not for a full service treatment.",positive
I love to save up to splurge on a spa treatment here. It's reasonably priced compared to some of the other resorts in Scottsdale. I especially love the Vichy Nirvana Massage.,positive
"Jurlique is a great little spa in the heart of Scottsdale. Not too big, not too small. Like Little Red Riding Hood would say, ""just right."" It is a nicely appointed spa with reasonably priced services and a professional, kind staff. I'm not a big spa person -- in fact, I've only had one other spa treatment prior to my visit at Jurlique -- but chose to indulge a little on my vacation. First up was a pedicure. Now, I'll reveal something that most people are shocked to hear: I have never had a pedicure! Yes, I know, weird. But, hey, why spend the cash when you can do it yourself. Well, yeah, that was my motto then, but after my pedicure at Jurlique, I've decided to indulge in the luxury of having your feet massaged and toes painted every once in awhile. It was divine! Second on my spa list was a lovely massage. Again, it was my first time, so I wasn't sure what to expect and a little worried I'd end up in more pain afterward. But, my masseuse was very professional, asking me what muscle to concentrate on and the intensity of the massage. It was delightful I left Jurlique spa so very relaxed and rejuvenated -- exactly what you'd hope for after a spa weekend.",positive
"I really wanted to like this place, because I'm a huge fan of Jurlique products. I got the customized facial. The process was fine; I was surprised I was not offered any extractions, which I've always gotten at every facial I've had. One star for the facial, which came with a short shoulder massage. And of course I loved the products. One star for the nice pool area and convenience of having an Italian restaurant on the property. Spa services mean 20% discount at the resto. One of the pools has a beach area with sand and all. That was nice. The spa itself... not so much. I understand this is not a huge spa, but I expect it to offer things like robes and shower facilities if they invite you to use the hotel's pools. I had called ahead when I booked, and was told that I would be free to use the pool and showers, etc. When I got there, I was told that it's Spa Week and we couldn't use the showers or get a robe or change in their facilities. The woman at the spa's front desk was unhelpful and actually made my friends and I feel very stressed because of her rushed attitude. I understand that Spa Weeks are often like packing cattle into treatment rooms and everything's chaotic, but isn't the point of it to introduce potential customers to the spa and make them want to come by for full priced treatments? After the way the woman treated us (as if she didn't have any time to deal with us discount-paying minions), my friends and i won't be coming back. I do, however, still love Jurlique products. But I'll stick to applying them to my face at home, where I don't get any attitude.",negative
"I think this is an excellent spa for what it is...but you need to understand what you are getting into. This is not a mega-spa, with big soaking areas and lounge areas and whatnot. You walk into a small reception area, get checked in and hang out a bit, and are then taken to your treatment room. This is a pretty large and luxurious room, you have a place to sit and a shower and your treatment area, but that's it. There are maybe a half dozen, or eight, I'm not sure. But this is not the place for a big group of friends, or to spend a day. It's just not that kind of place. But it is a place for high-class treatments from nice people. There were four of us (two couples) so we had a broad range of experiences with different treatments and massages and we all came out very happy. I guess we had six people work with us and all of us thought the attendants were talented and very pleasant. So if that is what you are looking for--it was what we were looking for--you should be very satisfied. Think of Jurlique as a place to spend an hour or 2 on a lazy afternoon, then get a drink outside someplace and head to dinner, and you will be happy. Think you are going to show up and 8am and be poured into your limo home at 5pm and you are probably going to be disappointed.",positive
"On Friday I spent my day at Jurlique Spa in Scottsdale. It was my first day off in a long time and I was excited to spend it relaxing. This was a 65 mile drive for me and my visit totaled $245.00 (that was the half off price). I know its taboo to list prices but I think its relevant to this review because its no small chunk of change for anyone in today's economy. I needed a few days to cool down before I wrote this review. Jurlique opened their business to the yelp community and offered half off on their services. For this alone I am grateful. As I walked in I was greeted by a very pushy and ""cold"" receptionist. I was very rushed by her. She didn't introduce me to the establishment or befriend me as a new customer. It was go go go. Following this, I was on a rapid assembly line by the rest of the staff. They started me off with the Signature Harmony Massage. This was literally a gewfest of rushed body oiling and back pinching. The pressure was light to medium but more light. This would have been nice to know prior to agreeing to the massage. I workout and I have knots, deep ones, that require some pressure other than light surface friction. I mentioned this but either she was unable to increase the pressure or she was very adamant about doing the specific massage. She was also very very nervous. Its difficult to explain but she just was. I don't think she has done many male massages. She was a very nice girl but the massage was horrible. It had no rhythm or flow. Nothing about this ""massage"" was relaxing and I felt like all I got for my time and money was half a bottle of scented oil. Next was the Intense Recovery Facial. This was done very well by Lindsey. She made an intelligent effort to get to know my skin patterns and truly adapted her treatment for my skin. She was confident and had a very good work ethic. I could tell that she knew her craft well. This included: exfoliating washes, steaming, painful but necessary extractions, a great mask, and lots of moisturizing. When she was finished I looked like someone pushed me into a gravel pit....and I couldn't be more thrilled. It's a good sign of a good facial, it is! Had this been my only experience here the over all review would have been much better. (My skin looks great this Monday morning!) To finish off my day I had Jurlique's Wildflower Pedi. I get Pedi's on a regular bases and I have never in my life paid $70 for one but I was looking forward to seeing what I've been missing out on. At half off this regular price I couldn't resist! I'm not going to get into too much detail about this experience because there is none. The water was scented and that's about the only nice thing I can say about it. The primary reason for my pedicures is to keep the bottom of my feet smooth and healthy. I noticed in Yoga yesterday that I need to make time this week to get an actual pedicure. -Sigh At the end of my visit the receptionist added the 20% mandatory gratuity (which should just be a called a fee of $70) to my bill and didn't ask me if I wanted to add more ( I would have liked to tip extra for the facial). The bill had no place to add an extra tip. This really bothered me. I don't understand what the target audience is for this Spa. Its not men under 30. Don't forget Jurlique we have money to spend too. I suggest that Jurlique take a step back and evaluate their quality of services. Just because its in Scottsdale and just because its expensive dose not excuse you from striving for consistent quality for every customer. In a down-economy, where services like this are becoming a rare luxury again, many places are offering a better experience for a fraction of the cost. If your going to keep your prices up there you better WOW each and every customer that walks in that door.",negative
"Didn't even get to go on a tour... Scheduled a tour on Saturday and on my there, I get a call that it's cancelled. I was told it's was due to wind. I get it, things happen. Reschedule the tour for Sunday. 30 mins before I need to be there, the tour gets cancelled again! This time it's due to mechanical issues. No apologies, just a refund that will be issued on Monday. I'm just irritated that they cancelled the tours, so close to the start time. Each time I was on my way there. I'm also frustrated that I didn't receive an apology for the inconvenience. It would have been nice if they offered a discount for a future cruise. I guess since they are the only cruise company on the lake, they can get away with that. Luckily, I live in Vegas so I'm driving my own car. However, if I was staying on the strip and on my way I would be super pissed. I would suggest renting a boat with some friends, instead going on the cruise. More flexibility and at least you'll get to go on a boat.",negative
A fantastic tour! It doesn't say it online but locals get a discount when you call in for a reservation. I believe it was $6.50 off the daytime sight seeing cruise. I'd recommend if you go during the day & want to sit on the top level bring sunscreen. Even on a sunny 70 degree day it gets very hot.,positive
"Clean boat with pleasant staff. Three tiers with the crowd rushing to the top for best viewing. Beverages sold on board. Online reservations not so easy for parties of 8+ but phone service was exceptional. They do allow smoking on board which we did not like, thus not 5 stars.",positive
"Got a gift certificate for Xmas (non-expiring) last year and tried to book twice earlier in the spring. Was told they cruise wasn't running due to mechanical difficulty. Was able to book about three weeks ago for today and got there but the boat broke down and the cruise was cancelled for safety/mechanical reasons. The person in charge (not the captain) told all of us the brunch was on them. They said everyone was getting refunded....except me....my ticket - gift was evidently bought through cloud9 last Xmas and Armark said they hadn't been paid the cloud9 yet and therefore I couldn't get a refund...because it would go back to the people that bought the certificate. Anyway, to make a long story short I ended up with a gift certificate that now expires in a year ...i'm sure those that bought my original certificate would not have bought it if they had known it expired in a year and who knows when I'll actually be able to use it....the food was good and better to cancel the cruise than to be stuck in lake mead somewhere.",negative
"We enjoyed our cruise on the Desert Princess today. Initially, we were scheduled to go yesterday, but we got a call the evening before telling us that it was canceled due to Highwinds. To make up for the change of plans, they booked us for today and gave us a free photo package. Be sure to ask for the senior citizen discount - if you qualify - for the cruise. We enjoyed being on different parts of the boat and listening to the pre-recorded tour. While on the back of the boat it was more difficult to hear but when we got on the second deck and sat at the front, we could hear much better. We did not have much interaction with the staff while on the boat. The gals in the store/shop were very friendly and pleasant. I would do this again if I had the opportunity, and I am sure we would enjoy the dinner cruise as well. We learned of a lot of interesting facts about Lake Mead and the surrounding area as well as the Hoover dam.",positive
Had a great time on the cruise. Only a small group so it was fun meeting new people. Highly recommend you take this cruise for brunch or dinner. Cheers!,positive
"We really enjoyed the Lake Mead Cruise. It was our first time there and we were running late trying to get to the marina and they were so nice to wait for us. the staff was very friendly,the boat is big, very roomy, there is a kitchen and bar on board and the tour is narrated. We had a really good time.",positive
Best way to see Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. Three decks. Two are air conditioned. Food available on the boat. Reasonable priced hamburgers. Not fine dining but good food. Book ahead as they do fill up. Lots of tour buses come from Las Vegas. Air conditioned place to wait for boarding. Recorded tour. The boat Captain turns boat around so both sides get a great view of the power plant area. Plenty of time for pictures. Boat does run on time.,positive
"The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was fun if you're looking for something lay-back and relaxing. Service was was very pleasant, food was surprising good, and the experience being on a cruise dinner on Lake Mead was definitely a fun experience! I would advise everyone to experience it, even if it seems cheesy. You won't regret it! Locals and/or tourist, definitely go and try it out. We came onto this cruise as a birthday celebration for one of my husband's friend. I didn't even know this existed. The cost for this experience was $61.50 per person, with this you get admission onto the boat, a pre-fix three course meal, and a cruise to Hoover Dam. If you want to see what they are offering on their pre-fix menu, they have it posted on their website. I had the Broiled Lemon Pepper Salmon and for dessert I had the chocolate souffl√©. The salad was generic but good, nothing to gush over; the salmon was surprising good, very flavorful and nicely cooked; the dessert, for something that seems to come out of a pre-made box (which I am assuming, I could be wrong), it was very delicious! It was soft, warm, and gooey. After dinner, you can roam around the boat and watch the sunset over Hoover Dam, surrounded by the mountains/cliffs. For the cost of the cruise and dinner, I would definitely encourage you give it a try. It was a fun experience! If another friend of ours choose to have a birthday party there, I would definitely go back. What a creative way to celebrate a birthday.",positive
Relaxing way to see beautiful Lake Mead and the Hoover dam. This is our third time out on the Desert Princess and we always take new people out here for a different experience than the strip.,positive
"Had a great experience with this cruise and my lady and I actually got engaged on it! I called ahead from NYC and made reservations for a Sunday brunch cruise, as we were traveling to Las Vegas and Boulder City. I gave them another call the day before and made a few more specific arrangements and what not, and everyone was helpful. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar. They have a few draft beers, cans, and some mixed drinks. Seemed pretty cheap (compared to NY at least), and our bartender was friendly and let us run a tab to the boat once brunch started. Before we ate, we secretly went up to the top deck, where I surprised my girlfriend good! It went over really well and Shelli, our server, walked up with mimosas and took a few photos for us. She was fantastic! They also made an announcement to the ship and everyone was cool and didn't embarrass me (too much). The food was good! I was pretty distracted and excited, but I had some sausage, crepes, eggs benedict, bacon, and all that other good stuff. The entire staff was really cool. Carla, Shelli, thanks a bunch! Also, the captain and his apprentice took a photo of us in the cockpit, which was cool. We got some souvenirs after and one shirt was too small for my fianc√©e, and they were really cool about exchanging it the next day. Overall a great job and a wonderful experience!",positive
Went on daily cruise today with 2 friends loved the cruise workers were very nice cruise was great the only thing they charged you to go in complex to park in dirt lot I think if you pay for cruise they should wave the 10 dollar fee to park in dirt lot have to wash car after I left but the cruise was great,positive
"I have been on the dinner cruise a couple of times and I love it everytime, I always have the steak, the food is delicious, the view is beautiful and everything is always great. I like outdoors and all the times I have went I have a great time.",positive
Decent buffet and unlimited champagne for the brunch cruise. Beautiful scenery. Polite and helpful wait staff. Top deck of the boat was very relaxing. We enjoyed ourselves very much. We would go again :),positive
"We went on the sunday brunch cruise and it was everything we expected and then some!!! All the crew members were very nice. The boat was gorgeous, The scenery was gorgeous, my girlfriend was gorgeous. Was worried about the brunch buffet being not up to par.. But it exceeded my expectations! Food was excellent. Champagne and orange juice ( mimosas ) provided unlimited! We were the 2nd table to get the food so the food was still hot and fresh when we ate. Didnt hear anyone complain about the temp of the food after us . Very laid back and only like 3 young children so it was very quiet and relaxing. Would do this or a dinner cruise again!",positive
"What a joke! The only reason I can say anything good about this cruise was the weather was beautiful and I didn't pay full price. Everything else was awful, parking, staff, everything! There was no water in the marina which meant no bathrooms. Isn't that a health department violation? Run very far away from this. Sitting in a casino losing money is a better bet.",negative
"Not impressed. We departed 25 minutes late, so don't plan a tight schedule for after the 90 minutes. Air conditioning appears to be inadequate. It's the Nevada desert for God's sake! Long line for the bar. Canned narration is hard to hear. They allow smoking, so the smokers smogging away up top were happy (Hack, hack! Cough, cough!) The only upside is you get to see Hoover Dam for about 10 minutes for photo ops. You could just drive a few minutes further and view Hoover Dam from a viewpoint off the road for free. Otherwise, Lake Mead is a rocky-rimmed wasteland with it's own special beauty that gets old after 10 minutes. It is what it is. The extra star is for the staff. All friendly and efficient. Oh, almost forgot. There is a $10 fee to get into the National Recreation Area. It is good for 7 days, but big woop if you are just coming for the cruise.",negative
"I love taking cruises on Lake Mead on the Desert Princess with Lake Mead Cruises. Have gone many times over the years and have never had anything but a great time. The staff has always been excellent, and the views are simply amazing! Seeing the Hoover Dam and the bypass bridge from the water point of view is really cool, and you get pictures that you can't from anywhere else. I have been on both the sightseeing day cruises and the dinner cruises. They are both fun and relaxing. Have also been on both the paddle wheel boats in Tahoe (managed by the same company) and suggest them as well. I suggest that you check out downtown Boulder City either before or after the Lake Mead cruise as its very cool and nothing like Las Vegas. There is also a really cool Hoover Dam museum in the historic Boulder Dam Hotel that is definitely worth seeing, even if you have already been through the tour at the dam.",positive
"Hubby treated me to a champagne brunch ferry ride in Lake Mead, whoopee! Been wanting to try this out and it did not disappoint. For special occasions, make sure you book in advance because they fill out fast. Also make sure you come early. There's a grace period of about 15-20 minutes for boarding but when we left, one family missed the ride and had to console themselves with taking photos of the boat. The ferry has 3 floors - 2 air-conditioned indoor floors and an open deck at the top. The views are better on the 2nd floor dining area. The champagne, orange juice and coffee are free flowing and good, while brunch served had mostly breakfast items that fall under a tolerable gray area - not great but not horrendous. There was salad, fruit, scrambled eggs, potatoes, french toast, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, some weird sweet and sour noodle dish, blueberry muffins, yogurt parfait and corn cake. Eggs benedict were also served but with a 10minute wait. If you are a stickler for good food, you can skip out on the meals and take the mid-day food-less cruise. If you are ok with staple breakfast buffets, it's a nice opportunity to chat with family over food and enjoy the ride/views. The best time to go on this cruise is when it's not too hot, cold or windy. Because the winds were bad that day, we could not enter the canyon where we could see the part of Hoover dam more closely. After you finish your meal, there is enough time to explore the top deck and take photos before the boat docks. The dining area and bathrooms are clean, and service is prompt. And for an extra $20, you can purchase a large photo print out and photo magnet of your family in front of the boat. Definitely a must-book in Vegas! (p.s. if they improved their food, this cruise deserves a perfect 5 star rating!)",positive
"Great idea for those wanting to see the Hoover Dam 1.5 hour trip and access only allowed by boat! If youre up for it...mention that you have come before and that you were unable to cruise, they will give you 25% off!! Full bar and food options on board!",positive
"HIGHLY suggest!! Amazing cruise, narration, drinks, and food! The prices were extremely reasonable and they offer a military discount, as well as AAA. All of the staff was super friendly and very welcoming. I am so glad that my mom talked us in to doing this cruise!",positive
"We went for the champagne brunch on Mother's Day. I was surprised how clean and well kept EVERYTHING was! The people were wonderful and attentive. We enjoyed every minute of it. The ONLY suggestion I would make is that child-friendly beverages could be ordered/delivered to the table. I thought they said the bartender would come around, but we never saw her and couldn't get anything to drink other than coffee, oj, and champagne. I think we will make it an annual event! Another praise is that my card apparently charged twice. Not only did an employee call me to verify then credit back my card, but she also noticed I did not get a local's discount (I didn't know there was one!) and also credited back the difference! I was really impressed by the customer service.",positive
"I always enjoy the Lake Mead cruise. It's nice to do the day after running up and down the strip. It's an hour and a half of chilling out and enjoying some good views. Had little issue at the dock today but Lisa turned what could have been a frustrating experience, into a great time! I would suggest a little less narration. It was a lot of loud speaker time when I'd rather just enjoy the scenary. Maybe just some interesting facts along the way with music would be better. Either way, it's a must do if you need some quality time away from the strip.",positive
"We went on this cruise last weekend as a family outing and it was great! Totally worth the $20 per person to get out on the lake and enjoy a serene, informative, and relaxing cruise. It was a great refresher after doing the typical strip and gambling scene. It was a nice 2 hour ride that was a bit blustery at times but very scenic and lovely. It takes you close to the damn and gives you a spectacular view of the dam and the new bridge. They do serve food on the boat but we decided to eat elsewhere. I highly recommend the cruise for those looking for a cheap and relaxing afternoon out on the water.",positive
"I don't think this is getting enough love. Maybe I'm biased since I used to cruise around on a paddleboat like this one on the Pittsburgh rivers as a kid. How can you not like a casual day on the lake? Here's what you need to know: this is meant to be a relaxing, sit-back and enjoy the afternoon kind of ride. It's on Lake Mead so you certainly can't be expecting something exciting to pop up during the cruise. It's also a paddleboat so you can't be expecting it to go very fast. It's meant for you to have a chill afternoon in Boulder City. We, of course, had to go on one of the windiest days so far this year. And I, of course, had to think I was going to look cute and wear a dress on our little afternoon date. Do not do this! It is not smart and everyone will stare at you like you are a crazy person. Yes, we had extra wind the day we were there, but I can imagine that it's windy on the lake most days. Because of my fashion don't, we didn't explore too much of the boat. We ran up to the 2nd floor and grabbed something to eat and then as I clung onto my dress for dear life we went to the 3rd floor to really enjoy the views. We completely missed the first floor. There is a prerecorded guide that talks about the history and geology of the area when the cruise first starts. I'm kind of bummed we missed it since I can be a bit of a nerd, but I was starving and my stomach always comes first. We were able to order off the menu on the 2nd floor but unfortunately there weren't a lot of options for vegetarians. We ordered some snacks and I decided that I couldn't pass up a frozen strawberry margarita. I only reserve frozen cocktails for days when I feel like a tourist, and this was one of those days. The second floor was just to the full point when we arrived but cleared out after 20 minutes. On the top floor there are some patio furniture-esque chairs to sit in and soak up the sights. I decided to not let the wind win and relax. There were plenty of interesting rock formations to see as well as a new perspective of the Hoover Dam (down below vs. from up top). If you're lucky you can steer the boat for .82 seconds like I did! In all, this is a fun afternoon date or a good spot for a family. Prices for drinks and food are a little more than I would normally spend but not outrageous. I am docking one star, however, since I do feel the tickets are overpriced. I got a discount on mine and feel like it was worth the price for what I received.",positive
"This is a review for the dinner cruise. Overall, the cruise around the lake during sunset was nice. PRO: view of the sunset was amazing. CON: food was average. also, i know that the day cruises give you information about the lake and the dam, and was informed the dinner cruise would have that too, but that wasn't the case. so i was disappointed. and if they didn't charge that much for their photos ($20?), i might've bought one. now, i went on the cruise with a 25% off coupon, so this is reflected in my 4 star review. if i had paid full price, i would've given it 3 stars.",positive
"As locals, we finally decided to check out this attraction. I noticed the another Yelp reviewer mention the locals discount of 25%. There is also a coupon attached to this attraction's brochure that offers BOGO pricing for up to 6 tickets. We were able to use this coupon's code for out on-line ticket purchase. You are required to present this coupon upon check in at the counter where you get your boarding pass for the boat. Just like a real cruise, they make you take a photo before boarding even if you tell the photographer you do not want your photo taken who curtly told me you have to have it taken. My wife and I were guessing maybe its a Cost Guard requirement for ID purposes should something happen to the boat......besides being able to charge you $20 for the photo when your cruise docks again. Yeah, we ended up buying the photo. Since it was really hot the day we went, July 20, we chose to sit inside rather than roast on the top deck. The second deck consisted of tables and chairs and were filled up with passengers who had a lunch included with their cruise. From what I could observe, the lunch consisted of a cold deli sandwich, a bag of chips and an apple or orange. Unsure if a beverage was provided also. We ended up on the first level at two tables next to the window nearest the front of the boat but next to the door the crew kept using to get to the engine room, so it was quite noisy whenever they opened the door. The sound system sucks, at least where we sat, and were unable to hear any of the narration of the lake or dam or other information being provided. When the boat gets to the dam, be prepared to snap your photos of the dam as the boat does not slow down when turning around or stop for a few minutes for photos to be taken. Overall, we were glad we did this, despite a few shortcomings and would do this again but not at the full pricing. It was with the discounted pricing however.",positive
"Like L.T., I also was looking to get away from the La Vegas neon jungle and experience some nature. My son and I got a shuttle ride over to Lake Mead and then hopped on the boat for the cruise. Coming as we were from an ocean and bay environment, it was fascinating for my boy to experience a lake out in the middle of the desert. We enjoyed seeing Hoover Dam from down below since we had previously driven over the top of it. The Lake Mead tour was especially informative as to the geography, archeology and impact of lowering Lake water levels that threaten the ecology of the region. There were glimpses of birds, fish, and native plants. I like that some history of the area Native Americans were also incorporated into the tour. Didn't really buy anything or go drinking at the bar. I would recommend this tour highly. In my opinion, there is not much of value to be found in Las Vegas but if you can get out into this beautiful region, there is much enjoyment to be found in the great Nevada outdoors.",positive
"This company offers a decent cruise on Lake Mead. I was expecting a tour around the entire lake, but they really only take you from the marina over to Hoover Dam and then back. Still, it's a nice relaxing way to spend an hour and a half. Full disclosure: I didn't pay for the cruise. I probably wouldn't pay the $24 ($18 for locals). Also, it's probably a bad idea to go during the heat of summer.",negative
"Food: 4.5 stars Service: 4 stars Value: 4 stars It is located in Boulder City, NV, not in Las Vegas. Just take 215-East from the Strip and it took about 30-40 minutes drive. We picked the mid-day cruise that was $22 per person. It costed $5 per car to enter the Lead Mead site. We went on Saturday and the boat was boarding on time at noon. It was not crowded at all. They gave out each person a free hotdog (""cold""dog), a bag of chip, and one bottle of water in the lower level of the ship. Since they didn't look very good, we decided to spend some money and get the real food from the bar. We ordered a turkey melt sandwich $6.99 and a glass of bloody mary $8. The bartender put nice amount of vodka in the drink and it tasted very good. Surprisingly, the turkey melt sandwich was very yummy too! The lake view was awesome. The cruise took about 2 hours in Lake Mead and we could see the back of the Hoover Dam. It was very nice to get away from the casinos and enjoying some nature.",positive
"Very open bright area, nice new and clean. Staff was friendly and attentive. Have variety of beers, stout was cold and smooth",positive
Love the set up of Lake Wilcox Brewing's Brewery Pub! Bright and spacious! Just so enjoyable to have a drink right at the bar or in one of the communal tables. Have a sampler flight or even a pint in their tap room. Here you will find their usual beers which are available at LCBO. I personally would recommend giving their Small Batch Limited Release which changes regularly a try. And the best part is to pick up some cans and fill up a growler right here directly at source. You cannot get more local than this! And there is not too many local brewery in the area. Check their instagram feed for the most updated specials and events. BTW there is usually freshly shucked oysters available on Saturday from the Cannon Oyster Co and lunch service from Thursday to Sunday.,positive
"Came here for their brewery tour which was excellent! The fellow giving the tour is the son of one of the founders which was pretty cool - we were able to hear the full history of how Lake Wilcox Brewing came to be. Very thorough explanation of how craft beer is made. Something about still having some manual processes adds a personal touch feel to the beers. The service was very friendly and quick. We tried their beer flights which is a great way to sample their selections if you, like us, haven't had their beer before. My favourites were: 1. Lake Wilcox Belgian Blonde - Fruity like passion fruit 2. Lake Wilcox Golden Hour Stout - Creamy with caramel and coffee notes. Absolutely delicious! Like a dessert beer, if that's even a thing. 3. Lake Wilcox American Brown Ale - Sweet, not too strong tasting despite being a darker beer. You can purchase their beers here in single cans or cases along with some other merch such as t-shirts and pint glasses. I'm glad to have discovered this brewery and the fact that it's such a short distance from me makes it even sweeter! I will definitely be back here when I'm in the mood for some beer burps (lol).",positive
"We came here on a Saturday afternoon prior to meeting friends for a birthday party. It was pretty easy to get to off the highway. From the outside you do not realize how huge this establishment is! I really liked the feel inside, clean, minimalist. You can do tours of the brewery but we came to try the goods and pairings. They were serving arancini balls that day which happens to be a favourite of mine and they were delicious. We both got a flight of different beers to try and share, and I was extremely impressed. I really loved every single one. I have been trying a lot more craft beers the last couple years so I have a pretty solid idea of what I enjoy and recommend and I highly recommend trying this place out. I was shocked to find my favourite was the bitters. What I enjoyed most was that they were all distinguishable, the flavours were all so different. To add to the fun they have jenga on every table, what a great idea!",positive
"This family owned brewery is an absolute staple if you're looking for a brewery tour. The brewery, having only been at this location for a little over a year, boasts great beer, rich history, and a friendly environment.",positive
"I've been following these guys before they even built a brewery. Summertime is the time to get DRUUUUNK. Err, I mean.. to have a nice wholesome sipping experience. The first sip of beer I've ever had from them was a new level of excitement that I couldn't get over. The owners and creators of wilcox are gems - so sweet, so nice and definitely know a good beer. Honestly, sometimes I just crave the crispness of lake wilcox. It's perfect for a summer day and they offer tons here with their flight of beers and you can bring some home too, and trust me you'll definitely want to. Wilcox offers some of the most refreshing beers I've ever had, and trust me, I'm a fanatic for a good hop or two. They have all kinds of beer, and even if you don't like beer, they have this very light raspberry one that taste more like a cider - SO GOOD. See, THIS is how people get smashed. When your alcohol doesn't taste like alcohol, we're all in trouble. They also have IPAs and honestly I don't like dark beer at all (like seriously, if I drink Guinness, I'll die of a stroke) but for some reason, wilcox's aren't that bad. There aren't that many breweries in the GTA, so having one in vaughan is definitely a great thing. Perfect spot for a date, a adventure or simply.. you know it's coming.. to crack a cold one with da boys.",positive
"Got a groupon deal for the tour, 2 tasting flights and souvenir glasses and was excited. These guys have been around for longer than I knew. They couldn't stay in Richmond Hill by Lake Wilcox due to Town restrictions so that's a shame but its nice they are still in central GTA and by Vaughan mills mall. I love their friendly culture of helping out other small breweries starting out as they had experienced before them at their brewery. Sharing is caring! I'm not a real beer fan so I can't say much about hops and taste but my husband is a fan. Easy afternoon to learn some factoids about beer, sip some local brew from the tasting flight, try some really tasty fresh oysters and their sauces and just chill.",positive
"My boyfriend and I were recently on vacation in Toronto. Bought a tour on Groupon and so glad we did! I'm currently pregnant so I couldn't try any of the beers, but my boyfriend tried everything on tap and was really impressed. His favorite was the Black Hops and bought a 6 pack to take back home. The tour was very informative and our guide was great! We are from Milwaukee, WI and have gone on many brewery tours, but this tour actually had info we have never heard before which was awesome. After the tour we hung out in their tasting room and had very nice conversations with both of the staff that was working. If you live in this area, you really should check out the brewery between the excellent customer service and awesome beer it's a great place to visit.",positive
"It's honestly a sin that the boys from Lake Wilcox have had their own bricks and mortar brewery and tasting room/retail store for nearly a year and they've yet to receive a single Yelp review... I mean COME ON VAUGHAN!! Support your very own! I've been following the growth of this GTA-born and bred brewery since I first came upon them when they only had demo cans for show at the King City Craft Beer and Food Truck Festival. It all began with their original Vienna lager ""Mad Quacker Amber Lager"", and shortly grew to their ""Black Hops IPA"" and now they boast 11 unique flavoured beers which and continue to grow by a new release each and every month. Their brewery/tap room and retail are massive, the production facility which is in full view from the tap room extends the length of nearly a soccer field. The tap/room and retail is no slouch either, with seating for 50+ and a long live-edge wood bar all under massive 35-foot ceilings and floor to ceiling windows with views to the outside. Overall, they've captured that cool industrial feel and planted it in the heart of Vaughan (literally on the doorstep of Vaughan Mills Mall). Best of all is the growler situation here, of their 11 on tap varieties you can score a growler in your choice of 7 of those varieties. Check in regularly for growler deals! Due to their convenient location just off HWY 400 N, Lake Wilcox is an ideal stop on the way up to cottage country to stock up. I'm a huge fan of supporting local spots like this - you should be too! Don't be a Quack - get your ass in here for a tasting flight.",positive
Amazing experience and package for discovering Vegas and the surrounding area. Brittany and James were super active and involved with the Strip Trips every step of the way. I would of loved to see this for a week to have more time to do the activities recommended. Hope others find strip trips an amazing experience!!!,positive
We had an amazing time with Brittany and James! They made the entire process completely worry free so that we were fully able to focus on having a great time. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get the full Las Vegas experience!,positive
"A group of friends and I visited Las Vegas last weekend, and we had a WONDERFUL experience with Strip Trips!! Our fearless leaders, Brittany and James, planned everything out and made everything we did hassle-free. We walked down Fremont Street, acted like kids and played games, went to the most exclusive bars and clubs in numerous different casinos/hotels, had a cabana at a pool party, took so many priceless photos, met new friends, and rode in an OPEN-BAR party limo and bus almost EVERYWHERE we went! People say you can't see all of Vegas in one weekend, but we made it happen! This is the best option if you are having a bachelor/bachelorette or birthday party! It is also great if you just want to have an amazing time without the stress of planning everything. If you book with Strip Trips in advance, almost everything is included so you don't have to worry about spending a ton of money the weekend of the trip. I felt like a VIP at every single place we went! We were on the list at every bar/club/pool party, which means we got to skip the line and walk right in (free). The people in line seemed to be very jealous of our connections ;-) This weekend was definitely one for the books! Party buses, dance offs, clubs, pool parties, gambling, exclusive (off the menu) drinks, chandeliers, beautiful sights, new friends, laughing until it hurt, dune buggies, and SO much more! I recommend Strip Trips to anyone and everyone. Thank you, Brittany and James, for this unforgettable experience.",positive
We went there for my best friends bachelor party and had an amazing time! Brittany and James were very friendly and took care of us!! I highly recommend it but the only thing i didn't like was that we were told we had all you can drink top shelf liquor which was not completely true...they are mixed drinks. We will be back and thanks a lot again!!!,positive
"The most EPIC Vegas trip of all time! I never want to do Vegas any other way.!!! I went last minute with my buddies for a birthday party/going away party- best decision I ever made. This company does it all and goes above n beyond to make sure every guest has an amazing Vegas experience. Kick ass nightclubs, sick pool party, awesome hosts and everything runs like clockwork. I can't recommend them enough!",positive
"I LITERALLY LOVE STRIP TRIPS. Anyone doing strip trips are winners and if you don't use them you're a square. Basically Amy is amazing, they take you to bars and games. It's amazing seriously.",positive
"The strip is pretty interesting. There always tourist walking around and taking pictures. They have a lot of hotels and shops. Some of the restaurants on the strip can be pricey. Some people can be drunk and say rude things, because they let you drink alcohol on the strip. People that dress up in costumes usually ask for money when you take a picture with them. I came here in the summer and winter and I can say winter is the better weather to go. Because the summer is very hot.",positive
"Britanny approached me on my Graduation day, asked me if I wanted to join the Vegas Trip Graduation Party. I gave it a shot and she asked me to join the raffle coz I might get it for free. I did, and the next day I got an email saying I won the said raffle!! I tagged my boyfriend along and got the package for him for a reduced price. Overall, the trip was awesome!! We went club and bar hopping for the weekend! The party bus was great! Amy, Brittany and James were very great hosts! Our favorite part of the trip was the pool party! We had fast passes for club entrances, which was great. I highly recommend booking a trip with them if you want to spend your weekend in Vegas like a VIP.",positive
"If you are going to Vegas, you need to use strip trips. Brittany, James and Amy are incredible human beings and go over and beyond to make your trip incredibly memorable. We really wanted to see a huge specific headliner DJ and they were somehow able to pull strings and get us in instead of the original club on the itinerary. We couldn't be more pleased. This is an affordable way to go to Vegas and you get to experience things you wouldn't necessarily wouldn't even think you could do in Vegas. We are happy to know that we've made new friends with the Brittany, James and Amy and plan on meeting up in our home towns! Super successful rad trip!!! Thanks again you three!! chelsea vesely",positive
"Vegas trip planning right here! Check them out and you wont regret it. They will get you deals for small groups, individuals, or even custom large group trips. With tons of contacts in the Vegas scene they get the job done and ensure you will have a great time! From just a short fun filled day or so to a whole weekend of fun festivities they are sure to line out a perfect trip for you!",positive
"This tour was amazing, it was organized right down to every minute. It was the perfect balance between group activities and free time. The guide was full of local knowledge, it was a blast! Would definitely recommend for any new or frequent Vegas traveller :)",positive
We booked this tour for a girls weekend away and it was fantastic. It was affordable and alot of fun. Our guide went the extra mile to make sure we were always having a great time. We stayed at the Flamingo which is located in the middle of the strip. Overall great weekend.,positive
I deeply appreciated all the work that was put into planning our past Vegas trip for my friends bachelorette party. Very detailed and we'll put together to make sure our girls trip was filled with never ending fun! My absolute favorite part were the club entries & complimentary drinks! I plan on doing this again when I plan my future wedding!,positive
I highly recommend Las Vegas Strip Trips to plan your next Vegas vacation! Our itinerary was flexible enough to allow us to make changes if we wanted to stay somewhere longer but full enough that we always had something fun to do. Exactly what was needed to make our vacation enjoyable and fun!,positive
"Beyond amazing experience !!! Very well planned out and It couldn't have gone better . Great price, and layout of events. The entrances to the clubs was my favorite part, we got right in with comp drinks! I highly recommend to anyone with a large group on a budget !",positive
"Brittany helped me plan my sisters bachelorette party. It was amazing. Everything was so detailed! There was two itineraries one for me and one for the guests. It had step by step in what to do, how long things would take, and what to expect. She called me to check in a few times to make sure things were going good. She gave us options and kept it within our budget...It was so much fun. Definitely stress free weekend. She got us into the coolest restaurants and clubs. It was the best time I had in Vegas! The girls were so impressed, it definitely made me look good lol Strongly recommend this company if you want to have fun and not worry about a thing!",positive
This was my 1st experience with a group planed trip to vegas. I do have to say that it the trip was well organized and put together. Brittany was our guide and she us a weekend for the memory book. I look forward to Brittany planning my next Vegas weekend.,positive
"Organized, well planned, & affordable... That's how I'd summarize the management of this last trip to LV Strip. This is my second trip through Strip Trips and I am already looking forward to signing up for another one in the new year...!!",positive
"Went to the August, 2014 Vegas trip and absolutely loved every bit of it! Brittany is so professional and was on top of everything during the trip - always updating us and giving us many options of what we could do while we were there. When I go on vacation, I like to relax and not stress out about where to go, what time, who's coming, etc.... Strip Trips did all this and more, and definitely made it easy for me to enjoy the company of great friends that turned into lasting memories. I will absolutely be going on the next trip!!",positive
"There are several boat tours of Montreal, but this one happen to be included with the Montreal Passeport. Otherwise this will set you back $25, in which its more of a 3 Star experience. With any 60 minute boat tour, you're not going to go far. But you do get some nice views of Montreal from the river. Old Montreal is lovely from the river. You'll also see the futuristic Habitat 67 housing complex, the Biosphere, the old Molson brewery, Le Ronde theme park and more. The narration ain't bad, nor are the drink prices. With so much good food available in Montreal, I'd skip the mediocore looking food. Unfortunately there are not a lot of open air seats. If its a nice day, get there early to claim a good seat. Otherwise you're seeing Montreal behind foggy glass, which there is no point, though suppose this is good for rainy days.",positive
I really enjoyed the 4 course dinner cruise on the St. Lawrence. The waitstaff and crew were kind and attentive and attended my every need. The light show at the end of the cruise was awesome.,positive
"On my recent visit to Montreal, I met up with an old high school friend and his awesome family. I hadn't seen him in approximately 33 years! We had reconnected on Facebook, and we had a lovely day together in Old Montreal. One of the highlighs of the day was taking this 90 minute tour along the St. Laurent River. Even though we're both native Montrealers, we both learned some new things about our city and we all had a marvelous time! The day was sweltering hot, so this cruise was a welcome respite from the heat. (The downstairs is enclosed and air conditioned, but we opted to sit on the upper deck. There's a nice breeze when the boat is moving and it felt SO good and was so relaxing). Our tour guide was hysterical! He made a few jokes that we literally laughed for a while about - and referenced later in the evening! Too funny! We passed under the Jacques Cartier Bridge, passed by the roller coaster at La Ronde, the Biodome, the Molson brewery and more, learning little nuggets of Montreal history along the way. We all had drinks and some refreshing sherbet, too. This was a very enjoyable and informative cruise. I recommended it to my folks who live in the city and they plan on checking it out.",positive
"Our Passeport came with an hour boat ride along the St. Lawrence River. If you're tired of walking in the heat, jump on a boat cruise and enjoy the scenery. We didn't buy any food but they do serve beverages on the tour. Our guide was very friendly and made the cruise enjoyable.",positive
This was a great way to see some of the sites along the water and to relax. Really fun trip. We did the 1.5 hr trip and it was well worth it! Everyone was really nice. Sitting outside was the best! Easy to make reservations online as well as buy tickets at boat!,positive
"We booked reservations on Le Bateau Mouche with the expectation that we would ""tour"" Montreal have a lovely dinner, etc. Well, I learned nothing of Montreal as it wasn't really a tour. The dinner was horrible from beginning to end. Fried cheese was served cold and soggy, the salad had soggy croutons and a piece of bread with melted gouda that was cold, and the main course...well...awful! The temperature on the boat was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I had been looking forward to the cruise for over a month and was completely disappointed with how lacking the entire event was. I couldn't wait to get off the boat...and when I did, we ran to the nearest restaurant because we were starving! Don't waste your money on this!",negative
J'ai eu une tour brunch avec une amie .La nourriture √©tait diversifi√©e et tr√®s bonne. La dur√©e √©tait de 2 heures environs . Je vais faire au courant la croisi√®re au alentour du fleure Saint -Laurent .On m'a dit que √ßa vaut la peine le faire . Tant pour L'ambiance que pour la nourriture,positive
"Nous avions r√©serv√© la partie sup√©rieure du bateau (aussi appel√© salon VIP) pour le 60e anniversaire de mariage de mes grand-parents. En tout 20 personnes. Le service fut absolument incroyable. Les employ√©s et membres d'√©quipages √©taient tr√®s courtois et de service. Un souper en 5 services avec du choix pour tous. A noter : aucune option v√©g√©tarienne. Nourriture assez bonne et l√©g√®re. Ap√©ritif, Vin rouge ou blanc avec le souper, Cidre de pomme ou porto avec le fromage. Dessert ultra d√©licieux ! ( petit pot de brownies avec dulce de leche et meringue) La terrasse ext√©rieure ( r√©serv√©e aux gens du salon VIP ) offre une vue imprenable durant tout le long du trajet et permet de sortir prendre l'air entre les services. A recommencer un jour, le prix du billet est dispendieux mais je crois que √ßa vaut la peine pour un anniversaire !! (+- 100$)",positive
"My in-laws came up to Montreal for a week, and we were looking for things to do, and stumbled upon this cruise when strolling through the old port. They offer 60 and 90 minute rides. I asked about the difference, and the 60 minute cruise goes the same locations as the 90 minute cruise, but the 90 minute cruise is simply a slower pace and is offered around lunch time, suggesting you should take this cruise if you were interested in eating lunch. The 60 minute cruise was $24, and the 90 minute was $28 per person. The boat ride is very smooth, and the tour guide really does a good job keeping the tourists engaged. Drinks are expensive, we ran up almost a $100 tab in an hour, with only taking 2 alcoholic drinks each for 4 people and an order of chips. They also offer a day cruise to Quebec City, with overnight stay in Quebec City and cruise back the next day. I plan on giving this one a shot.",positive
"I booked half the boat for a large group. Tickets were easy to book in advance, and we were able to book either the whole rooftop outside deck with ample notice, or half the group inside and half outside. Depending on the weather, the upper deck may be wonderfully sunny with little shady areas or a bit too cool with the wind. Food and drink service is offered, but a bit too expensive for my tastes. The guided tour of the water is a perfect afternoon activity to learn more about Habitat 67, Montreal history and offered in french and english. HIghly recommended if the weather is nice and you've got an afternoon to spend in the lovely parts of Old Montreal.",positive
"PROS: has refrigerator and microwave, free parking, free breakfast, free WiFi. Has a kitchen. Yes, not a lot of hotels around the area has all these amenities. Water pressure in shower was pretty good. Housekeeping was hospitable. CONS: we were unable to cook since they charge for rental of pots/pans. Free breakfast must be eaten in breakfast area, no food allowed in room. Towels are counted so make sure you don't lose any or accidentally take one or some home or you will get an invoice. I know because there's a sign on the corner of the bathroom mirror. Don't try to get coffee in the lobby, it's not free. You need your credit card in order to get coffee lol. This place is gonna nickel and dime you LMAO. Whoever runs this place is a very FRUGAL person. Please give your customers the OPTION to rent pots/pans for FREE and then take the money out of their deposits if they break them or come up missing instead of charging them additional to rent lol.",negative
"My husband and I stayed here for 10 days and it was so memorable. It was my husbands first time in Toronto and we found this hotel online. Booking our room was easy and the rooms available were great! We booked the ""one bedroom"" room with a living area+TV and washer dryer +a full kitchen. This type of room was perfect for our long stay. The hotel was extremely beautiful and so modern looking. It is honestly the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Clean. Clean and did I mention it is clean? Our hotel room was spotless- which is very important to me. I was so happy by the cleanliness of our room that I was so incredibly comfortable the whole time. The hotel is a high rise so we had the most incredible view of the city- it was amazing. The hotel served a hot breakfast buffet to their guest. Eggs, toast, sausage, fresh fruit, juice, hot tea & coffee, etc. they served it in their check in lobby which overlooked the beautiful city- great views all around. The hotel was very central- Centerpoint mall was walking distance- we were close to so many delicious restaurants. Also we were not very far from the subway station (which was a great way to get downtown Toronto). We are so thankful to the staff because they were very accommodating and customer service was excellent!! The washer/dryer came in very handy- with all of the traveling all over the city and to Niagara Falls, we definitely used it! So very happy with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it!!!",positive
"Solid hotel, especially if you don't mind staying a little further away from downtown. Free parking, free wifi and free breakfast for around $100 USD a night (via Hotwire) seems like a good deal. If you plan on hanging around downtown, then the location may be less than ideal. It's about a 5 minute drive to the nearest TTC subway station (Yonge & FInch) and a good 30 minute drive from the downtown core. However if you're just visiting family/friends in the suburbs than this is a good option. There are tons of good Persian and Korean restaurants close by and even a grocery store in the building. The rooms are basic, but clean and modern with a kitchenette, balcony and plentiful closet space. Not the friendliest service (breakfast and check-in staff), but at least our room was cleaned efficiently and in a timely manner. My girlfriend forgot her toothbrush and unfortunately the hotel ""did not receive [their] shipment."" Also the parking and elevators can be confusing at first. Despite of these minor inconveniences, I would still return. I think Liberty Suites offers a comfortable and economical lodging option in the GTA.",negative
Stayed here a few times and it was great. The room is quite spacious especially just for two people. So it's definitely accommodating for families. The staff at the front desk are friendly. The views we had from our room were pretty nice. The only complaint I have is the TV's brightness is not the greatest. Even if you try adjusting it nothing works. And if you want to watch tv from your bed it's difficult to watch because of the distance.,positive
"I will not recommend this place!!!! Again, it's my second night here and still air conditioning was not working after informing the front desk. The rate was good and nice place but comfort ability to relax was the worst ever.",negative
The rating is actually 4.5 stars. The parking issue subtracts a 1/2 star for being really confusing. There is an attached parking garage that's difficult to locate the entrance to and confusing to navigate once inside. However the parking issue did not take away from the experience. The rooms are all suites that are large and clean. They all have amazing views of the city of Toronto although being on the 21st floor probably added to the ambiance. They all come with nice sized televisions and fully functional kitchens. The rooms are very minimalist and elegant. The staff was friendly. We only paid 89.00 per night which is a steal for such a nice place. Overall a great find and we will be back soon.,positive
"Although I live right by this intersection, I've stayed here twice whenever I needed a staycation. This hotel is affordable, clean, and modern, however, I did have one very negative experience that I will share first before going into all the positives of this hotel. The first time I stayed here, the fridge made a constant humming sound all night. And it wasn't a quiet, soothing sound. It was loud and very annoying. Then in the morning (8 or 9am), the fire alarm woke me up! For the next hour and a half, it was the beeps of the fire alarm followed by an automated message saying ""there is a fire in the parking garage"". After 20 or 30 minutes, I heard the fire trucks arrive and they didn't leave for another 30 minutes - meanwhile, the alarm and automated message kept repeating itself. The second time I stayed here, I found an old fudgesicle in the fridge. Although it was very funny, I think the hotel should have cleaned the kitchen area a little more thoroughly. Despite these incidents, I would still recommend staying here! In terms of location, this hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the Yonge and Steeles intersection, so very easy to get to by bus or car. There's underground parking - I believe you get to park 1 or 2 cars for free (you need to get a parking pass from the front desk), and then any other cars you would have to pay for. There's a grocery store, mini mall (very sad mall - basically only office space and some food shops), and a plaza with a few restaurants and offices. I recommend checking out Muncheez if you're staying here! Since this is also a residential building, you have to take the elevators up to the floor 12 to get to the front desk. There, they offer you tea, coffee, and water, and there's a beautiful view of North York. From floor 12, you take the elevators to your floor. They offer free wifi and free breakfast (unfortunately I slept through breakfast twice). The rooms are newly renovated and very spacious! Each room comes with a kitchen and even plates and utensils. However, the TVs in each room are very small! There's couches and a coffee table in front of the TV, but it doesn't help when you want to watch TV from bed.",positive
"I hate giving bad reviews and only do it when I feel the people have a right to know certain facts before spending their money. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases. The hotel building is nice. The management, not so good!!! They micromanage everything but not in a good way. For example: - They have removed the handles from all the windows so windows can't be opened at all. When asked, they said, they won't give them because it is their policy. So if you like some fresh air, you are not in luck. - The huge kitchens have not so much as a plastic knife to cut an apple. There is just a sign that says if you want dishes, you have to pay. When I brought that up at the check out, the unapologetic response was that I could have asked for dishes and only pot and pans cost money. I told them that the note on the kitchen did not specify that, but the management's response was ""You could have asked!"" - The parking lot is a insane maze with few signs which sometimes point to the wrong directions. It took us 15 minutes to find where the hotel parking is at 2:00 a.m. Again, management's response was that there is nothing they can do about it. You get the picture. In addition, They made multiple mistakes in reservations and billing. They also charge 3% destination fee which they insisted everyone does, but I certainly have never paid before. When asked further, I was told that it included the free parking and the breakfast. Well, I don't think they should call it free then! As nice as the building was, I did not feel welcomed and was relieved when we moved to Hilton half way through our vacation.",negative
"Love this hotel, been here a few times now! It's super clean, and the area is pretty good. They have friendly front desk staff, which is a plus. Also, you get free wifi, parking and breakfast with your stay! However 4 stars, only because the parking area to the lobby can be a drag.. Especially if your bringing a lot of items. Also, if you need something (i.e. toothbrush/toothpaste, plates, etc.) you need to go all the way down to the lobby to get those items.",positive
"I have stayed here several times now, simply because the location is great! The rooms are very nice and with a modern feel to them, they are comfortable and relaxing like a hotel room should be. I do believe I will be staying here may more times. The rooms are very modern in design and feel with all the modern accessories; like the laps near the bed you can connect your phone with the electrical outlet or the USB outlet, and there is a Krieg coffee maker. Plus the bed are super comfortable, they have your typical white sheets, soft pillows, which gives you a great sleep. Now the building it self does not offer any amenities like a pool or a gym, but I guess you can always fill up your bath tub or work out on the stairs up and down 50 time :) Lastly the breakfast has certainly improved from the first time I stayed here, it has turn form a continental to a buffet style. Very tasty and filling. I recommend this hotel to any travel for any reason.",positive
"Really enjoyed my stay at Liberty Suites! Stayed here during my short visit to Toronto. The view from my hotel room was amazing! Our room was very comfortable and the room is very modern and new. It provides a home feeling. Our room also had a full kitchen as well. Only wish they provided some plates and utensils to use! Came down one morning for the complimentary breakfast. Lots of people and didn't have much food. They have underground garage which is very nice. The are located right next to an asian supermarket and a mall, which is very convenient. The location of the hotel is very good as well. Will definitely stay here again the next time I visit Toronto.",positive
Well..... Other reviewers were completely right about this hotel. Nice rooms but always some shortcomings. 1. The hotel room needs to have a desk even if it has a kitchen (sorta) 2. If there is a kitchen one one assume that you need some utensils and dishes irrespective of the situation. 3. Breakfast doesn't stop at 9:30 am. I don't if this is because there is an intent to for the guests to avail themselves of the mall services but meetings may not start at 9 am sharp. Overall I think it's an OK place for a hotel even though I think it was intended more as a short term stay for business people.,negative
"An excellent value in Toronto! High end feel without the high end price. Every room is a suite. The pros- super clean and affordable rooms/suites. Friendly staff. Comortable bed with plenty of pilllows. Far enough away from the downtown insanity but close enough to get there when you want to. Abundant free parking. Free breakfast with both hot and cold options. Cons- parking is free but the garage can be difficult to navigate. You must park on level P2. Breakfast is good but limited (it's free so i didn't have any real issue, just passing along info). No on site laundry though they do offer a service for a fee which I didn't try. Important to note that the check in and reception area is on the 12th floor. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend that you do as well. Really felt like I had my own little place in Toronto during my visit from 9/23 Thu 9/30/15.",positive
"Without going into a long story about our experience, here's what you need to know. -Pros - The price was great - The rooms are nice and modern with a nice kitchen -Cons -They have a full kitchen with NO UTENSILS,PLATES,CUPS...NOTHING - Parking is confusing and complicated with no thought in mind of the customer - The staff including management is beyond rude and if you need ANYTHING (pillows, towels, blankets) they tell you to come down to the lobby and get it yourself - They assigned our room to another couple, so of course as I stepped out of the shower my wife screamed because a guy tapped his card and walked into our room with his wife. My wife said ""Wait, Wait!"" The management staff could care less when we. Complained. - Gym is awful. No real equipment - They're breakfast is a joke, nothing but sweet carbs. Inadequate seating Don't waste your time",negative
"Really really nice and fantastic for the price. The location is not prime, of course, but it's a great hotel with a nice kitchenette in all the rooms with brand new appliances. The staff was very friendly and the halls are actually quite quiet with the exception of one 5 minute bout of rowdy kids in the hall around 10 PM. But considering the hotel was full that was the only noise heard in the hotel throughout my stay. The tv is a bit slow, but it's a great room to cook a nice meal for yourself with foods bought from the market in the same complex.",positive
"Summary of the review: overall it's a nice hotel and has good potential. It's just very new and unsettled. Good things: free parking, free breakfast, free wifi, full kitchen (with oven), modern faucets, nice plates and cups (nothing fancy, just nice), big refrigerator, nice view from high level floors Opportunities: service does not meet hospitality standards, kitchen does not have basic things like towels/pans/dishwasher soap/..., there was no work area (in my suite = studio) Experience: we arrived there shortly past noon - nice underground parking, interesting elevators. The lobby is on 12th floor. When asked if we can check-in earlier, we got a cold ""NO"" with an explanation that check-in is at 3pm. I knew that! and that was not my question! The other hotels usually do not care to let customers to check in earlier unless a specific room type is not ready, but here she didn't even bother to check. Luckily, it was lunch time, so we spent couple of hours on lunch and shopping. Check in at 3pm was fast and smooth. We got everything that we needed. Around 7pm I called the front desk. Waited at least 3 min until someone answered. Usually, help desks at other hotels answer immediately and then ask you to stay on hold if they are extremely busy ;/. I gave 3 stars, just because the hotel has potential. Otherwise, it would be 2 stars maximum. I hope all of these small and irritating things will be resolved with time and it's going to be a nice place to stay.",negative
"My wife and I travel to Madison on the University's dime several times a year. This time we were put up at the Lowell Center. Yes, the rooms are reminiscent of a dorm room. Our room was perfect for one person and adequate for two. The location is perfect, close to State Street and the University. The room was warm when we checked in. Due to some reviews referring to the lack of climate controls, I was surprised to find a thermostat. Set it to 70 degrees and went out for supper. The room was a perfect temperature when we returned. The room (601) was quiet; and the bed was most comfortable. The room included a coffee maker, an ironing board and a refrigerator. Breakfast is served on the lowest floor; and it was really good. There was a young lady who cooked your eggs how you want them. There was fresh fruit and a waffle station, and a couple of juice choices. My wife said the coffee was good (she is a bit of a coffee snob); and they had a great assortment of tea (yes, I'm a tea snob). For once the tea drinkers get their due! All in all a very nice breakfast set up. We were lucky enough to score a spot in their limited parking lot right behind the hotel. Just two suggestions...They might want to find another vender for their shampoos and body lotion. They were so full of perfume scent that it stuck with you for days. They were so strong smelling, I would call it a stench. Ditch the gas station toilet paper...'nuf said. Modestly priced, clean, great location, good breakfast, comfortable room, and screaming fast WiFi. Not to mention a very friendly and helpful staff, made our stay a genuine pleasure. Definitely, we would gladly stay here again.",positive
"I book this hotel for collegues visiting Madison for business. It's so affordable, it almost scared me. But we have stayed at this hotel multiple times and come away with consistent, pleasant comments. The hotel is quite comfortable and the customer service is simply amazing! Highly recommend~",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised with the Lowell Center. We stayed at Lowell during Spring Parents week. Lowell is in a great location, close to University, activities, lakefront and State St. Very affordable. We did opt in for parking so we did not have to worry about meters. Word to the wise, the parking lot is a couple blocks away. Our room was immaculate, modern and organized. Not a large room but not small either. Linens were quality. Room was quiet. TV was functional with cable. Loved the in room Keurig. Bathroom was big, lots of towels, Bath and Body Works lotions, soaps and shampoos. Takes a minute or two for hot water to get up to the sixth floor, but it will get there. Ironing board was hiding in the closet. Lowell has other mentionable amenities. The pool is large and clean. There are computers in the lobby if you need one. So happy to find some much needed afternoon coffee in the lobby right when I needed it. The breakfast buffet was ample; better than a Holiday Inn. Cereals, yogurts, cut fruit, bananas, apples, waffle makers, bagels, toasters, sausages, eggs to order, coffee, juices, teas and probably some other stuff too. Would for sure stay here again.",positive
"Pleasant 3-night stay. I was in town for university business and this was a great location and value. Nice staff, comfy rooms, and one of the best complimentary breakfasts I have seen. There is also a nice big pool. Highly recommended.",positive
"This is a really nice affordable place, very clean and close to State street, the Memorial Union and the lake. It was small but we had two queen beds. There is a Frat house next door and across the street but we never heard a peep out of them. Parking lot is small. I didn't check out breakfast or the pool but wish I had.",positive
"Pros: location on campus, historical photographs, pool/sauna, eggbake at breakfast, pleasant/attentive breakfast service. Cons: bedbugs in deluxe room, NO hot water for entire building for approx 16 hours(I should have checked out at this point, my mistake),missed room service, rude brunette at front desk-during check out I went to contest my bill since it differed from my emailed confirmation. Maybe the reservation code provided wasn't utilized. She refused to look at the email that I had up on my phone and bluntly told me that any code provided are not promo codes but allows me to be a guest at the Lowell. Definitely didn't feel like I was being treated as a guest more like a second class citizen. Advise: have a back-up plan if hot water fails. Doesn't sound like this is an isolated problem.",negative
"About 3 1/2 stars. For a hotel, the deluxe room was about the size of a dorm room, twin bed and desk. Standing shower only, and smaller than normal toiletries. They do have a keurig in the room, if you like coffee. Would be good to bring your own cups if you use one at home and have a preference on what you drink. Tiny fridge in room, but big enough if just yourself. Pluses: edge of campus, so it's close to conference center, close to downtown shopping and plenty of restaurants on or close to state street. The morning breakfast buffet, though small (see a theme?), was good. Standard bagels/bread, doughnuts, waffle maker, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, and a daily protein they make. Really liked the chorizo egg scramble one day. Parking lot is small and tight. The convenience though may bring me back.",positive
"This hotel is a little known gem! I stayed at the hotel for badger game day and had such a wonderful time. Immediately when you walk into the lobby you know the hotel is quality. There is a high en business center with apple computers and printers. The rooms are clean and the bed is very comfortable. There is even a keurig coffee maker in each room! The continental breakfast is amazing, eggs made to order, waffle station, sausage and an assortment of bagels and donuts. I am definitely staying here every time I come to Madison.",positive
"Great hotel! I thought it was going to be a dorm with shared bathrooms, etc but it is NOT that! IT IS A REGULAR HOTEL! I was in a regular hotel room with my own bathroom. I was there last month -- April 2014. PROS: On campus. Walking distance to State Street where there are plenty of restaurants (potbellys, etc.), Walgreens, clothing stores, etc. Buffet breakfast. Absolutely the BEST waffles. You pour the batter into the waffle iron and three minutes later, you get fresh, crisp, tasty waffles. You can add strawberries, syrup, whipped cream, etc. I have never tasted better waffles. Fridge in room. Small but a good convenience. Near the lake. Pretty view of the lake. Close to Dane County airport (MSN). About a 20-minute cab ride. CONS: On campus lol. You will see tons of college kids if you venture out late at night. Buffet breakfast lol. It is not a large buffet. The egg station is just....scrambled eggs. Not omlets, just scrambled eggs. They should at least offer the option of adding cheese but I did not see that. I did get egg white only scrambled eggs so ....... Hard to regulate temperature in room. Heater is operated separately from air conditioner. Air conditioner is a stand alone air cirulator look alike. Toiletries are small. They provide lotion, conditioner, and shampoo in VERY small bottles. Bring your own or ask for extra - you'll need it. Overall, I liked it and I would stay there again.",positive
"The Lowell Center is great for business travelers. I have been there multiple times to discuss research programs and the Lowell Center gives a good environment for business while still allowing for comforts of home after hours. All of the rooms are reasonably sized and well furnished, although it's very similar to every dorm room I've ever been in.The service is very good and the breakfast in the morning is absolutely amazing. I definitely appreciate the ability to walk to a lot of restaurants in town.",positive
"I have been staying here for campus visits for many years now and even stayed here for a few weeks a few summers ago, and the rooms have improved. Most have had the bathrooms modernized, new TVs installed, and the wifi is much better. The weekly breakfasts are awesome - the famous Lowell Center egg bake is a winner and the pool is a nice bonus. It is walking distance to the Historical Society, the main campus, and the memorial union. It is also close to state street and a walk to the capitol will take just a few minutes and you can check out the many coffee shops and cafes on State Street. What is not so great? Breakfast: Saturday and Sunday the egg bake is out the door as the food service workers have the weekend off and work-study kids take over. On the weekends expect sausage links, bagels (which were pretty good) and bagged hard boiled eggs. For some reason only the food service workers can make the egg bakes - and the students can't. Now, no one would think to have the egg bakes made then frozen or - egads- have a food service worker work each day of the weekend. It is just silly if you ask me that they have one breakfast M-F and a totally different experience S-Sun. Give us the Lowell Center egg bake! Coffee: Let us have coffee beyond the rather Spartan ""regular"" breakfast hours. A few pots on the first floor would go a long way to make guests feel like guests. Parking: I don't remember paying extra for parking a few years ago, but now in order to park for free you must park several blocks away. Seems like a hassle. Greek Life: The frat boys and sorority girls are walking up and down this street making noise all the time. The new mid-rise apartments across the street are very loud. My friends and I saw girls flashing tops and bottoms the night we were there. We were not complaining, but it was a bit loud, and a bit much. Of course, the Lowell Center does not have any control over the drunk boys and girls on the patio showing their short-shorts or lifting up skirts.",negative
"Nice no thrills place, great updated rooms. Breakfast fair is typical of any ""continental"" offering no worse no better. Dig the locaion to State St and the Capitol.",positive
"Lowell Center is right off campus and is only open to those with a U of Wis connection. I'ts a great place both for location and price. I checked out hotels - all of which were farther away from campus and more expensive. It's at least as nice as a decent mid-priced hotel and with washing machines and a decent breakfast included, quite a deal when you're trying to stay at decent places without breaking the bank over a 10 day period. And clean!! We lucked out and got a lake view - absolutely wonderful.",positive
"The room, yet quaint, is very updated. Bed is very comfy, room is very clean. Great location; in walking distance to tons of stuff. Great guest service at the front desk also. Highly reccommend!",positive
"awesome spot for $80, incredibly clean, perfect location, nice bath products, good service. i'd stay there again, fo sho!",positive
"The Lyft driver called and he was in the wrong place. When the car arrived, after nearly 30 minutes, the driver did not match the picture sent. The driver said it wasn't a current picture, but assured me it was him. The driver was a young Asian man. The picture was an older middle eastern man. Lyft wanted to charge us $30 for our ride. Once I cancelled the drive with the wrong driver, Lyft charged me $5. The taxi ride to our location was $9.25. This was my first Lyft drive ever. Needless to say, that app is hitting the trash.",negative
Well I have found their service rather excellent recently ; henceforth I just wanted to upgrade my review . Oh but future ventures have yet to figure out anything different . Hopefully nothing shall change .,positive
Called for a ride after I had some materials dropped off at a FEDEX office in downtown and need to head to the airport. My driver arrived in a reasonable amount of time and got me to the airport on time. He was friendly and professional and I have no complaints what so ever. Thank you.,positive
"Had a very pleasant experience with Lyft over the weekend. The driver was pleasant, prompt and efficient and she found my destination without any problems. I will definitely use Lyft again, in fact every time I'm in Pittsburgh, PA.",positive
"I have used Lyft and Uber for the exact same trip many times, and Lyft is always more expensive than Uber. For some reason, Lyft drivers like to take me on a route that is twice as long. Nonetheless, I like the personality of the drivers better, and I feel slightly safer with them. They have also never picked me up late or driven me to my destination late. Their cars are always clean. I like that I can charge a tip to my credit card on the app rather than have to use cash. I will continue to use them each week.",positive
"When: Sunday, June 19th, 2016 Party of 3 This was my first time in Pittsburgh and using the Lyft service. We were pleasantly surprised how accurate and easy to use the Lyft App was. We could track the vehicle as it arrived at our hotel, Homewood Suites Robinson Mall on GSK Drive. We were headed to Station Square in Downtown Pittsburgh for a Brewery Tour. Our driver was Aryn, who was friendly and personable. Her vehicle was a clean Honda Civic. For the 14+ mile trip, our fare came to $22.20, before tip & Lyft credit. Our driver on the return trip back to the hotel was Avery, who drove a nice Ford Fusion. He was quiet, but drove in a very safe manner. Our return fare, came out to $20.20, before tip & Lyft credit. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience using the Lyft service for the very first time. We will definitely recommend it to others when in Pittsburgh and we will definitely use this service when visiting other cities.",positive
"Have to say that I never used Lyft or Uber until this past weekend in Pittsburgh and I was seriously wowed. Lyft's service was polite and friendly. Cars were more than prompt and the drivers couldn't have been nicer. The second time I was in a building complex and couldn't locate the car. Used to app to reach the driver and 2 minutes later, there he was. App was easy, intuitive and very effective, as well. Surprisingly, price was substantially lower than I expected even during a surge period prior to Carnegie Mellon's graduation. Honestly, I would have gladly paid a lot more. Better for the drivers, I guess since I gave them both large and, I might add, well deserved tips. Really great service. 5 enthusiastic stars.",positive
"Lyft is the worst company on the planet. If you even think about doing business with them or accepting a ride from one of their criminal, murderous, low-life ""drivers"" you must be insane or suicidal. There is a reason UBER exists and it's to put fly-by-night criminal organizations like this out of business. Do yourself a favor and stay the fuck away from Lyft. They will fuck you up and ruin your life.",negative
"Tariq was our driver on a Friday afternoon, coming from the airport to the Omni William Penn. Quite a bit of traffic but he handled it well. He told us about the area, recommended places to go, things to do, etc. Very gracious and jovial!",positive
We had Tariq as our driver. He was awesome and friendly and filled is in on some facts about the city on our 45 minute drive to the hotel! We will use lyft again to get back to the airport tomorrow!,positive
"I had a great experience with Lyft. My dog was sick and needed to go to the vet today. My ride couldn't come at such short notice so I downloaded the app and requested a Lyft. My driver, Shelley was here in 3-5 minutes. I went outside to see if she accepted dogs (I didn't know any other way to ask via app) Luckily she did and we were on our way to the vet! My dog is extremely happy and friendly. Shelley didn't mind the kisses from my pup. A few minutes later we were at our destination. My first ride was free and I asked Shelley what all I had to do. She said Lyft suggests we rate the driver and they also rate the passenger. Shelley, my pup and I all had 5 star days. I asked about tipping from the app and she said the app let's you tip on there. I received a text saying I get $15 in credits so that's great news! Great service and I'm thankful they accepted my dog!! :) I do want to note that it's not accessible everywhere. I've tried Lyft a few times from Bobbys phone and the app said Lyft only offers rides in city limits. One request was at South Hills Village mall and the other request was for a ride from McKnight road Target which isn't too far. I was confused about McKnight road not being considered city limits. However, my ride today worked out well and that's what this review is about.",positive
"I've been using them for over a year and live the service!!! You never wait more than 15 minutes and they don't complain about short trips. In pittsburgh, it's the best option.",positive
"Always quality, prompt service. Always super friendly. You don't get any weirdos like with Uber. It's always the most affordable. $7 from Oakland to Southside and a $5 tip (because these people are super nice and I want to keep Lyft in Pittsburgh.) Also in the app at the top there's a slider that you can toggle over to ""Plus"" if you have a group of 6+.",positive
"I've used Lyft three times now, all within the past month. Not owning a car in PGH, there are some neighborhoods that can be difficult to access, despite that I have a free bus pass and a bike. Also, there are some times that I just want to get somewhere quickly without the hassle of waiting for a bus or cycling over. Lyft has proven to be an excellent resource in those cases, providing me with a great transportation alternative. The first time I used Lyft, I used it to get to a friend's house in the Wilkinsburg/Edgewood area. Since that was my first time, I took advantage of the code on Yelp offering a free ride up to $25 (see above). The second time, I used it to get to the Wigle Whiskey Barrelhouse in the Spring Hill neighborhood of the North Side (near Penn Brewery). The third time, I used it to get to a restaurant on Bryant Street in Highland Park. All three times, the rides took about 10 min. and cost $8. Each time, a driver came within 10 min. of summoning them. Two out of three of the drivers were very friendly and conversational--the third tried, but didn't talk as much and conversation seemed somewhat awkward and forced when he did. None of them offered any water, snacks, etc., but then again, I don't really expect this--I'm just looking for a quick and economical ride to wherever I'm going with some friendly banter. Overall, I've had a great experience using Lyft, but I do have a couple of minor criticisms. The first is the range of service, which encompasses the city limits and the suburbs west of the city out to the airport. It would be great if the range could be extended to encompass some of the suburbs in other directions. The second is the lack of a meter--or even an estimate when the destination is entered. While fares are very reasonable and have been the same for all of my rides, it would be great to know about how much I'll be expected to pay prior to the end of the ride. Despite these criticisms, I am awarding a 5 star rating because Lyft has been significantly better and more reliable than PGH's other ground transportation alternatives (and no, I've never used Yellow Cab). For PGH, Lyft really is as good as it gets when it comes to getting from Point A to Point B in a vehicle that I don't own and don't have to drive in an efficient and cost-effective manner.",positive
"Awesome concept, great drivers, and they show up! With snacks, and water bottles and such. Love love love this service!!!",positive
"Lyft has changed my life. I am a professional Vocal coach who runs her own private studio from home. The challenge for me is I have a learning disability that prevents me from being able to drive. Pittsburgh Cab services have done nothing but cost me money, heart ache, and often put me in dangerous situations. This winter, Lyft changed all that for me. I could go where I wanted, I never had to bribe or barter, and above everything else: as a Young Woman who often travels alone. I felt safe. You can't put a price tag on that. Believe me. I am so shocked that Jitneys, cars without back seats, and things of that nature are not something Pittsburgh wants to take off the streets. I am heart broken that the City is trying to take this gem away from us. To stop people from getting home after work late at night, and traveling and vagabonding in my opinion is a crime. I'm just holding my breath that the Mayor the fine people of people of Pittsburgh PA who are the Drivers of the excellent company win this battle. If not, I'll be stranded again. And so will so many more.",positive
"I definitely enjoyed using Lyft. We parked our car in Bloomfield and walked down the hill to attend Art All Night in Lville. At 1am or so we left and didn't feel like walking back so we requested a ride with the Lyft app. The driver arrived in maybe 3 minutes. He was friendly and chatted with us a bit. One thing to note: At this time of night apparently there weren't many drivers, as we were alerted by the app that an automatic 50% gratuity was being added to our fare to encourage more drivers to drive. Even with that, our ride was only $10 which was fine with me for such prompt service. I do worry a bit for the drivers when it comes to reported issues with auto insurance and whatnot...I can only hope that Lyft treats its drivers well and covers issues like that appropriately.",positive
"Note: I'm posting a review for this San Francisco-based company since they operate in around 60 different cities, including Pittsburgh, and I want people in this city to know about Lyft. In recent months, you may have seen cars zipping happily about Pittsburgh with pink,fuzzy moustaches mounted in between the front headlights. Do not fear them. Yellow Cab, however, should and is reacting accordingly... http://www.post-gazette.com/business/2014/04/26/PUC-cracks-down-on-Lyft-Uber-drivers/stories/201404250181 Unlike other cab services, Lyft cannot be reached by phone. Rather, interested commuters need to download the Lyft app to their smartphones and register through Facebook. Once your credit card information and phone number are set up (Lyft is completely cashless), all you have to do to request a ride is tap the icon, enter your location along with your destination, and wait. Soon, you'll see thumbnail pictures of your driver and his or her car along with their name. Once you order a ride, you'll even be able to track your driver's route to you. I tried Lyft a couple of Saturdays ago when no-car me needed to be shuttled to Bloomfield for a concert. My wait was 10 minutes each way. I was greeted both times by a friendly driver who fistbumped me and insist that I sit up front, offering me water, candy, and snacks. Get this: My trips both to and from Bloomfield cost me nothing since I was a new customer, therefore making me eligible for a ""Pioneer"" discount good for 2 free rides. My fare and tip were both factored in. Gratuities are automatically calculated into your total and are charged to your card. If there are no drivers available at the moment, the app will notify you. You will also be notified when your ride is near. Once you have arrived at your destination, you will be asked to rate your driver (drivers with an average rating less than a 4.5 are eliminated from Lyft). Other Things People Should Know About Lyft 1. Their fares are generally less than other cab companies in the metro area(roughly by 30%). My trip to Bloomfield cost about $9. 2. A ""prime-time"" ride (say around 2am on a Friday or Saturday night) will result in a 75% gratuity fee, but even with that factored in, my ride home was around $20. 3. Your initial ""Pioneer"" rides are good for rides $25 and under. 4. Drivers undergo extensive checks regarding their criminal and driving records. Cars must be 2000 models at the oldest and are thoroughly inspected. Only 6% of drivers who apply are hired. 5. Your total fee includes the cost per mile, the cost per minute, a pickup fee, and a ""trust and safety"" fee. The minimum charge is $4, and there is a $5 cancellation fee. 6. So far, Lyft only covers the city of Pittsburgh and some suburbs, mainly the Western ones. http://www.lyft.com/help?article=1408415 Lyft is your buddy with wheels, and when you're stranded, give 'em a call, 24/7. Sign up this instant! P.S. Lyft Pittsburgh doesn't appear to have a physical address. Again, the corporate headquarters is in San Francisco.",positive
"I'm giving them 1 star for their poor customer service. Stayed here March 31 to April 2nd. My husband checked in on March 31st and I didn't arrive until April 1st. We had a two queen bed, room 7305. Room was fairly spacious. When I arrived on Sunday, I immediately showered, got ready and gone to the pool party (Daylight Beach Club) all day and didn't get back in the room until about 8pm. I never left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door because I wanted housekeeping to clean the room and replace the towels. Our room was never serviced/cleaned. Trash was not taken out nor towels replaced. Beds were not made as well. I called guest services and the lady I spoke with said to me that ""we were busy today and we weren't able to get to your room"". Not a bit apologetic. She offered to have towels bring up to our room but thats not the point. I wanted to come back to a clean room, bed made, etc. Isn't housekeeping part of our room services that we paid for? Maybe Mandalay needs to hire more staff. It's unacceptable to use the excuse ""we're too busy to get to your room"". We won't be coming back into this hotel and would not recommend to anyone.",negative
"Mandalay Bay: A very nice hotel but VERY greedy- Here are my complaints..... 1st- They do not disclose to you that in order to use the lazy river with a tube, you have to purchase a cabana for a min $175 fee for complimentary tubes- OR purchase a $5 tube for $25....we spent $100 for 4 tubes. Not to mention, we had two blem tubes that we had to take back and swap with good tubes and the gal at the front reiterated with us that they are selling bad tubes- so, Mandalay Bay knows their tubes are cheap yet charges $25/tube. 2nd- Alcohol is ridiculously expensive. I.e- $75 for a small bottle of vodka or $10 for a domestic beer. 3rd- They charge for parking ON TOP of the insane price to stay at the hotel- $15/night. 4th- They came in to clean our room- instead of vacuuming and replacing our towels, they checked the mini bar and immediately charged us for the drinks we used. So, we came back to our room with a $75 charge and no fresh towels. 5th- When you book your hotel, they don't tell you that per day, they are charging you a 13.39% room tax, ""resort fee"" and a resort fee tax- PER DAY! By the time we checked out, in the three nights and two days that we stayed at Mandalay Bay, we were charged AN ADDITIONAL, over $300 just in tax ON TOP of the over $800 we already paid to stay just two days. Lastly- They charge $5/each for in room coffee that YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOURSELF Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel but VERY GREEDY. They like to nickel and dime you between undisclosed taxes and fees, to $25 tubes and expensive alcohol. Make sure you're not on a budget when you book a stay at Mandalay Bay because when you check out, you will have a surprise list of fees awaiting you Very sneaky!!!",negative
"We got a a pretty good deal on the room. However, check in and check out was a hassle! There was quite a long line to check in and the restaurant and shops are really not that great in the hotel. I checked out via Mobil and provided my email to get a receipt but one was not sent. I then had to call guest services and stay on hold for quite some time since we had already left the hotel. The representative Rosie then sent me the incorrect receipt. I had to then call back and the representative, James, explained to me that the email feature was not yet programmed into the mobile checkout even though it appears as on option. As I am getting noticeably frustrated he proceeds to tell me that there were mini bar charges since things were move around but that he credited back to the account. He proceeded to attempt to talk over me and respond with quite an attitude, very poor customer service. If he was in my shoes he would not be a happy camper about the checkout process so he should be more understanding. Honestly, given the recent events I don't it's worth saving money on this hotel. I am leaving with such a bad impression of this pace. It would be better to spend more on quality customer service, better restaurants, and a peace of mind.",negative
"This hotel is beautiful! Wonderful, friendly staff...definitely a big thumbs up on service! Our room was clean, beautiful views, comfortable beds - BUT! I can hear my next door neighbors...It wasn't any babbling through the walls, but a clear understanding of their conversations...It was late, and we didn't want the television on, but, now that I think about it, it would have been a good idea. The walls MUST be thin...definitely not acoustically well insulated...Don't dare of think of doing any hanky panky here, or even inviting a few friends over in the evenings...For me that would be a No-NO! We were also trying to keep our 4 year old from being too noisy. Where's my free coffee? No free coffee?? To use their prepacked coffee cups is $5!! I'm so utterly disappointed. Normally these are the freebies! OK, nagging put aside...I have to say, I enjoyed the shoppes linking the Mandalay Bay to the Luxor. I bought me some shoes, and my hubby had the privilege of meeting Pete Rose in the Art of Music store. For that alone, he loves his place. The other BIG PLUS was the hotel's great pools, spas, sandy beach/wave pool AND the lazy river!!! There is no inner tube rental...They are only provided if you chose to rent a $350 per day cabana...The other option, which we did, was purchase the inner tubes from the surf shop - $18 for the small, $22 for the large...I thought they were cool, so I purchased one... I really appreciated the non-peak season atmosphere...it was wonderful! I had to give this place only 3-stars because I could not get over the thin walls....Sheez, I had to be on my best behavior! Imagine that!!",negative
Scary beyond scary bedbugs and bedbugs. Uncleanliness beyond. Rude people beyond rude. Dirty room and bedroom staff rude and disgusting,negative
To say I am disappointed is an understatement. We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday and had to wait 1.5 hours in a line to check in with my 2 and 4 year old. They never apologized about the wait or offered a free drink etc. - We then got our rooms and one was cleaned and one was not. The one that was cleaned was supposed to be two queen beds and it wasn't ... So once again we had an issue and had to move rooms. The room was decent.... It had a strange sewer smell when we used the bathtub which was gross. The room service was ridiculously over priced... $25 for a small pizza- plus a $10 service fee. We fed our 4 little kids two pizzas and fries for $75!!!! Seriously?? The rest of the stay was ok! We have been to many hotels and it has never been this much of a hassle and negative. Never staying here again.,negative
"Money was taken by hotel staff while my roommates and I were at an event. The only people that have a key besides my roommates and I are hotel staff. Housekeeping was on my floor cleaning between the hours of 1pm-3pm.Money was taken from my wallet that was in my purse. My purse was in a closed closet on the top shelf. Hotel security was called and the Hotel manager was called and I my incident was treated like it was no big deal. The Hotel manager seemed very dismissive and his attitude towards me screamed ""It's not my problem"". He offered no help and no solution. I'm from New York and now I'm in Las Vegas with no funds for the remainder of my trip. I will NEVER frequent this establishment EVER AGAIN!",negative
"My favorite hotel on the strip so far. Beautiful rooms, big tubs, the casino smells like coconuts. It gets docked a star because its at the ass end of the strip and the location of the food court doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",positive
"I'm a fan and frequent guest of the many properties under the MGM Resorts International umbrella so imagine my surprise when I realized that 1: I had never stayed at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and 2: I've never set foot in the hotel in all the years I've been going to Las Vegas. So it was only natural that on this Vegas trip I made it a point to make a reservation to stay here. I booked a 2 bedroom panoramic suite and arrived on a Friday. The check in process was fairly easy. All desks were open and helping guests so even though there was a long line I was checked in and headed to my room in less than 15 minutes. The room! My gosh the room is fantastic! The suite my family and I stayed in was on the 12th floor and as the name of the room implies it has two bedrooms. One bedroom has one king bed and the other room (the bigger of the two rooms) has two queen beds. Each room has its own bathroom. The room with the king bed has a tub, two sinks and a shower while the other room had two sinks and a shower stall. The shared living area was huge! Two flat screen TV's, two separate sitting areas. One side had a couch and the other had a table and four very comfortable chairs. There is also a table that separates the room and sits up to five The room also boasts fantastic views of the pool and Las Vegas Strip. There is also a mini wet bar and snacks that offers alcohol and snacks for a fee. Now on to the rest of the property: The casino floor seemed smaller than most other casinos on the Strip and a quick lap around the entire floor took less than 10-15 minutes. They have all the new slot machines and some of the old favorites. The table games are the same as in every other casino and the dealers and every employee on the casino floor that I encountered were friendly, courteous and were very helpful. There are several restaurants on the property and they range from fast food to elegant dining. The buffet was really good. I had the dinner service and Sunday brunch. Overall my stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino exceeded my expectations and then some. The property is clean, the employees are friendly and the food and beverage selection is impeccable. The cornerstone of my visit though had to be the room. It was fantastic but then again, MGM Resorts International always brings it. Stay here. You won't be disappointed. Till Next Yelp!",positive
"They charge for daily parking, late check out fee of $40 when I only extend from 11-1, and bottle openers. No complimentary water. Oh, housekeeping also broke my expensive hairdryer. Not happy with this stay.",negative
"What else can I say... It's Mandalay Bay! First time here and yes it's Vegas, everything is over priced and the rooms are amazing! You pay for what you get. We stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the strip, worth the extra $$ to get the view! Favorite restaurant was Citizens...you have to buy (off the menu, not take out) the turkey club on cranberry bread. The best sandwich I have ever had! Stay away from Starbucks...for 2 of us to eat breakfast there we spent $48.00. Yikes! What a rip off. Also sucks that they charge for parking now. Best advice if driving is to park first, bring your parking receipt to the front desk upon check in and give it to them. You can use your room key for entering and exiting the parking. $10 to self park per day and $19 for valet. Enjoy Vegas!",positive
"Wow! MB just started charging for parking. Who does that in Vegas?! - evidently someone who DOESN'T want you to stop by shop, eat, or gamble when you have tons of other choices. Bad move for B-list casino. Agree with prior review that the garage is a maze. Lots of traffic back up getting into the garage - prepare to wait. Card readers having problems paying on the way out as well.",negative
Had a wonderful two night stay here at Mandalay Bay. The updated rooms were very clean and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable with clean bright white sheets and bedding. I especially liked the open layout of the bathroom. All the staff members on the casino floor as well as restaurants we encountered were all very friendly. I come to Las Vegas very frequently and this is one of my favorite hotels especially in the summertime when the pools are open.,positive
"So glad they did some upgrades here, a lot better than before . One big thing is they've closed off the window that looks into the bathroom in the rooms - not sure who thought that was a good idea in the first place! Front desk staff have always been super helpful,friendly and efficient. We've never had any problems staying here. Housekeeping are friendly and do a great job too. Lots of food places here and it's handy having Light nightclub here right downstairs. There is also lots of self parking available too. We loved the keyhole mirrors on each level ...Came in useful for our Halloween costumes this year - White Rabbit and the Queen of Hearts!",positive
"We stayed at this hotel August 14th to the 16th. On the morning of our checkout around 7-8 am while we were all sleeping, my friend woke up to a man standing in our room. He ran out the door when he realized she was awake and she followed him and saw that he used a towel to keep the door open so it would not make any noise. She told us after what had happened, but we were all confused and thought it was a mistake by one of the employees of Mandalay bay. As we were packing we realized that my boyfriends iPhone and money from my friends purse was missing and searched the whole room and found nothing. That is when we knew for sure that the man my friend saw came in here to steal from us because clothes were moved around and there is no other explanation we could think of. We had the two keys to the room the hotel provided for us so we know that we didn't accidentally drop one of our keys, which means it had to be an employee that had access to keys and the shirt he was wearing was worn by other employees we saw walking around. We reported the incident immediately and the hotel made us fill out a form writing down everything that happened and told us it would take 7-10 business days to investigate till they would get back to us. They also said that they could do nothing else for us even though we feel like our safety and privacy was broken. It has been over 3 weeks now and I called asking for an update which they passed me around to a bunch of numbers. The last number they transferred me to, they gave me a number in case it got disconnected. There was a problem so I called the number back that they gave me to which Verizon told me this number is not a working number.. If they looked at the security cameras in the hall way they could clearly see a man walking into our room and using a key, but I doubt they even investigated this incident. I do not care about the stolen items at this point, but I do care about the fact that they did not take us seriously or do a little more for us because having a man enter your hotel room without your consent while you are sleeping is not something you would expect from a hotel like this and no longer feel safe to ever stay at this hotel again.",negative
"This hotel is simply amazing. It has everything you need to enjoy and relax in the sin city. The staff are so accommodating, they make you feel like home. We were here at a super busy weekend (manny vs mayweather fight). But the hotel still ran smoothly. The pools was nice and lots of chairs to sit on. Loads of restaurants and shops and the sky train is a life saver. It prevents you from wasting your energy from walking to the strip. The only downfall is the room. It didn't look like the picture. Bummer. The x3 suite are old and outdated, would've love to have the exact room in the picture. :) oh well. Still had a good time. Will definitely be back and rent a room here again if the price is right.",positive
"LOVED my stay here last weekend. My boyfriend and I were in town to celebrate an anniversary and a friend's 30th birthday and I felt well taken care of at every point in our stay with them. The check-in was easy. The room was spacious, well appointed and very clean. The Mix Lounge and Mix restaurant were two of the top evening highlights of my trip (great views!!). The pools were wonderful and the cabana and lounge chair staff were amazing. We went to the Planet Hollywood pool one of the days to meet up with our friends and I instantly wished I was back at Mandalay Bay for the impeccable customer service. Never had a bad meal, and never had a bad customer service experience. Special shout out to concierge Joshua Worthy who helped me on multiple days of our stay and always remembered our last conversation even after speaking with what I'm sure was hundreds of other people. Will definitely be staying here again!",positive
"The resort property, casino & shops are wonderful. Being a local I usually avoid the strip unless I have guests or are seeing a show. Last night it was the latter. We decided to eat at Hussongs Cantina then saw the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show. In between we walked around, shopped, gambled and listen to some great music in the lounge. The casino is roomy and fun and you didn't die of thirst waiting for a cocktail waitress. Great friendly service from everyone.",positive
Oh my god. The valet actually lost our car and key. I'm sure this happens but they took such slow action to suggest a reimbursement for a taxi. I know they handle a lot of cars but they just need to have some better organizational system. Suggestion if you valet take a picture of your plate or car and note the valet that handled it. It's been about an hour waiting for them to find it. Definitely not happy campers.,negative
"If I were rating on customer service this place would have a 1. The men and women working at the concierge desk were by far the rudest I have ever encountered in my travels. The woman who checked us in barely spoke English and kept getting frustrated with us because we couldn't understand her. They refused to help us find a show to see and had no dinner suggestions for us. They charged my card twice and could not have cared less. The issue was corrected, but it put a damper on our trip for sure. I'm going with a 3, because aside from the customer service our room was really nice. The location worked out perfect for us. We could easily walk to Excalibur, New York New York, MGM, and others. The only transportation we used was a cab to and from the airport. It also connected to a mall, which was convenient.",negative
I stayed at the mandalay for two nights and came for the Michael Jackson world tour. The hotel room is huge and the bathroom is five star. Shop at bottom of stairs has everything you need 24/7 eg booze free USA today paper water and sandwiches. Spa is best best and free with manicure or any other service . The women's spa has soaking tub and cold plunge and beautiful relaxing area. Cardio room is free. Checking in was easy. I flew in on virgin America ( the most amazing and different cultured airline I've ever been on - am looking forward to flying with them again) - from san Francisco and with two nights at the mandalay was only $300 plus bag fee of $20. Pretty good deal. Shuttle to airport RT is twelve bucks. Am definitely coming back. Very low maintenance and relaxing trip.,positive
"CON CON CON CON! If I could give them zero stars I would. I stayed there about 2 weeks ago with my girlfriend to go party and have a good time. Well from the moment we walked in to waiting 25 minutes to check in, not having our room type available, being downgraded, giving us an occupied room, coming back downstairs, waiting another 25 more minutes. They were neither apologetic nor accommodating. They offered to comp one night... which keep in mind we were paying more than $340 a night for serivce with an ""F"" you attitude. They were not able to comp the first night since we booked thru hotwire, too many red tape blah blah blah. So they offered us a $200.00 f&b credit. The restaurants suck at the hotel and are so hard to find. The restaurants were not showing the credit and so we had to call and straighten that out. They did offer to give us 4 access passes to their spa facilites but unfortunately the spa was only showing 1. The service, food, rooms suck. I will NEVER stay there nor would I ever recommend it. That's what we get for staying there when we could have stayed at the Wynn.",negative
"Mandalay Bay is a great hotel for relaxation, spa, and the pool area. Stayed in on the suites, nice and spacious with all the amenities a suite should have. Rum Jungle downstairs was a pretty good place to eat at too.",positive
"First off.... THE BEACH is incredible. I almost felt like I was back in California with the tropical Milieu sections of pools. The wave pool and lazy river were popular areas, but I was partial to one of the stagnant bodies of water where the setting was a little more calm, perfect for someone wanting to nurse a hangover. :) The room was a delight as well. I'm a fan of beds that resemble that of cloud-like sensation. Our view over looking the strip was fun to watch sunrise and sunset, the atmosphere all around the hotel was that of mid-twenties and above, so it was great to not feel like you were in a constant frat house.... just a more ""adult"" setting for crazy drunken chaos.... ha ha ha. Overall, I recommend this hotel to those who like to have a comfortable, sheik setting with a thick top coating of your ""Vegas"" adventures.",positive
"*BEAUTIFUL!!!* I stayed here for my Honeymoon back in September '06. I reserved the Honeymoon suite but when I got there, all the honeymoon suites were booked. They automatically upgraded me to the 765 sq ft Deluxe king suite that was a $200 more per day at no cost. This room was beautiful, large living room area with two chairs and a large sofa-bed. The Bed was a very comfortable king. And the bathroom, that was huge. Large jacuzzi tub, huge vanity area with a gigantic mirror, large closet, and a separate toilet room. Which help a lot after eating at all the buffets and restaurants. I stayed here for 4 days and I still didn't have enough time to see all the amenities and attractions that are on the property. I was able to visit the Beach and the lagoon. They both were VERY nice and reminded me of a beach resort. The Bayside Buffet was delicious and very nice. I also tried Trattoria Del Lupo by Wolfgang Puck, it was good but not great. Last but not least, Rumjungle is an awesome nightclub. I love this place and I would stay here again if I could afford it. Highly recommended.",positive
"This used to be my home in Vegas.... whenever we went to vegas... this is where we stayed... it got to be second nature kinda... you know how these casinos are crazy big and it takes a couple days of wandering around sometimes to really figure out where everything is in relation to everything else? Well... I had Mandalay Bay kinda figured out. Yes... the restaurants there were on the pricey side... but it was rare that I actually ate at them anyway... The statue outside of the russian place.... the cool triangular chargers, the good bowls of noodles, the polite staff at the buffet... and hanging out at the west valet side and spotting the working women strolling in. I had a couple different rooms at this place... first time was a full 1 bed corner suite, then I was there for a pseudo bachelor party and got the full 2 bed corner suite... then I actually had to pay for it myself, and got a regular room. The pool and the endless river thing were cool to hang out at. wow... it's been a while.. maybe I should go back...good memories here.",positive
"I absolutely loved my experience here and I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for an above-average-yet-still-affordable place in Vegas. Between the TV in the bathroom so you can watch March Madness basketball games from the tub, the spectacular view of the strip, the ENORMOUS sports book with tons of seating and a cafe inside of it, the shark reef, the no-cover lounge/dance club in the middle of the casino and the friendly cocktail waitresses, you don't even have to LEAVE the Mandalay. Rooms: OK I do agree with another reviewer who says the soundproofing is terrible. Well, I sort of feel bad for the people next to us because with 17 drunk people in our room playing flip cup (what are we, in a frat?) and blasting music (they have these cool iPod dock speakers), we were probably the noisy neighbors. So watch out for this if you are planning a romantic weekend. If not, you should stay here if you want a party suite because the rooms are very spacious. The beds were unbelievable, the view was so so so spectacular (be sure to book a view room) and the bathroom was really luxurious. Service: Everyone from the bellhop who suggested that I bring my case of water into the hotel when he saw that he had to transport 37 gallons of vodka up to my room, to the woman who took off an incorrect charge on the room bill, were all extremely friendly. Customer service is one thing Vegas has down pat. That and taking your money for it. ;-) Sports book: One of the reasons I chose Mandalay. They have, hands-down, the BEST sports book in Vegas. I was shocked when I saw others were so shitty (i.e. NY NY, MGM). Mandalay Bay has literally like 60 stories of TVs and ample seating. You can always get a seat and a waitress. The spreads were also better here than other casinos. Clubs/Bars: The Eye Candy lounge was great. HUGE flat-screens to watch the games and a ton of seating you don't have to pay for. They make this awesome drink called an Antioxidant -- with fresh berries too. Bit of a girly drink, but if you get it as a shooter is still actually surprisingly refreshing and then your friends won't make fun of you. The Mix has an awesome view, great photo op but not so great music. It's OK though, because I got to witness my friend try to make out with another friend in a storage closet and get caught by security and kicked out. There's also a guy standing outside the clubs with passes and if you tip him $20 he'll get your whole group in for $10 a head rather than $25. Worth it if you're in a big group. Not so worth it to pay $25 cover for a club that plays crappy techno mashed with Journey. But if you're a guest, you only pay $10 cover anyway. Buffet: The Bayside Buffet is good for dinner but just OK for lunch (they have pretty much the same menu but no fresh seafood at lunch). $26 for dinner on a weekend is pretty good for Vegas I think, comparable to other places. Prime rib, steaks, fresh crab legs, shrimp cocktail, pizza, a pasta bar, soups, fresh salads... all pretty common buffet fare. Their dessert bar was humongous too. But I think I've been to better buffets. Pool: Jesus, I did a lot at the Mandalay. Their pool area is AWESOME, but just beware that it's really crowded. If you go by yourself you can find a lounge-chair and drag it anywhere you want, but if you're in a group, good luck finding a spot for more than 3 people. The wave pool is fun, but their hot tubs are EEEEEEEEETY BITTY LIVING SPACES (gold star for anyone who can name that reference). No more than 5 people at a time. What else? Oh the tram connects you to Luxor or straight to Excalibur, and from there you can get to MGM or New York New York pretty easily. We basically didn't leave that one corner of Vegas the entire weekend and I didn't really mind. Tip: I booked my stay through www.travelzoo.com, for 20% off. They continuously have deals for Vegas hotels/shows.",positive
"The wifey and I stayed there for 4 nights. The rooms were spacious, front desk staff was helpful and . The pool the bomb. If you like to people watch, go there. The price was OK since we stayed there during the week. I would stay there again.",positive
"I love the hotel at Mandalay Bay (the separate, newer boutique tower). Our suite was sizable an very tastefully decorated. The spa at the hotel (Bathhouse) is my favorite on the strip. As for the casino itself, I'm not a fan. I had the worst sushi of my life at a restaurant inside the casino. However, the poker room is FULL of fish and it's always half blinds. Mandalay Bay, where fish play! I simply cannot get enough.",positive
"this hotel is A-W-E-S-O-M-E! i think we got a regular room but the size was like a suite! it's at the end of the strip but you can play in this ginormous hotel all day long. you'd never know it but the places goes on for miles and miles (it's a good hike to the convention center)! we totally enjoyed all the restaurants, entertainment, their luxurious spa and all the wonderful service we received. sad to say, we ran out of time and couldn't enjoy the beach simulated pool. another good reason to go back! =)",positive
Can't say too much because we were in and out? Very clean. Well Light. Very directional. Took a long time getting baggage but that doesn't reflect on the Airport.,positive
Nothing here is gluten free and shouldn't every restaurant or food vendor have gluten free now. It's 2018 now and how are people with allergies supposed to eat?,negative
Sandra olson in pickup was just plain out of line. She started her conversation by yelling at me. I'm a adult here lower ur voice 5 levels so I can understand what ur problem is. She definitely needs customer service classes. I dont respond well to a person yelling at me because they dont like the way I am walking. Talk to me like you have some sense and we will get somewhere.,negative
"Very simple to find my way around and to my gate with all the signs they have. I love that there's plentiful of food restaurants and restrooms around, also super clean! Decent WiFi and well organized with the taxis outsized. The only thing I struggled was find where uber and lyfts pick you up, that could've been on my part since i wasn't looking at signs. I didn't have any major trouble with this airport and perhaps I will be returning to Las Vegas in the future!",positive
"One of my favorite airports because it offers so many food options, decent wifi, tons of shops. The place is huge and terminal 1 to terminal 3 is not walking distance. Just an fyi",positive
"Nothing spectacular for new arrivals. They do have slot machines, but saw nobody winning while I was waiting for my plane. Was told by an older slot player long ago to stay away from them. I would give a suggestion that they have better signage to where parking, or pick up from ride shares. Very confusing if you arrive late. Departure went smooth and fast",negative
I like this airport just for the simple fact that there are slot machines all over the place and it gives you classic Vegas as soon as you get off of the plane. I've been multiple times to this airport and it never gets old. Good selection of restaurants too.,positive
"This is one of my favorite airports in the world. The shopping is fabulous, there are tons of restaurants and snack shops and you can play slot machines while waiting for your flight! The airport is clean and well laid out for such a large airport. They have quick busses to the rental car center and taxis organized just outside of the baggage claim. If you have never been to Vegas you need to visit before you die as their isn't any place in the world like it. Enjoy!",positive
Very poor and in adequate signage to direct people to the rental car location via shuttlebus several of the folks on our bus as well as ourselves at difficulty finding the location they can do a much better job if they choose,negative
"My only complaint about this airport is the tsa staff are rude and not very patient. Granted it was 5 in the morning when we were there, but there was no reason to snap at people and roll eyes. Definitely on a power trip. We overhead numerous people on the tram to the gate that they've never seen such rude staff before. Other then that, the airport is fine. Flight was on time and the airport is easy to get around. At least I'm prepared for next time. I'll remember it's ok to be a bitch at the airport because it'll help me fit right in.",negative
"Really loud, I mean loud !!!! announcements, keep repeating over and over !! So stupid ! Not really a world class airport, nor is D gates user friendly.",negative
Walk a quarter mile to find a dirty bathroom. Inside newer terminals it looks like a suburban strip mall swap meet. Dirty and tacky. Concourse is an obstacle course of everything you don't w by or need.,negative
"Not a lot to say except small airport, and is clean, and well maintenanced. Most staff was informed and helpful but we did run into a couple that were oblivious to what was going on and we had to ask more than one person the same question. Lockers are available free of charge to leave your belongings and bathrooms are clean and well maintained.",positive
"Ample shopping and restaurants. Healthy options as well. Starbucks, CPK, Chilis and fast food available. Make sure you get on the right tram or you'll go to C gates. Slots in Terminal if you didn't get enough action in the casino. Great bagel shop near top of escalators. Bathrooms always need attention - trash bins full and floors dirty (men's). The only significant negative which pulls the rating down from 4 stars to 3.",negative
"I like this airport and remember back when it was much smaller, how the times change. Of course it is huge now much like other major hubs. And I do enjoy visiting Las Vegas. Especially I enjoy the year round weather there.",positive
"I had a shoulder massage with Hope, and it was the best decision I made all weekend. Hope gave me the refresh I needed after a few days of late nights and early mornings. I had my chair massage in Terminal C. If you're in the airport with time to spare, this is the cheapest and most worthwhile thing you can do for yourself.",positive
"As you come out of the airport terminal 1 D, you'll see a couple rows of slot machines then heading back to the check in area are shops restaurants and restroom: Slot machines - between the D gates Walk toward the check in area -- Center of hallway Starbucks - nearest the D gates Left Chili's Hudson News Welcome to LV store Right Red Mango Metro Pizza Restrooms Center of hallway Quiznos Sub - farthest from the D gates Flies to/from this gate: Hawaiian Air - right of D gate area Delta - left and far gate area of D gate It's nice, mildly air conditioned (it's August 2017), the floors are shiny and clean, chairs are leather looking and a cluster of them at each gate. There are TV monitors above the seating areas. There's a Rolex clock on the left facing the end of the terminal in the casino area just where the gate seating begins. Trash and recycle bins are at the walkway area just outside each gate seating area. Huge windows give you views of the airport and this Nevada, LV area. Not too loud. There are charging stations on the right, Hawaiian Air side. Loud speakers kinda loud enough to hear the boarding callls and not miss your flight. Restrooms are clean and have lots of stalls but the doors open inward so it's a tight squeeze with not much room for you and your carry on to get in and out easily.

"It's a little confusing because the name had been changed from Microtel to Baymont. It's still under the same parent company so I guess the management is still the same. Anyway, I go to vegas with my wife and my dog. We don't want to bother people to dogsit so we just bring him and leave him in the hotel room when we go out and about since he's trained well. So our hotel choices are limited to the pet-friendly ones. We used to stay at the Westin Casuarina just a few steps off the strip but they usually charge well over $100/night even if it's already a deal. With a little bit more research, we found Microtel (or Baymont) which had pretty good reviews from some travel websites from those in a similar situation than us, people with pets. So we gave it a try. We've stayed here twice now, both times we paid well below $100/night. The first time I checked-in was a little bit of a struggle because we had booked our reservations for a jacuzzi suite from Expedia and nothing in neither the hotel's website nor in Expedia says that dogs are not allowed in jacuzzi suites. So when I got to check-in, they wouldn't let us have the suite. They wanted to downgrade us to just a regular room, not even a regular suite. So I fought it a little bit and they eventually put us in a compromise of a regular suite rather than just a room. I just wished that this policy is disclosed somewhere clearly in their website. The suite is just right in size. Their bed is not quite the Heavenly Bed they have at the Westin Casuarina but it's not bad. The hotel is small but that's a positive for me. Less people who look at you weird when they see you take your dog out to do his thing, unlike in the bigger hotel - Westin. It's also clean. The front desk can be a little bit more friendly but ehh, I really don't care. They have free breakfast, which was good at first but after having the same waffles, cereals, sausage and eggs in the morning, you get pretty sick of it. The amenities were lacking in the fitness part. They have a pool and a fitness room. When I went to the fitness room hoping to get some reps done, dumbbells are nowhere to be found. My master bathroom is probably bigger than their fitness room. All they had was a treadmill that doesn't work, an elliptical, and some pedal that you run with your hands instead of your legs. Good thing there's a 24-hr Fitness gym not too far away. As far as pet amenities go, they have plastic poop bags which is a real plus but there's no grass so you'd have to make your dog do his thing on rocks. The main reason I liked this hotel, and was actually not aware and was very pleasantly surprised to find out when I did, was that it's literally right across the Las Vegas Premium Outlets South. You really just have to cross the small street separating them and you're there at the outlets. It's also very close to food places in the same plaza as the outlets, close to a 7-Eleven, and a CVS pharmacy for those late night needs. Did I say it's about a mile away from Bachi Burger? Yup, just a mile away. The only downside is that it's a little far off of the strip. But that doesn't really bother me. It's about a short 5-10 min drive depending on traffic. It's actually close by the South Point Hotel if you're craving for some cheap roulette game. Don't get confused now between Microtel and Baymont. They are the same. If you're still in doubt, check the address. 55 E. Robindale Road. My $0.02.",positive
"When i found out I was being sent to Vegas for an in-service, I Yelped the approved hotel options and found Microtel. So glad I did! Microtel was perfect. Check-in was easy and painless, and the folks working the front desk were always extremely helpful with questions, getting cabs, and meeting any room needs. The amenities are quaint - small pool and an even smaller gym. But enough to get by for a work trip. The location is quite far from the Strip (at least compared to what I'm used to), about a $20 cab ride. The shuttle will take you to Mandalay Bay, I think (found this out on my last day). The room itself was great. For the price paid (~$60/night), the room was superb - very clean, simple, decorated with a modern flair, and packed with everything you need. One last aspect that made my stay at Microtel amazing: the complementary continental breakfast. Coffee, tea, milk, and an assortment of juices. A variety of baked goods and cereals offered daily, and a selection of hot entrees: bacon one day, sausage the next. Eggs. Potatoes. Oatmeal. Grits. And a waffle maker! If you're on a budget, this is great - load up on a big breakfast, and take some baked goods to go and you could be set for the day! Great deal!",positive
"I found Microtel through booking on Hotwire.com where you don't know the name of the hotel until you pay. I was initially wary, because, well, I kinda think the name is bad and makes it sound small and crappy. The reviews were good and the pictures made it look nice. I think I paid $48 / night and booked it 2 days before. I was really happy with the room. It was very clean and comfortable and we arrived during the day but had been up most of the night before so the first thing we did was take a nap, and the drapes did a great job blacking out the room. The bathroom was a decent size and clean. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We never took advantage of the free breakfast, but it looked like they had quite the spread! We used their free shuttle van three times. To and from the strip, and then to the airport. The driver was friendly and professional and came quickly when we called for pickup off the strip. They're next to restaurants and an outlet mall with a decent food court. I would most certainly stay there again.",positive
Great for the money. Simple but very clean hotel with 10 min. access to the strip if you have a car. Includes basic breakfast and free Internet access which is rare these days.,positive
"Place was great. They allowed pets and prices were good. They are close enough to the strip but far enough away to enjoy other parts of Vegas away from the tourists. The breakfast was pretty good (eggs, sausage, biscuits gravy, waffles, yogurt, cereals.....etc.) and had a nice courtyard and indoor poor. Rooms were clean and tidy.",positive
"Stayed here for a few days because my dad had training. The hotel is about three years old, so everything still looks new and smells fresh. This is a non-smoking hotel, has an indoor swimming pool open 24 hrs and a gym with a treadmill, elliptical, and another machine to work out your arms, also included is a light breakfast which has egg patty, hash browns, biscuit, gravy with sausage, waffles,pancake, muffins, coffee, and juice, and some other items. The room was clean, but the water is really slippery and it takes awhile for the soap to wash away they provide shampoo and soap. Also, offered is a free trip to the airport and Mandalay Bay. The staff is super friendly, nice, and helpful. Across the street is an outlet mall, and the town square mall is a good thirty minute walk which was not that bad esp with the right temperature, but I warn you don't try it during the summer months it will be way too hot. I'd probably stay here again if I had a rental car. Another perk of the hotel is the free wi-fi.",negative
"I would put 2.5 stars but I can't do 3 because it wasn't ""a-ok"". Pros: Very cheap.. (2 queens, fri/sat night, $110 total including taxes, etc) Easy to navigate to Not a far drive down to the strip free wifi free parking free continental breakfast friendly staff clean fridge, coffee maker, microwave in room Cons: Thinnest walls of any hotel/motel/apartment I have ever experienced in my life. Not only could you hear people talking at normal volumes unless you have the a/c or tv on but that goes to a whole other level of annoying when there is some crack head in the next room ranting ALL NIGHT LONG. I got no sleep on the 2nd night. I could hear other guests yelling ""shut the F up"" as I'm sure the guy was audible to all floors. Keep in mind this is only a 2 star hotel. I would have given it a 3 star review if I had gotten sleep on the 2nd night. If you want to do Vegas on the cheap, this is still an option.",negative
"As a dog owner, it's hard finding hotels that will let me stay with my dog. If I owned a small dog, sure, I can probably sneak the dog in but I don't think I can hide my medium sized dog. So I picked this place. This is the second pet friendly hotel I've tried in Las Vegas. Pros: 1) Plenty of parking spaces on premise. 2) Friendly staff 3) Includes continental breakfast 4) Easy access to the gas station, fast food joints, shopping, etc. You can probably walk to many. 5) They supply doggy poop bags. 6) Very clean room, though I felt it was really bad taste. Carpeting and paint on the wall look outdated and appears to be from the 70s. Mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, free wifi, and LCD in the room. Cons: 1) It's pretty noisy if you don't have the Air Conditioning running. I can hear the people upstairs walking, specially when people are active (in the morning). 2) I heard someone's dog barking continuously. Don't leave the dog unattended or if your dog suffers from separation anxiety, please train your dog! 3) Far from the Vegas action, you won't be walking to Bellagio that's for sure. 4) My room did not have ""do not disturb sign"". I had to ask for one. 5) Ran out of tissue and water flow control for the shower required hard pull to turn on the shower. 6) On my check out date, they disabled my room key so I was not able to come in from the side door. I wished they didn't do this because when I travel with my dog, I have more stuff than I can carry. (I travel with airline friendly dog crate for medium sized dog. I have to make multiple trips to my car before checking out from the hotel.) 7) I hope your dog is not finicky about where to pee and poo. You won't find well manicured lawns here. There will be some area where your dog can relieve themselves but they are covered in pottery like material. 8) The area seems safe but this hotel is surrounded by abandoned homes and lots.",negative
"Fantastic place to stay if you dont mind being away from the strip. I stayed on a weekend in November and it was only $40 a night. Very clean venue. The rooms aren't too large, but they definitely make up for it with the mirror setup. You'll really be surprised with how nice the decor is for the price. Even included new flat screen TV (believe they were 32"" in, but it's been a while since I went) The best part is definitely the free breakfast. All you can eat eggs, hashbrowns, waffles, and other things too. I would stay just for that.",positive
"Thanks for procrastination and a busy weekend (and company-imposed hotel $ budget), we were stuck booking a room at Microtel. The description on Orbitz mentioned a baby grand piano in the lobby - how bad could it be, right?? I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. The place was clean, though nowhere near fancy. The only beef I had was with the smell, characteristic of many other cheap hotel chains. Like, overdose of cleaner to get rid of whatever stinky smell the previous occupant left behind. Everyone was pleasant and the breakfast was pretty decent although they made you eat it in the lobby. And on the 2nd morning we were there, they ran out of eggs for a long time. When I told the lady who was serving the area, she took about 20 minutes to come out with more...and she came out with THREE scrambled egg patties. I mean c'mon...did they run out? These were obviously frozen and merely microwaved. Three. At peak breakfast time. There were about 20 people eating breakfast and waiting for the same thing I was. Luckily, I saw her approach and snagged one. All in all, a pretty great value. The clientele seems to consist of business people (probably constrained by the same budget we were) and young people.",positive
"At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz). Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one. But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell? It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber. Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable. Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern. Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos. They even do free breakfast until 9:30am! However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!). It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front. This makes it super mellow for getting in and out. Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery. Note: No King beds. They only do Queen Sized. Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!",positive
"Stayed here for one night before my flight the next morning. I must say, this is by far the best Microtel I have stayed in and I have probably stayed in ten or twelve different Microtel's. It is obvious that the hotel is fairly new...as other reviewers did state it is a totally non-smoking hotel, so if you are a smoker I would suggest requesting a first floor room to make going in and out a little easier. The lobby is very modernly decorated, bright, and welcoming. Beds are very comfortable and soft- the only downside is that most Microtel's (including this one) don't usually have King beds- only single and double Queen rooms and suites. LCD HDTV's are also a big plus. Free Internet and phone calls anywhere in the Lower 48 is nice to save on those cell phone minutes. Upon checking in, the front desk employee was very polite and welcoming. Since this was a Tuesday night, the rate I received was an EXCELLENT value. Breakfast was excellent with eggs, sausage, and beacon as well as muffins and fruit. There is limited seating in the breakfast area, so I would imagine this is very crowded on the weekends and when the hotel is booked. This hotel is a little off the strip, so if you are planning on seeing all the sights, you need a car or rely on public transportation. The hotel is right across from the outlet Mall, which has over 100 stores as well as numerous fast food dining options all within walking distance. If you don't want fast food, there are several restaurants in front of the outlet mall along Las Vegas Blvd. including IHOP, Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, and others. These are probably a 10 minute walk from the hotel.",positive
"Disappointing, even in this price point. Reserved because of the pet policy but ended up not taking the dogs. The check in process was the only highlight. She was helpful and friendly. Safety was on my mind here, as none of the locks were installed completely and the doors didn't seal. Noise was a major issue. Somebody beat on several doors on my hallway at 430 am for half hour, obviously trying to get people up. Even with the curtains completely closed, it was light enough to see everything in the room. It seems to be a place that has regular out of town workers, which I don't have a problem with per se, but I felt like I was the only girl in a guy's dorm. Although I ended up having no issues, I won't be back.",negative
"Well lit parking, fabulous restaurant, SHOWMARS, within walking distance. Inviting entrance way, SMOKE FREE hotel. A huge plus!!!!! Room was clean, tidy. Queen size bed a little firm for me but hey you can't have it all under this price. Really good lighting over the bed too. Laminate flooring in the room so that means no nasty carpet odor. Yes! Nice view of the parking lot. Free WiFi!!!!! One ""downside"" to this hotel. They have NO ELEVATOR for your 2nd floor stay. On the other hand they have really ""fancy"" carts. Why I chose this hotel you may wonder? I needed to stay overnight in the area AND they allow pets! Yes, two limit, which happens to be what I have. Does this place meet my requirements? Yes! Remember the more you pay for a room, the better the quality most of the time. Would I choose this hotel again if needed? You bet!!!",negative
"Stopped here because I didn't want to sleep at a rest area. Room was ok for what it was supposed to do. There were no major issues other than being given a room key to a locked door, but I won't fault the attendant. After three tries, I was able to get into a new room, take a shower, and get rest. The attendant was courteous and helpful. Room was clean and, unlike other respondents, no sounds of pleasure heard.",negative
"Small Rooms, questionable activity by other guest, work trucks broken into and no pet limit, one person had a cat that had kittens in room.",negative
Room was in decent shape. Only complaint would be the walls are a lot thinner than they were at the other motel we stayed at in Pennsylvania. I could hear the guy upstairs taking a piss clear as day and people talking either in a few rooms down or in the hall down a bit from my room. The bed was super thin so tossing and turning was a big deal.,negative
"NEVER AGAIN!!....first off the walls are paper thin! We were exhausted only to be woken up at 11:30pm with screams of pleasure. This went on for a while with their door slamming and different women taking over...seemed like prostitution. We turned on our AC and music on loud and were able to go back to sleep. The motel is under construction so beware. Coffee in the morning is served with tiny cups, no lids nor creamer! We picked this motel because we needed something for a couple of hours and didn't want to call around trying to find which motel accepted our dog ...don't waste your money!! Lady at the front desk was courteous and helpful but l wouldn't go back there! This might have been an isolated incident but there are too many motels around to take another chance!",negative
"Disappointing for a Motel 6. While the brand has largely cleaned up and improved its motels over the past few years, this Motel 6 location was in very poor shape. I stayed here twice over the past month. The first stay was okay, but even then the condition of the room was sub-par. The second stay was downright awful. I reserved a room with a fridge and microwave, but they would not give me such a room. Since I had driven 700 miles, I wasn't about to put up a fight. The beds are not very comfortable, neither is firmness (too hard) or the aging sheets and blanket. The second stay also featured a room that looked like it was falling apart with broken boards and rusty nails protruding from the walls. The women on staff were very pleasant both times, but their demeanor was about the only acceptable thing I noted in my two recent stays here.",negative
"I have stayed in other Motel 6 locations before. I understand that i's a budget motel with no amenities. But I also believed that the brand assured me that I would get a clean room. This place was disgusting. Dimly lit, dirty, broken bed. I slept in my clothes on top of the bed and didn't even take a shower. I was in and out in 6 hours. Couldn't stand the thought of being there for even 5 more minutes. Unfortunately, now that I know that there is NO quality control in the Motel 6 chain, I will have to avoid staying in any Motel 6 again.",negative
"I've stayed at many motel 6's and this particular motel 6 was the worst I've ever stayed at. Yes you shouldn't expect much for the cost of a room here but my experiences prior to this have all been great. When I sat on the toilet, I felt drops of water fall onto my back, not thinking anything of it I thought it had been a wash cloth hanging from the back of the toilet which touched my back. A second time in the restroom, again water drops touched my back, this time I turned around to see if anything was sitting on the back of the toilet and there was nothing. I look up only to see water damage on the ceiling in the bathroom (I was on the first floor) and there was water dripping from the ceiling. I had left to go out later that evening and came back to my room, only to find a cockroach sitting on the wall near the bathroom and one running across the floor by my bed. I've heard many times before of cockroach's in a hotel room, this was my first time I've ever experienced it and I am not happy. I will never book here again.",negative
"I check ed in Friday night checked out today sunday march 25 th a.m..I drove from California to Arizona for a wedding it was my husband my daughter and I we got there at around 12 at night on Friday the first thing I saw was alot of burning wholes on the blankets from cigarettes, i can smell it too the tub was dirty I was tired to tell them that night so I washed it with a towel and my shampoo that night my husband couldn't sleep he went to sleep in one bed with my 3 year old daughter and I slept on the other bed alone because I am pregnant so I noticed the next morning my husband had a rash in his back he was itchy ....we left it like that and left to the wedding came back to hotel to sleep and again he couldn't sleep he said he felt something was on him we looked around and we looked in between the mattress we found a bed bug my husband was really upset and wanted to report this but maybe they wouldnt do anything because before this i had talk to the lady in front desk if i can chage rooms because it was a smoking rooM and i am pregnant i felt dizzy with the smell and she said they didnt have nothing else and if they did they would still have to clean my room so I don't know if they just didn't want to clean my room and than clean my second room so they aired my room out .. on my way home my daughter was itching she started to bleed and she had also got bite from a bed bug so my husband told me to call back to make sure This don't happen to no one else and I did and a man answered gave me attitude and said he basically said everyone does there work here on cleaning and ect. I told him about my child s leg and I told him he maybe don't understand because he maybe don't have kids he responded ""that's why I don't travel"" he was being smart with me but I'll call inspection first thing in the morning worse place ever!!!!!!

If I could leave ZERO stars I would! Thank God there was no carpet. I could only imagine how dirty that would be. The make believe bedspread; was stained and had cigarette burns. Toilettes were bad in all but 2 of our 8 rooms we had booked by our high school. Obviously don't expect much of Motel 6 but cleanliness and safety might be nice. Our high school softball team were afraid for their lives. Their own words. Police showed up shortly to deal with what appeared to be homeless people being kicked off the premises. The lady was still on the curb in the morning. Poor thing looked like a bag of trash thrown out. Her stuff3 dogs and the man were no where to be found.,negative
This place was horrible. Cigarette burns on comforters. Rooms smelled bad. Homeless people leaving rooms in morning Credit card machine down had to pay cash. One comforter was stained. I I didn't even get what I paid for. It was that bad. Wasn't even worth the 89.00.,negative
"It gets two stars for comfortable beds, the heater worked, and a roof over our heads for a night. But other than that the service at registration was slow and they only provided 3 hand towels for 4 adults. It was sketchy af but for one night not bad.",negative
Stayed for the weekend clue less of the area around well I reserved for 2 days and keep in mind I did it with someone in Corp and still mest up everything. I mean a website can go wrong but with a person no right! Don't stay here pay the extra got the extra mile point blank!!! I did get an okay room after making a scene but it doesn't have to go like that just get it right from the beginning,negative
Used Motel 6 every once in a blue moon and one thing that doesn't change is the non smoking room which heavily smells like a smokers lounge. Room 281 is a smokers lounge and doesn't even have a trash can. Rooms that smell like a smokers lounge should at least be notified to renters a head of time that way we don't have to go back and forth trying to find a room that doesn't smell! It's over priced I must say.,negative
"No heat first night. Froze and couldn't sleep. Went to desk and was told they couldn't fix it. They had no space heater to borrow. I waited in the cold in the middle of the night and finally the clerk found some extra blankets. It took a very longtime. Asked to talk with manager several times about the problem; and manager never called back. They didn't make it right. Bath tub had hairs in it. Bathroom sink leaked but repair person fixed it quickly. However, not recommended! They only had one wash cloth for two people. They can do much better and they know it!",negative
Man this place was so nasty the dirt and bugs and hair all in plane sight... I had to leave after only 3 hours I was so repulsed I checked out and asked them to refund my card. After some argument they did refund the card THANK GOD. I had a terrible time finding a hotel suitable to have my child in the weekend I was in AZ... I ended up in the Red Roof plus. Finally was in a room that didn't make me feel like my child would catch aids from touching the floor! I'd say unless your a prostitute homeless or smoke crack you probably won't want to stay here. Spend an extra 30$ a night and get a room that you can turn the lights out in without wondering what's going to creep out of the mattress when you're asleep!!!,negative
"This is the first time I've bothered to leave a review about anything, on Yelp. I picked this hotel because it was the cheapest in the area, so I wasn't expecting a Hilton experience, or even a Holiday Inn one. When I first pulled into the parking lot, there was a police forensic van working.... Not a great first impression, but I figured whatever. Then I was asked at check-in if I wanted internet in my room, and told I could pay three dollars for basic or give for premium. I was a bit irritated, but I went with the premium (which actually brought me within $5 a night of a real hotel a few streets over). Then I spent the entire evening fighting with the internet connection. Even that wouldn't have prompted me to leave a review. Instead it's what I discovered this morning: my shower will not warm up. It's not that it won't be as hot as I like, which could be OK. It won't warm up AT ALL. I highly recommend you pick a different motel or hotel. Almost anything has to be better than this place.",negative
"I just checked in and if I wasn't so tired, I'd leave. Drive 14 hrs today to come into my room to find a dirty floor with fresh shoe prints. Also, one of my dogs found a pill on the floor and I caught him on time before he swallowed it. I pray my other dog didn't eat one. No trash can in the room either. Horrible place. Too bad I had to select one star to post.",negative
If I could I wouldn't give this motel any stars. But this hotel for three nights. When they told us we could check in at 3 PM we went to the hotel for the lady at the front desk tell us is going be another hour before we can check in.. And I wasn't the only one waiting in line they said they had somebody not show up for work .. They told me they would call me in an hour and tell me that my room is available. After an hour I called them because they never called and they told me I was going to be another hour and a half before we can get into the room. So around 6 PM at night when we were supposed to check into our hotel at 3 PM we finally got a room.. At this hotel they let you keep any type a dog and there was huge dogs there. Like American pit bulls.. Your name and it was there. The dogs just started barking at 6 AM every morning for at least 30 minutes to an hour before somebody would shut them up. And if you called the front desk and tell them what was going on they told you to walk next-door and talk to the person. What kind of hotel is this?? The customer service sucks. The people at the front desk do not want to help you. And then they're running around asking if anyone got room service because they couldn't keep track of who got room service or who didn't. I didn't even know they offer them service here cause they didn't even tell us. Spend the extra $20 and go to a nice hotel do not waste your money on this hotel.. And then strippers and jaggies walk around the whole entire area. And they do nothing about it and you know that's what's going on people are not stupid,negative
"Stayed here 3/7/2016 check out 3/8/16 Recently moved to AZ and needed a place to sleep, check in was easy however i called the front desk and asked for a late check out the night i checked in. the guy working at night said i could check out at noon. At around 11am i hear a knock at the door i answer and its house keeping i told him that i have late check out, he than leaves and comes knocking again not even a minute i told him i talked to a guy name Raul he said nobody works here by that name, i said i talked to a guy last night he than leaves and a woman house keeper starts knocking i told her im doing a late check out while she was writing on a paper. She said ok. I pack all my stuff as soon as possible threw it in my car and told the lady at the front desk she tells me its been a confusing morning or something on those lines, she asked me if i wanted my key back? I said no ill just leave, as im standing in my parking lot repacking i see the guy who kept knocking at my door, i said hey i noticed he had his ear plugs in listening to music or whatever i said hey hey he looks over i said did u talk to youre manager? I told him im very tired and that i needed to rest he than as he turns the corner while putting hes headset back in he says i see what your saying and keeps walking. Not even a sorry or nothing. Not to mention the night i checked in someone was playing loud enough music in their car maybe 3 door down and someone kept whistling that night. No rest and i had to work tonight. I did contact corp to make a complaint. I stayed in room 105 p.s i dont know who cleaned the toilet befor i checked in but the seat either had old poop splash on it or something else and i had to clean it and than spray it with lysol.",negative
"Nothing says stay here like three or more cop cars in the morning when you take your dog potty. We pulled in last night and ugh...while it was definitely better outside than mesa south location (basically a glorified crack house) it was still lacking in the i feel comfortable taking my dog outside department. We figured oh well. Lock everything, and it's just the night. Room...Yuck. I love that motel 6 had installed laminates instead of carpet. Hotel carpet Is just nasty. And laminates is so easy to clean! Si is very frustrating when a room is super dirty. There were crayon pieces on the floor, some questionable tampon looking item my dog found under the bed and was gnawing on, hair in the bathroom, and visible debris everywhere. The room smelled very smoky, and like most non smokers any hints of that smell give me issues. The ac smelled like a cigarette was just blowing stinky air in the room that made both my husband's asks myself have raw throats in the morning. His was deserved for violently open mouth snoring all night! Cigarette burns everywhere. Stains on blankets. Sketchy area..ironically next to a mini golf course, paid internet that seemed to slow down and then totally quit on me, just stay somewhere else if you can!",negative

Requested a non smoking room and we arrived at 2am, as soon as we drove up there was people (drug dealers/people getting high) hanging out in the front and all along the stairs, as we walked towards our room we can smell the stench of cigarettes!! It was even worse when we opened the door. Luckily we were able to cancel our reservation and get our money back!! Never again!!!",negative
Stayed here to go to an event in Phoenix. The area was not horrid but this Motel 6 was just this side of OK. The room said non smoking but you could tell the room had been a smoking room(funny thing was it said no smoking but there were ashtrays in the room) We got to horrible beds that sounded like crunching paper when you got in and moved around in them. The sheets felt like they were washed in straight starch. And for 2 people in a room with 2 beds there was 1 hand towel and 2 bath towels. There was a couple of long stray hairs in the tub. We only paid 55.00 for the room I think we got over-charged. Live and learn. We had a reservation at the La Quinta and it was 40.00 more...we should have paid that.,negative
"I had a horrible experience at this place. Room had fake hard wood floor with crumbs and hairs everywhere. Appeared like it hadn't ever been swept. Bathroom had long hairs next to the tub. Bed sheets and pillows had stains on them. Bed spread had cigarette burns in it. Air conditioner stopped working half way through the night. Found a plastic tearoff piece of a panty liner behind the night stand. Dead bug smashed into the wall behind door. Tweakers and really sketchy people walking around the hotel. I would advise anyone to keep going and not stay at this hotel!! I told desk clerk and she said, ""it sounds like no one even cleaned the room.""",negative
Lost my house couple of months ago been staying there when i can. Price was good till they jacked up the price for what they don't offer shampoo or conditioner. A couple of rooms i got smelled moldy ac or heater didn't work. Found bed bugs in two rooms and roaches in a couple which was sick wanted my money back but management said no. Well another night there was a fight next room had my kids complaint to management telling them my kids were frightened by it there 4 and 2 years old management decent give a damn. I got kicked out of there because of my sister and her man fighting i drove here man away when i came back to rent a room they said i couldn't. If anything rent else where but one things for sure the ladies that work day and night are great and awesome but not the head guy.,negative
"I am NOT having good luck with my cheapie motels this trip. First I get a room at the Chandler Inn, which I have successfully stayed at before, that had hairs in the bathtub, a broken bed frame, and dirty female underwear stashed in the bathroom sink cabinet, then I check into the Motel 6 in Mesa that I have stayed at previously (though years ago) and the first room they assign me to has all the lights on, totally disheveled, unmade beds, trash in the wastebaskets, etc, obviously not cleaned since the previous occupants, and the room they re-assign me to has hairs all over the hardwood floors throughout, tiny hairs in and around the sink and even a few on the sheets, though they do look washed. You should not put hardwood floors in a motel room if you are not going to clean them properly. And what's up with all the TV remotes everywhere I go being sticky, greasy and dusty? They should include a wipedown with a sanitizing wipe in their daily cleanup. On top of that the room above me sounds like it has hardwood floors as well with a family of kids running back and forth on them (I got here at 10:30pm and it's nearly midnight now). It's a non-smoking room but still smells like smoke as if it is coming in from other rooms through the ventilation system. I will not be staying here another night. The only good thing was the front desk clerk was very nice. Is it that hard to find good housekeeping employees these days? With all the unemployment you'd think they could find better.

"Excellent excellent service! Limo services are not the cheapest so I debated on if this was a route I wanted to pursue for my wedding. So glad I did ! I called nearly 15 limo companies and ended up going with peak limo because of the service and affordable pricing !! Definitely the right choice...my wedding was the same weekend as prom, a big rock concert and prime for weddings! Peak kept the communication open anytime I emailed with an update or change or question I always heard back by the next day- usually within a few hours! I am very big on good customer service and I must say no issues existed with peak in this regard. Also the day of the event we had Ron as our chauffer! Highly recommend!! He was so cool and fun and excited for me! He didn't do too much where he was all in our face but he was there enough for us to know where he was where we could find him and kept it all fun and happy. You would of thought he had already known me! It started raining as we were taking pictures ...he stayed near us to know where we were and was able to move the limo closer so we didn't get too wet. Alssoooooo I would like to add that he had a good sense of direction. Peak Limo is specific about communicating on each stop you want to go to within your time and Ron was prepared and knew where to go we only had to tell him for the pics where we wanted to go at the location since it was hidden. I definitely recommend Ron! I normally do not write reviews this long but I know how daunting finding a limo service can be that will be reliable- especially when it is for a wedding so I did want to emphasize why this one worked out for me personally . :)",positive
"THE Best ride to the airport, Lloyd arrived early, waited patiently, we had Great conversations ALL the way to the Airport. I'm usually not a big talker...but he was a great conversationalist. True Gentleman. I will definitely use their service in the future. AND I only booked my ride the day before--Great company!",positive
"Absolutely 5 star service! I used them for my daughters getaway car after her wedding on 1-7-17. The night before we had a winter storm and recieved 2 to 4 inches of snow, unusual for our area. I was worried they would cancel due to road conditions, but instead they complimentary upgraded us from the Cadillac XTS to the Escalade SUV! Due to the weather we changed the pick up time several times and these guys happily rolled with the punches! Their chauffeur, Andre, was outstanding and delivered our precious cargo safely to their hotel. I would recommend this Limo service to anyone based on our experience. They have the best rates in Charlotte too! I checked around. Heather in the office was amazing and so sweet and polite. She made it all happen! I could not be any happier about this experience! Thank you Peak Limo!!",positive
Absolutely the best car service in the area! We have used Peak on several occasions and they have always impressed us with their services. They are always earlier than their scheduled pick up time. This is a huge plus when you are trying to get to the airport on time! Our most recent trip with Peak was the day after Christmas. Julius was our driver going to the airport. He was very nice and professional. We arrived on one of the busiest days of travel at the airport well within our scheduled drop off time. Thank you Julius!! Ron picked us up upon our arrival back to Charlotte. Of course he was right there ahead of time ready and waiting for us once we gathered our luggage. We have had Ron as our driver before. He's a great guy and was very accommodating to us! Thanks Ron!! I cannot recommend this company highly enough! You will have peace of mind in your travels I can guarantee it! Thank you to everyone at Peak for always going above and beyond! Looking forward to using your service on our next trip!,positive
Absolutely amazing! I used them as my getaway vehicle for our wedding on 09/17/16. Anna-Catherine was our chauffeur and I cannot say anything but nice things about her. We picked the Cadillac XTS and it was gorgeous! Will be doing business with them again.,positive
Transport from Wilson Air to event in Charlotte for our COO went seemless even though we had to change the flight information several times. Our passengers were taken well care of. Thank you Peak Limo!,positive
Used Peak Limo for staff and VIP transportation for corporate event in Charlotte. All went well. Drivers were professional and prompt and vehicles were very clean. Would definitely recommend.,positive
"This is a great car service. I arranged an online reservation for my boss and then had to call and update them regarding his canceled then subsequent new flight that was delayed several times due to bad weather. I asked that the driver stay at the airport to pick up my boss regardless of how long it took, and the dispatcher committed that would happen. His 7 pm flight ended up arriving almost at midnight, and the driver was there to take him to his hotel. Being three thousand miles away running a separate event, this was a huge benefit to me and of course to my boss. I'll be using Peak Limo again in the future when one of my execs travel to Charlotte.",positive
"I happened upon Peak Limo when I was in Charlotte on business a couple years ago. Since then, I have used them several times for business but most recently for a personal trip with my husband and some friends. Their drivers and staff have always been professional and accommodating. Prices are in line with those that I shopped previously. Most importantly, they are always where they say they will be when booked which is important when you are traveling.",positive
"Amazing!!! I called them last minute at 11 pm to pick up my boss from the airport at 6 a.m. Sean at Dispatch said, 'no problem, we'll make it happen'. And they did! My boss said the driver, Lloyd, was there on time -- and was funny, professional and all around FANTASTIC!! I am a super happy customer and I strongly recommend Peak Limo!",positive
"Great experience with them last night. The driver was right on time, the car was spotless and impressive looking, everyone I dealt with at the company was very friendly and professional. Their prices include tax, tip and all other fees so there were no surprise charges at the end of the night. I would use their services again!",positive
"Great experience, what a hidden gem. Aside from being a rescue center, the tour was amazing. Olivia gave us so much information. She was friendly and very patient with the kids. I will make this a stop, and will add to list of future donations.",positive
"Hubby and I took the venomous snake training course on Saturday with Joe as our instructor. WOW doesn't say enough! Top-notch facility, a collection of reptiles that surpasses our local zoo, and a patient, knowledgeable teacher who made us feel at ease with the rattlers. We are so happy we found PHS!",positive
A wonderful experience to see the reptiles of all sizes and species. The facility is on a privately owned property. There are many tanks of tortoises in front to be seen. The crocodile tanks are small but interesting and the amazing sight of a croc with a prosthetic tale. The snake house is loaded with snakes from all over the world. Make sure you schedule and reserve he tour. It is worth it!,positive
"This was our first time here but I'm pretty pleased! We are a reptile family and my 15 year niece wanted to volunteer during one of their youth programs. They show them all around while they help feed, clean cages, etc. and they can hold whatever animals they like! The people who work there are extremely helpful and they save a ton of animals. We will definitely be supporting them in the future.",positive
"I am very impressed with the Phoenix Herpetological Society! We took a group of school children there last Thursday and we were all very pleased with our experience! Our tour guide (I'm sorry I forgot her name) was very knowledgeable about all the animals. I would definitely suggest taking children and adults! The tour is mostly outside and practically in the middle of the desert so make sure you plan accordingly! Bring water, closed toe shoes, and slather on the sunscreen! This tour is by appointment only because the land used to be someone's house and is by other houses. My only complaint is that it took a month or so to officially schedule an appointment but it is well worth the wait!",positive
"What a wonderful day at The Phoenix Herpetological Society! We were fortunate enough to have Aaron, who not only knows his stuff, but is funny and super personable. I was so stoked to go today, I almost didn't sleep last night, and it was even better than anticipated. We saw so many rescued and injured snakes, tortoises, crocodiles, etc...we didn't know where to look first. I can't wait to go back with my grandchildren. :) Thanks for doing what you do, and sharing it with anyone that chooses to go on your tour. Oh....bonus for anyone reading this....they also do parties! We saw a birthday party going in after our tour, not only do they have a special place for the party, they also get a tour for the package price. It is a win win. I can't forget to mention the younger guy that takes care of all the venomous snakes....I'm sorry I can't remember your name...the excitement over your passion for those snakes is truly infectious. They are in such good hands with you, and I hope all the ones you are trying to breed and care for, thrive. You were the icing on my perfect day! The armadillo was ace, the otter was cute as a button, I loved the tortoises, the snake room and all the crocs and alligators...I even got to pet two snakes. :) :) Epic!",positive
"My mother is excellent at finding fun, educational opportunities for our family. She reserved us four spots on one of the ""holiday tours"" that the Phoenix Herpetological Society offers. Cost is $20 for adults and $15 for seniors. (I'm not sure how much children cost; we did not have any in our group.) It was advertised as being two hours in length. We like learning and animals, so we drove out to the desert (almost to Carefree) for the 11 am tour with excitement. Our tour guide, Aaron, did a fantastic job explaining the mission of the animal sanctuary and teaching us all about the animals that we saw on the property. The PHS has been open for 15 years and cares currently for 1,800 animals. 80% of the animals are former pets (legally or illegally owned), and they work closely with Game and Fish to rescue animals. When zoos close, PHS takes in animals, and when PHS helps the animals become healthy enough to place in zoos, they do so. I now will never forget the difference between tortoises and turtles and crocodiles and alligators! I love that PHS works closely with schools and children's camps to promote animal education. Our 11 am tour group had about 20 people in it, mostly seniors and children. Aaron talked loudly and made that people of all heights had an opportunity to see and touch (if desired) the animals that could be touched. He also provided helpful information like that if folks became a little claustrophobic in the venomous snake tank room that they could move outside to wait under shaded picnic tables for the crocodile and alligator part of the tour. It is clear that the owners of PHS and the tour guides and volunteers have such a heart for rescuing and caring for animals. Yay! The downside is that tour guide might not stick to the schedule. As a fellow educator, I know that it can sometimes be hard to keep one's excitement for whatever one is teaching in check. But one has to do it! At the 1 pm mark, we were only just starting the crocodile and alligator part of the tour, and by 1:30 pm, my parents and my boyfriend and I were getting hangry and had reached our max of learning about crocodiles and alligators. Thankfully we were able to find our way out of the maze of outdoor animal environments and leave the tour early, but this meant that we missed seeing the barn of non-venomous snake tanks. Alas, those were the animals that my boyfriend most wanted to see! I understand that many of the non-holiday tours are 3 hours in length, but this one was described as being 2 hours. So plan accordingly when you book your tour, and be prepared to stand and learn for whatever duration you choose! Anyone who is thinking about getting a turtle, tortoise, snake, or other reptile should definitely come here first before making a purchase for their sake and for the animal's sake.",positive
"First off I will say that out guide was very informative, and the place is lovely. We went on a 3 hour tour of the sanctuary and he explained everything in detail. However, when I emailed them to ask if they had hands on encounters I was advised by Christy that the tour is very interactive. I was looking forward to holding some of the safer reptiles. I waited patiently and once the tour was over, all we got to do was feed the tortoises and pet a monitor lizard. No snake holding, nothing like the pictures you see on Yelp. Maybe they did not have one to be held, but the main purpose I went was to hold and interact with the reptiles. It was quite the let down.",negative
"This place is one of Phoenix's best kept secret! I took the visiting family and were very impressed with the tour, the wide variety of reptiles which included crocodiles, a great surprise. I highly recommend you take your family to visit this sanctuary.",positive
"I need to preface this that I HATE snakes and have never found reptiles interesting, friendly, or something I would want to spend time around. I was so pleasantly surprised that I actually really enjoyed taking our group of 13 8-11 year old girls here on a field trip. Christie and Anthony were AMAZING with the girls. We spent 4 hours touring the property and the girls even helped with some service hours to clean some cages. They really educated these girls and made it enjoyable and fun for all. I highly recommend checking out this hidden valley gem.",positive
"Our family loves PHS. We have been on a private tour and to several of their planned events such as the Croc Walk and Open House. My son is obsessed with reptiles, especially snakes and the staff and volunteers are always so helpfully and enthusiastic. Looking forward to their Halloween Even Oct 24th.",positive
"penne, chicken & broccoli, turkey avocado salad, and bbq chicken sandwich were the three items we got during our visit. everything was very tasty. the food was not mind blowing but it was above average.",positive
Horrible service. Seriously worst in years. Dated decore and bathrooms were bad. Not worth your time. There are WAY better restaurants to spend your time in.,negative
"Really great food at a great price! Anytime we are in Vegas we go here! Service is Amazing as well!! Charles, Dan & Kristina are really really sweet and provide awesome service!! Definitely a great place to dine with the family and to have fun!!",positive
"In their old location in the forum shops, they had a good atmosphere and decent food. Now that they moved up stairs, the atmosphere is poor and they left the decent food behind. The tables they have now are low to the floor which required us to sit cross legged in order to be comfortable. The food was down right bad. We got the Texmex roll ups and found they were tasteless and had the consistency of cat food. The macaroni and cheese was more like macaroni soup. All in all if you want decent food while in Vegas, you are not going to find it here.",negative
"It's hard to believe that this place has 2 1/2 stars, but I guess if you are comparing it to the other restaurants located within Cesars Palace then I know why. My S/O and I came on Christmas Day and the service and food were great! We were seated promptly and our waitress took our orders quick and held up a great smile. The entire restaurant was filled with movie memorabilias and they were all interesting to look at. Their place mats had fun facts about celebrities and had several trivia questions. I ordered the chicken parmigiana while my S/O ordered a fried lasagna lol. It looked interesting and he ate the entire thing. Food was good, I was stuffed, and prices weren't too bad (for being on the Strip).",positive
"If I could give ZERO stars I would... The worst food I've had! You couldn't pay me to eat here again! So far I've tried the lasagna roll ups... My stomach turns just thinking about trying to choke it down. The marinara is slightly sweet and just gross.... The pizza tastes like chlorine. The potato skins are mediocre at best... Left overs just warmed up. Old, reheated, pre cooked, chemical tasting discussing junk! I have no idea how PH is still in business???",negative
"We were in search of a good place to eat since where we went to dinner last night was absolutely horrible. We came here around 3pm and the place was damn dear empty that should have been our first warning sign but we can be blind. We were sat and greeted quickly however it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 minutes for our food to come. The food was burned and the burgers were dry. The Thai pizza tasted like peanut butter with a piece of Chicken on it, really gross and not what I expected. I was extremely let down yet again. Then when asking for condiments the server got a little attitude, umm you asked us what we needed. Not only that the prices were outrageous. I will not come back to this restaurant ever again. What a waste of money and time. I do not recommend this place at all. Trust me you will regret it.",negative
Walked in for lunch and the hostess said our waitress would be right with us. Waited about 15 minutes for our waitress to come take our drink orders. No sign of her. She didn't even come by to say she would be with us shortly. We had enough and left and took our money elsewhere.,negative
Bad rude service....i have it another chance....being our choices were limited at late hours...so we ordered the hash breakfast..took 4ever to bring it to the table and it was cold...and obviously it wasn't what we were expecting it was a cold dish of French fries w cold onions and a ham type hash w country potatoes. Yukkkk......the waitress was over worked and looked irritable we had her take food back and obviously we didn't pay for such bad service...please try going else where....the place smells like old stale restaurant and I looked under table cause my napkin fell it was gross e old food they hasn't picked up..and the prices are way out of pocket for the microwave food they serve...yukkk,negative
What an amazing experience I had here! I had the chicken piccata with shrimp and it was delish!! All the hostesses were all friendly and our server/bartender Dana L. was exceptional and very attentive!!!,positive
"I held my wedding reception at Planet Hollywood Restaurant in Caesars Forum on the terrace balcony. Apart from the amazing views of the Las Vegas strip, the food was spectacular. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations for the food but the location was perfect. However, I was blown away by the flawless service and exceptionally great food, not to mention the signature cocktails that were the best we had come across while in Vegas. They also provided the wedding cake from a local cake shop as part of the package which was also amazing. Great value for money with reasonable prices.",positive
Awful Asian food...we got the crispy beef it was sunk in gravy and couldn't find the rice....we sent it back and still got it worse....looks can be deceiving. We also ordered a Singapore noodle and it was bland could not find any beef PR shrimp it was horrible.... And pricey Too!!,negative
Food was not good at all for the price. They forgot to add the chicken to my chicken pasta. Service was not good at all. If you want a drink your better off going to the bar and ordering yourself. My server took 20 min to get me my drink.,negative
Denny's laughs at this dump. The frozen lasagna was barely microwaved past room temperature. Drinks blah. Ambiance OK. Save your money.,negative
"The food was awesome! I had the blackened chicken pasta. So good! 5 stars for the food. The service, however, was pretty bad. Granted, we ate here after a friends wedding so we had a large group, but it was also 10:30pm and there was only a few other tables occupied. It took almost a half an hour to even get our drinks after we'd ordered them. People at our table had gotten their appetizers before any of us got drinks! A different server ended up bringing out drinks. Service was better after we got our food and he managed to keep up on refills- but definitely not a good beginning. I'd rate service a 3. Overall giving it a 4. Food was worth the wait.",positive
"Shitty service, shitty food, and shitty manager. Manager was unbelievably rude towards my party and I will not be returning here again.",negative
It's okay... Typical chain restaurant with mediocre food. Service was not great. Fun atmosphere with movie memorabilia.,negative
"My wife and I were here just 30 mins ago. I donated money at work and received a Gift Certificate (got lucky from a raffle drawing) to dine at PH. Definitely a tourist restuarant. Food was okay. We had 2 full plates of food left, so we asked for 2 boxes meanwhile waiting for our To-Go meal. When we received our To-Go meal, and asked our waiter about our leftover food. He told us that ""oh i thought you were done with them. My bad."" We could have asked for the manager, but we thought today is Labor Day so we didn't want him to get in trouble. The purpose of this Gift Certificate was for a happy night out, but we were disappointed.",negative
"The atmosphere and service here are pretty good, but the food is really sub-par. If the food was bargain-basement, I would be hesitant to recommend. At these prices, they just don't make the cut. I have not been impressed with the food at other Planet Hollywood outlets in the past, but since this was part of a Theater-dinner package, the choice was not ours and we elected to give it a try. If you only care about the atmosphere, go for it. But even the casino buffets have better quality food than this. In my book, PASS! We did not try the bar, so perhaps it is better.",negative
Food was just ok and service was mediocre. It's a long walk to the top of Caesars forum shops to. Overall I wouldn't recommend nor go back.,negative
"Note, the ratings really reflects the lack of service from our waiter and his generally poor attitude. Aside from the charred burger they gave my daughter, the rest of the food was actually pretty good. But the lousy service left such an unpleasant feeling that any good karma was overwhelmed. To begin, we eat early, the restaurant was not crowded and most of the tables in the section we were seated at were empty. We were given a menu to peruse and I noticed a few other tables being seated after us. When our waiter finally showed up to the section, he basically got to EVERYBODY else before making his way to our table. Other people got their drinks before we were even greeted by him. I don't know if he was new, or the hostess didn't tell him who should have been seen to first, but I find this to be absolutely ridiculous.",negative
"On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here. SUPER friendly waiter named Brian. Excellent service, great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95. Coffee was good too. I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service. He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a ""thatta boy"". Not one negative.",positive
"If this was the first time I had ever been here I most certainly would not come back. They are usually good,but today was not their day. First, there were three different parties waiting around noon on a not very busy Thursday. It was almost ten minutes before the hostess showed up. I only wanted an appetizer and ordered potato skins. After waiting almost 30 minutes, what I got was half done potato wedges, with about a tablespoon of sour cream, almost no bacon or chives, and very little cheese. I asked the waitress for ketchup, and she promptly took an order for customers across the waiting room. After almost ten minutes, I finally got the ketchup, about a tablespoon. After I had almost finished my ""meal"", she finally asked if I wanted a drink refill which I got it over 5 min later. Interestingly she said there was ""something going on in the kitchen"". Everyone has a bad day, but managers need to realize that one experience like this can translate into many lost customers. Again, I would return again at some point, but there is never any excuse for food or service like this no matter how bad a day the kitchen is having. Obviously the manager was asleep at the wheel this lunch hour.",negative
"Very slow service, 15 minutes for first glass of water, down hill from there, Food was so/so. Will not be going back here with all the other options. Maybe just a bad night was a Sunday but was not busy for the slow service.",negative
"Food was terrible. The presentation was very bad. We had a waiter who didn't know how to interact with people and would just stare at us awkwardly. Food made us sick afterward. The atmosphere was decent, but it doesn't make up for the food or the terrible wait staff. This was the worst restaurant that we ate at in Vegas, and we got stuck here because we were told that it was similar to Planet Dailies at Planet Hollywood, which was a complete LIE.",negative
"Went here a couple weeks ago. Sucked. All I have to say is; service:blah, food:blah, overall experience: blah. I was expecting more I guess. Don't eat here...there are plenty of other great places to eat in Vegas!!!",negative
"Agree with Randall C's review. We only came here because we had a $10 food credit from the Vegas pass. We got got there at 10:30 am and there was barely anyone there, yet our food took 45 minutes to arrive. We saw a ton of employees working here, standing around, talking, etc. the entire time. Seriously, what are you people doing? When the food arrived, oatmeal was cold and I couldn't get 1 refill of coffee because apparently my waitress forgot. We waited another 20 min for her to come back so we could ask for the check. Then she was rude and gave me an attitude because the Vegas pass we picked up there less than 24 hours before was programmed incorrectly by their staff and had to issue us brand new cards. By this time, the rest of my party was already waiting outside. I haven't experienced service this bad in a long time, will not be back.",negative
"First of all, I think people are making a mistake and reviewing the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino on this page. This page is for the RESTAURANT, which is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. Read the damn address if you don't believe me. I first ate in Planet Hollywood when I was either 12 or 13 years old. The Forum Shops had just opened (this is back when they had some GOOD stores/attractions!) and we stopped in here for lunch. Getting to this place is not easy (having to park in a garage, walk through a casino and hallways, etc.) but is worth it. For the unfamiliar, Planet Hollywood is to the entertainment industry what the Hard Rock Cafe is to music. The restaurant has a ton of movie props and the like on display. Some highlights featured on display here include a miniature used in Top Gun, a Space Shuttle model used in Moonraker, a rifle from Starship Troopers, and even a chariot wheel from Ben-Hur. Any fan of the movie industry will get a kick out of this place. But the biggest surprise - there is MORE to this place than just the movie stuff! The food here is surprisingly good. My choice item is the Spaghetti Pomodoro, which amazingly, is actually one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. The rest of the menu has a good assortment of items, as well. Quite honestly, I don't think I have ever come in here and been disappointed food-wise. Guess some of the disappointed reviewers came on a bad day. My big complaint is that this place NEVER updates their props. It's the same stuff every time. This is cool stuff, but how hard would it be to put up a few new props every few months? Also, the memorabilia for sale in the gift shop tends to be a bit overpriced. I wish they would movie this place to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino; that place is a lot more convenient and easy to get around in. Still, with food this good, it's hard to fault the place. Be you a tourist or local, this is one place worth checking out.",positive
"Room was nice - but you need more than one luggage rack because there is no place else to put your suitcase. We had trash sitting outside of our door when we checked in (liked someone else on here mentioned) and it was there for a day. We had reserved 2 rooms through Expedia and I said they didn't have to be connecting but I would like to have them close. We were on the 18th floor and our other party was on the 10th floor, and also we were in different towers, so much for being close. Forget the newpaper!!!! Also, the pool area really needs some better music - come on this is Planet Hollywood, supposed to be a hip hotel!!",negative
"eh, not really impressed. my room featured the movie, ""toys"" starring Robin Williams. Really? the shower was terrible, the pipes woke me up in the middle of night with a horrible screeching noise. also, the layout of this hotel is weird and i got terribly lost trying to find the check-in. not a fav!",negative
Short notice request and they got it done quickly and easily. Looked just like pics and showed up on time and returned on time. We loved the driver George! He had a group of young people and was great! Will try them again for the next event too.,positive
"We used platinum for our wedding this past Saturday, and they were great! They were right on schedule, and the driver was awesome! Thanks so much! I definitely recommend them.",positive
I hired platinum rides to take my daughter out for her 10th birthday. I have been going through breast cancer treatment and she has been through a lot this year so I wanted to do something extra special for her. I have never rented a limo before... Frank was wonderful in helping me select something she would love! He listened to me tell him about my daughter (she is super fancy)... And the price was very reasonable. Steven the driver was wonderful! He made my daughter feel very special! I would definitely recommend platinum rides to friends and family! Thank you Frank and Steven!,positive
"Do not hire this company. We contacted Platinum Rides for an estimate and they gave us the hard sell. They seemed like nice people, told us it was a family business whose goal is to accommodate their customers but that's all part of their scheme. We agreed on a price of $600 for a pickup/drop off. It was an outrageous price tag to begin with but we thought it would be a fun experience with our friends. What the driver doesn't make clear is if you make even one stop, they charge you a wait fee of $600. In total, we were charged $1,200 for 60 minutes in the limo. That's $20 a minute. The driver had us sign a receipt (in the dark) once we were dropped off. He said it was just a confirmation receipt saying that we successfully arrived at our destination. Apparently that signature gave them the right to charge the credit card on file the additional $600. We called them and said we understood why there was a fee but that $1,200 for 60 minutes was price gouging. They were rude, unprofessional and completely unwilling to bring the fee down. We wish we would have read ALL of their reviews because it's clear this isn't the first time they've done this to their customers (and their ""fees"" are getting higher and higher). We're reporting them to the BBB. We have lawyers involved. So many great options in Scottsdale for a limo service - don't use these guys. You will get ripped off.",negative
Came through in a party bus emergency. Called on Friday afternoon and they came through with one days notice. Awesome service at a fair price. As far as I'm concerned this is the only limo service in the area,positive
We had a last minute Prom reservation and Joey took excellent care of us and gave us an excellent price. We had a brand new limo that was way more than expected! It is a beautiful car with really cool lights and everything you need to make your ride comfortable. The best part about it was Tony the driver! He was very professional and made sure that our daughters and their friends were taken care of. This is the ONLY Limo company that my family intends on using! Thank you Platinum Rides and especially My Man Tony!!,positive
Best party bus I have ever hosted! The driver was extremely kind and got us to our location safety. Very great homecoming,positive
"Company was referred by a friend who is an event planner for our HOA. The buses are very nice and have been on them previously. HOWEVER do not make a reservation until 100% certain your plans are solid and you have an accurate head count. I made a reservation for a 30 passenger bus and tried to change to a smaller one more than 30 days before my event. They would not allow cancellations, or down size the bus. Unfortunately they were unaccommodating and neither myself our our HOA would use the company again. It is unfortunate so check with competitors before booking. The owner of this company sent me no less than 20 harassing texts, and at no time addressed the question I posed to him about finding a smaller, less expensive bus. All he cared about was whether I would pull down my Yelp review. This guy would be out of business if I posted these texts. Oh, and BTW they charge twice as much as competitors. Go to AZLIMO.com, half the cost, better cancelation policy and professional customer service. Will probably end up in small claims at this rate.",negative
"I rented a black long limo yesterday and was very impressed. I loved the tinted windows. The limo driver was on time and very polite. He drove me around different places, restaurants, and even to a place for me to get some wine. He helped me with my blue tooth phone connection on the limo blue tooth nice stereo system. There was ice and water for me in limo. I enjoyed the interior limo colorful lights. He dropped me back at my hotel safely at the time I requested. Thanks you guys! I totally would hire them again in the future! :)",positive
"We booked platinum rides for a 30th bday party, and couldn't have been more thrilled with our experience. The driver was prompt, courteous, and super accommodating. We booked a stretch navigator for a 5 hour night, and when our plans changed unexpectedly and we needed an extra hour, he was very patient and professional. Wish he would have taken some pictures in front of the limo for us, but we hired a limo...not a photographer...i get it. The car was in great condition, had plenty of glassware and ice, and comfortably sat 14 (we even had space for more). The limo took our classy affair to the next level. When booking they do have a no refund policy, so make sure of your dates and times. But the office was a pleasure to work with and overall a very reliable company. We will definitely use platinum rides for our limo services in the future.",positive
"So disgusted and disappointed I hate when I feel like I'm being ripped off. I will spread the Word all over so others don't experience my disgust. The company I used to book the party bus ""platinum ride limos"" apparently just like to rip ppl off and take there money. They are the most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with. I was late 15 mins from being dropped back off which the driver was aware of and stated not to worry. I checked my credit card and They charged me an additional $135, which was a full hour fee for services they DID NOT provide. Once I saw this additional charge on top of all that I spent for there services not to mention leaving the driver a Big Tip Just to basically be dropped off. I called the owner who basically implied that money meant more to him then his customers or future business of others would. I personally will spread this throughout Arizona. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM TRUST ME. If I could give a negative star I would, no need and sending a pretend response on the bottom of the review actting surprised or as if your company had no knowledge of this. Better yet Attempting to make fellow yelpers believe differently. I attempted and spent majority of my morning conversing about this with your company who could careless. It was very clear to me speaking with management that you could careless about your customers. Sad to see people could careless about customer service, dignity, and the good of there so called businesses. ANOTHER EDIT-AFTER I WROTE THIS REVIEW THE OWNER ""FRANK""DECIDED TO CALL AND MAKE THREAT TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW OR ELSE. NOT TO MENTION ADDITIONAL HARRASMENT TRUST ME AND BOOK ELSE WHERE.",negative
"Joey was so awesome to work with. I made a reservation in less than 24 hours, not only was he willing and excited to help he also gave me the best price ever. The website is so easy to navigate through and I didn't have to fill out 18 forms to get a quote. I would recommend EVERYONE to use them. I will definitely use them for persona and work functions from now on. THANK YOU!!!!",positive
Great experience all the way! I planned a last minute birthday party for my son. I had 13 eleven yr old boys to take from all the way up in Cave Creek to Camelback to play paint ball. I had no way to transport so I thought a limo would be fun. I planned this 2 days before the event and received EXCELLENT fast service online from their website by Joey. Unlike other companies there was an immediate quote from their website and I could book quickly. It is a family owned business and I got a great rate. Lonnie our driver was awesome! He was helpful unloading gear and very patient with our crazy group. If I ever need a limo I will be calling Joey! Thanks guys!,positive
"Frank and Joey, I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for the amazing service and awesome time Saturday night. Jordan was awesome and really took care of us. In addition, because it was a really crazy holiday weekend, he put up with lots of crazy drivers and jam packed streets. It was such a relief knowing that we didn't have to navigate any of that and could continue having a good time. Thank you! We will absolutely do this again.",positive
Man one of the best limo services I have taken. Our driver was on point with picking us up and knew exactly our need through out the night. He was spot on with the svc he delivered. I'll use them again,positive
"I hired Platinum Rides to take a group of fellow classmates out to Scottsdale for a night out after we had all finished our final exams. Although we had a large number in our group, the company and its bus driver, Mike, was very accommodating to us, picked us up on time and got us to where we needed to be, then took us back home safely to finish the night. The party busses were top of the line and everyone had a fantastic time en route to Scottsdale. I initially hired this company because their prices were unmatched and they were able to accommodate such a large group so easily. The whole process was very smooth from start to finish and I would recommend Platinum Rides to anyone who is considering renting a bus for a large group.",positive
"Driver got lost and made us late for the event - owner didn't care! We hired a limo so we wouldn't have any issues and would be at our event on time. I would never use them again. If I could give them zero stars, I would.",negative
Platinum Rides Scottsdale was on time and as promised. We asked for their black stretch Chrysler 300 and that's what we got. Driver Mike was courteous and helped with our photos. I had no issues with the process and was able to get through to them on the first and subsequent phone calls. I got a reminder email 24 hours before service.,positive
What a fantastic experience! The Owner was very gracious and the driver fantastic. Not to mention the party bus was amazing. Clean and fun. Took my son and some friends out for a great celebration. Would hire them again in a heartbeat!,positive
"Sweet 16 pt 2 So I promised I'd give you the second part of the review after the great customer service we recieved at the time of reservation. I'll tell you what, the bus and the driver were equally as awesome as Frank and Joey!!!! His name was Gene and he was so very helpful. My daughter and her friends had the most AWESOME experience and Gene made sure of it. I knew they were in great hands with him so much so that I couldn't help but give him a hug because he felt like part of our family. Platinum Rides (Joey, Frank and Gene) helped me make my only daughters sweet 16 birthday a day she will never forget and I will always be a customer of theirs for any occassion. We rented the party bus and it fit 23 teeanagers more than comfortably. It was a great price and the bus was AMAZING! I've never heard so many oooo's and aaaaah's!! Gene showed up early and gave suggestions on things they could do and places they could go to make the experience even better. He went over the rules and how to work the equipment on the bus and after that they were off. The teens even raved about how friendly and helpful he was. We truly could not have asked for a better experience! Thanks Platinum Rides!! (I know that last part was corny but I don't care!!!) =)",positive
"We rented a bus for a concert, the bus was nice but smaller than we thought. The problem was with the driver, from the time he showed up he was hard to deal with. Everything seemed like it was an issue. His driving was very erratic causing drinks to slide off the counter, which we cleaned up. His whole attitude was negative and unwilling to work with us.",negative
"Hello, after spending hours reading reviews, trying to decide who I should hire for my buddy's bachelor party. I chose Platinum, me and all my friend had a EXCELLENT time! The driver was professional, owners are great to deal with, clean and not to mention a kick ass bus! Anyway thanks again Frank & Joe.",positive
"Hi Frank and Joey, I just wanted to say thank you for the party bus rental. The bus was AWESOME!!! I have never seen a bus jazzed up like that it was way more than I expected. Our group had a blast and your driver was absolutely hilarious. He had us all in stiches and he is a keeper! Thanks again guys I hope you end up reading this as I really did have a wonderful time. Take care and thanks again!",positive
"Platinum Rides is a company I would never hire for any event for any reason. My very close friends were getting married and I was driving over in the limo to the venue with the groom. The driver never notified the groom that the car had arrived, so 30-minutes past the pick-up time, the groom walked outside and found out the limo had been outside the entire time. It was 95-degrees outside, so we go to get into the limo when the driver scolds us for getting in because the groom had to fill out paperwork which the groom thought had already been taken care of. When the driver dropped us off, she accused me and one other of stealing a champagne flute even though we never opened the two bottles or touched the flutes. Additionally, I witnessed phone conversations between the newly weds the day after their wedding with Joey and Frank, the owners of Platinum. They were rude, unprofessional, and lied about the circumstances that occurred that day and evening. The wedding was absolutely beautiful and we all had an amazing time, but the thorn in the side of many on this special day, especially the bride and groom, was Platinum. Coming from New York, I have never witnessed such disrespect from a business owner towards paying customers, and I hope that Joey and Frank learn what customer service is because it is the way they spoke to the bride and groom and the way they treated the guests that will surely lose them business in the future. We all would have rather taken a cab home than have had to deal with Platinum.",negative
"My husband and I were extremely disappointed with Platinum Ride Limousine and would strongly discourage anyone from using them. Our contract stated we would receive a one hour, one way transportation from our venue to our resort. I was starving and had the driver of our Towncar go through the drive-thru of Jack in the Box, which is a four minute longer route, only to find out at the drive-thru window that there would ""potentially"" be an additional charge even though it was recommended by Joey DeVenuto to ""take the long route"". My husband immediately contacted Joey and was told that there would be an additional charge due to the additional stop. Letting cooler heads prevail, we stopped communication, only to find out that the charge was $150 . We did not feel this was warranted due to the fact that we never left the car, did not go past our one hour window, and would have appreciated the accommodations and understanding that this was our wedding night and this was the last thing with which we wanted to end our perfect evening. When conversation continued with Joey at the later date, my husband became frustrated and I decided to handle the situation with a level head. I spoke with Frank DeVenuto, co-owner of Platinum Rides, who became defensive of his brother and escalated the situation by stating that he has police officers who drive for him and private investigators who will find where we work if we ""defamed"" his business operations through any social media platform. He attacked my husband and my character and said he would take all measures necessary to prove that we were ""ridiculous"" and terrible customers. He turned business matters into a personal conflict. We tried to complete this business transaction multiple times throughout the conversation, however he felt it was necessary to continue his barrage of insults before finally accepting our payment information. This night was perfect, excluding any interaction with this business. STRONGLY DISCOURAGE!",negative
"Driver showed up and waited outside about 10 minutes for our group. However, after we got in and he left, the disaster started. Although we booked the event and told them exactly where we needed to go, he got lost. He never bothered to get directions prior to the event causing us to arrive almost 40 minutes late. When we called the owner, he did absolutely nothing to compensate us for his company's poor service resulting in our excessively late arrival. I would never use this company if you have to be somewhere at a specific time...it's just too risky and they don't care if they mess up your plans.",negative
"This was my first time looking to rent a limo for a birthday. I'm so glad I chose platinum rides! Getting a reservation was so simple and easy. Took about 15 minutes to get setup! On the day of the pickup, the limo driver was 15 minutes early, which was great! Driver was very attentive and was willing to go above and beyond! We had forgot to lock our car door back at the pickup spot and the driver was willing to drive back and lock it for us! How cool is that! Overall I had an amazing experience and recommend platinum rides.",positive
"Do not use this company! Although their party buses are nice, their customer service is horrible. The utter lack of professionalism ruined what would have been an otherwise nice event for our group. Also be warned that although their rates might seem low they charge numerous fees. This is the first bad review I have ever written on Yelp or anywhere for that matter. I usually only post positive reviews and keep such opinions to myself, so you can imagine the poor level of customer service I must have experienced for me to feel it necessary to post a negative review. As a small business owner myself I know what level of service businesses should provide to their customers and this company does not even come close to making the grade. Sorry to have to be a downer, but I would look elsewhere.",negative
"From my first interaction with Platinum Rides, I was impressed with this company. Before even getting all the details about my event for which I wanted to book them, they offered to show me their entire fleet of vehicles so I was choosing the right one for my party. Because we were going out for my husband's birthday party, we reserved one of their limo buses. Holy crap, that bus was amazing. It was beautiful, spacious, with a great sound system, and came stocked with waters and glasses for us all to use! Plus, our drive was incredible. Not only was he punctual and attentive, but he was cool and fun to hang with as well. I was so glad we got such an awesome driver for the night! Really, the night couldn't have gone any better, everyone had a blast, and I can't wait for an excuse to reserve another bus from them again.",positive
"After calling 4 different Limo companies, and filling out 2 other online price quotes... i was willing to call off my 21st birthday party bus. No one was friendly, the companies i was interested in either took 3 weeks to get back to me or acted like i was crazy for asking questions about what was included in the fee. One company even said that i should email them questions because he was too busy... i did, no response. Then I called Platinum Rides, after looking at their great website of course. One of the owners answered the phone and treated me like i was his friend . He was willing to answer all of my questions. He even made some recomendations and where we could get in without cover. Their price was by far the best. When the big night came, the driver was on time and was very professional (esp. for dealing with 15 drunks). He took us everywhere we wanted and cleaned up the bus while we were at out last stop. But, word of warning... if you break a champagne glass... they charge you $20.",positive
"Great staff from reservation to checkout, manager Vijay took great care of us. Great location for ASU, good value. Definitely stay here again when we're visiting ASU.",positive
I have stayed at The Quality Inn ASU multiple times and everytime I return i look forward to my stay. The staff is very friendly and are always willing to help. The housekeeping does an outstanding job as the rooms are always immaculate. You also can't complain about the free amenities such as the hot breakfast. (not just your run of the mill continental). One last thing to comment on is the closeness to entertainment such as Mill Ave. I will continue to stay here as long as I return to Tempe.,positive
This is the worst place to stay. When we got there the parking was limited. Our room was on the third floor and when we first arrived the room was not as clean as I would've liked. The night stand had gunk on it and gave the room a filthy feel to it. Then it has these weird two way mirrors across the entire wall. We stayed anyway because there were no other rooms available due to the marathon. When we left my daughter left her DVD player behind. We know she left it there because we didn't go anywhere else. We called them back that day and no one could help us. They told us to call back the next day. I just got off the phone with the manager and he says nothing has been turned in but wont question his employee about it. One of the maids took it with tour a doubt because we couldn't have left it anywhere else. It's said to think he would stand up for an employees who have no integrity and have probably been taking stuff for the past 12 years.,negative
We stayed here for 5 days The rooms are clean and the breakfast served is good specially the muffins It's at walking distance from ASU. I forgot my charger here and came back 2 days later they had it at the reception so that was pretty convenient. Staff is friendly and I think it's reasonably priced.,positive
"As was mentioned before, the room is outdated but I found my room very clean. Also, I found the staff quite friendly. It would be helpful to have the entrance clearly marked. With the pool being out in the front, my spouse and I wondered where the entrance was located. I found the downstairs breakfast nook a little too confining. They could open the area up a bit and it would make it seem more comfortable.",negative
"Staff (owner I think) very friendly (3) stars Bed bugs (-5) stars Room Change, hot water only (hell fire hot) - 5 stars",negative
"This place is gross. My mom and I picked this place purely based on location, since it's near my new apartment building that I was moving into. It looks run down on the outside. The pool looks really gross, wouldn't suggest going in it. When we got to our room, we found a partially eaten sandwich in the fridge - thanks housekeeping. We got a room with a pull out couch bed because it was cheaper and I'd only be here one night. Mom and I pulled the bed out after a lot of work and... Ew... Didn't look like anything I would want to sleep in. Blanket has holes in it and the sheets were yellow at the ends. So I slept on the sofa. Literally nothing here seemed clean. Found a long hair on the towels. Also, the flooring in our bathroom was loose right under the toilet!!!!!! So when you sat on the toilet it would rock back and forth. The shower wouldn't drain properly, and after 10 minutes the water was up to my ankles. It was also hard to wash my hair because of the low water pressure. Glad I only had to stay one night because this place was awful. 0/5, would not recommend.",negative
"Run down room decor, no hair dryer in bathroom. Looks like an old college dorm. Front desk staff upon check in was not cheerful, or very on the ball. Had made park and fly reservation, with directions we needed pick up from shuttle at 4:15 am. Upon check in, were told shuttle would be there at 5:30 am, our boarding time for plane. After several phone calls to driver, we reserved a taxi,which arrived promptly at 4:15. It took us over an hour to chck in due to the mix up with shuttle. When we got to the room, our keys didn't work. All in all we paid 110 dollars for 5 hours use of the room. Will never stay here again, and neither should you! We were offered a 10%discount for inconvenience, which was not enough! The customer is not always right here, go elsewhere!",negative
"Deplorable. I was with a group and check-in is always at 3 pm. We arrived at 4 pm and only 2 of the rooms were available. I was required to sign a release for each room, requiring none of the group members would smoke. When I arrived at my room, I guarantee not only had someone been smoking in there, but someone had been smoking a cigar. Putrid. I was also blessed with having the room directly above the first floor restroom, which apparently does not have an ample ventilation system, so my room smelled like a cesspool the entire weekend. So, if you don't mind smelling like a cesspool for the weekend, I guess this is the place to be. Oh yeah, and they decided it wasn't necessary to clean the pool, either. There was garbage floating in the bottom and true pond scum floating there. Not very pleasant.",negative
"First time I had to get a hotel since I moved out of Phoenix. Staff was nice and let me get away with a late check out. Complementary breakfast was below par, the rooms were decent, and the price was competitive. Overall it was a very middle of the road hotel but I uprated one star due to its close proximity to Four Peaks Brewery.",positive
"First of all, the 3 stars are for the staff at the front desk and restaurant. Great at check in and check out. The staff in the restaurant were awesome! My room, not so great. I went on business. Arrived late after a 10 hour drive, so I was very tired. Had dinner and food was good. Water, is terrible, but I'm sure it's just the area. Got up to my room and noticed a microwave outside the elevator. Strange. But, there wasn't one in the room, so the whole floor had to share the microwave, I guess. I opted not to use it. Room was not super clean. I usually wipe everything down anyway, so there was definitely dirt and grime on my cloth. Cabinets were dusty. Yuk! After getting ready for bed, I turned down the bedspread....I never use them if they aren't a fresh clean sheet....and noticed there was something between the sheet and mattress pad. It was the plastic cap to a disposable razor! Weird! Then I saw a hair on the sheet.....ugh!! I hate to think sheets weren't changed at all, but what would you think?? It was a king bed and I was too tired to change rooms, so I slept on the other side of the bed....close to the edge. Always take my own pillow. The A/C turned on and off, but couldn't quite regulate temp.....afterall, it's AZ. Used my earplugs to drown out the sound of A/C and fridge going on and off. The clock radio was behind the nightstand on the floor.....it was filthy, dusty back there so I opted to leave it alone. Used my cell for my alarm anyway. My stay was for 3 nights. I didn't allow housekeeping to come back in my room while I worked for 2 days. Thankfully, each night I returned I was dead tired to care about anything else. I let desk know at check out. Gave her the plastic cap to the disposable razor. She apologized, obviously embarrassed. I would never return here.....even though my employer paid for the room.",negative
"We had to book quickly so, talking on the phone to Radisson came up with a great deal. Upon arrival, very late at night, the guy was very helpful. We stayed on the 3rd floor and are room was clean and attractive. I noticed the ceilings were quite high, though. ( see photo) Every body working there was friendly and helpful. Their complimentary breakfast was done well with plenty of variety. The dining area could use a new carpet but, everything else was good. The only change I would make would be to add small safes in the rooms.",positive
"Stayed here for four days for my annual Spring Training baseball trip to Arizona. Staying at the Radisson. I had one of the best times ever on this vacation. A big part of that was my stay here. The staff was very easy going and friendly yet professional and very attentive to my needs. There wasn't anything I needed at the time that they didn't provide me. This included extra clean towels and blankets. The customer service alone is a big reason I am considering staying here next year. The hotel itself was away from the busier parts of town but centrally located to any of the ballparks we wanted to go to. Within walking distance they also have a Circle K and a Ruby Tuesday restaurant nearby. It is also minutes away from the airport. So this hotel was perfectly located. They do have a pool, a restaurant and a bar within the hotel. Didn't take advantage of either so I can't really speak on them. I did take advantage of their gym though. The gym equipment were in good working order, clean and looked to be on the newer side. Everything you needed to get a good workout in. The rooms are not huge but not small either. My bed however was a huge king sized bed. Everything about my bed was comfortable from the mattress to the pillows. I slept like a baby waking up ready to tackle the day. My only complaint about my room were the lack of USB ports for my electronics. Luckily I brought my wall adapters so no problem there. Overall a great stay. Definitely thinking about staying here again next time I am in Arizona. Great staff. Perfectly located. Nice gym. Clean, reasonably priced rooms. What else you want? This hotel is a winner. Stay here.",positive
"Very poor customer service when checking in. Rude Manager. Employees were apologizing for her. Room is SUPER loud! There's a scheduled party right outside our room until 10pm (complete with loud speakers and music) and we have to be up at 4:30am. They need to sound proof rooms exposed to common areas subject to these conditions. I have traveled 3-4 days a week for the last 20 years and have never written a yelp review about a hotel until this, it was so bad.",negative
"It could be definitely better, you get a wake up call in 5:30 AM without you requesting that. When you call the front desk to ask why there answer is Oh sorry.",negative
"Great location, we were at multiple ball parks, downtown and the hotel was easy to eat between places. Pool was perfect. Rooms were clean and a little outdated. Bathroom is small. Staff was kind and accommodating. We didn't eat at restaurant. We flew in early and they let us check in early no questions. We will come back. We did have to pay for parking, which was not advertised.",positive
"I'm rating this as compared to other Radissons/similar hotels, not hotels in general and it still gets 2 stars. I have lots of points with the Club Carlson loyalty program and booked my two night stay using points. Upon check-in, the front desk staff seemed fine and we got a parking spot (with a permit) and the room was adequate. Then, it just went downhill. I'll bullet the issues we encountered: 1) The thermostat is digital and give you the illusion that you control the temperature in your room. You do not. Ours was set at 65 and fluctuated between sweltering and freezing multiple times during the day and night. 2) The shower had horrendous water pressure. 3) The second night, we arrived late (around midnight) and there was no parking. None. I walked into the lobby along with three unrelated other drivers to complain and we were told to park in the two handicap spots or the blocked off area near the dumpster. Both of which are illegal. I don't know if they don't enforce the permit thing or if they are aware they don't have enough spaces for each room or what, but I beat out a person for the last dumpster spot. 4) I saw today (3 days after checkout), that I was charged $100. I called and they removed it, but it was a reservation booked completely with points so that never should have happened. The room was a fairly spacious suite though, with separate living and sleeping areas and the bed was comfortable. We didn't use any of the other amenities, so I can't justify more than 2 stars.",negative
"Worst Hotel ever, we made a reservation for 3 people a month ago and now they are making us sleep on the FLOOR!! No extra mattress no room fit for what we made reservations for and no satisfaction from management. Our WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!",negative
We recently stayed at this hotel for a night before our very early flight the next day. It did the job for our one night and we would stay here again if we needed to be near the airport. Check-in was fine. We stood in front of a couple of desk agents for a minute or two while they typed away at their computers before either one acknowledged us but then they quickly checked us in. The room was spacious and smartly set up for the amount of room it had. The bed was a king and it was comfy enough except the pillows were terrible and flat. Finally this hotel has it's own restaurant and bar which is always a plus. We didn't know that so we had stopped at the nearby Ruby Tuesdays on our way in.,positive
I stayed here last night. The guy at the counter was extremely nice. He upgraded us to the honeymoon suite after hearing this is our first trip together. That was really sweet. My whole stay here was amazing. I didn't get to try any of the restuarnt since I wanted to be a foodie and find unique places while on my mini vacation. I would definitely come back here but in the winter time where it's less humid and more cooler.,positive
I stayed at this hotel for 10 days during a company training. I must say that my experience overall was great. From the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out. The staff was always friendly and prompt to accommodate my every need. The room was very spacious and ideal for a business trip. It consist of your normal set up plus a couch and a business desk. The wifi was reliable and did not have any issues getting work done or sending and replying to emails. The restaurant and bar staff were excellent and did not hesitate to make sure we had a good meal and experience. The beer selection is limited for draft but I got to tried 3 different AZ beers. I would definitely recommend this hotel chain to my company for future training stays.,positive
The room service breakfast is a definite to pass on. I ordered my eggs over easy and received them over hard. The french toast was dry and bland. The strawberries were too tart and sour. The coffee was mediocre a la Folgers.,negative
I stayed here for one evening and the place was very good. The staff is friendly and the place was clean. They worked on any problems in a quick manner like when I asked them to swap out the TV remote control. It was swapped in a manner of minutes by the maintenance person. There is a bar and restaurant connected to this place and they are both good places. All in all you will get your moneys worth if you stay at this hotel.,positive
"I want to start off by saying the Radisson Phoenix airport is one of the best hotels in the valley hands-down. From the time you walk in you will meet a wonderful lady named Joy who is one the front desk associates that works there, to the time you leave you should be satisfied. I am a frequent visitor to this hotel I stay there about 2 to 3 times a month. The beds are absolutely phenomenal, you can also ask for comfort control pillows so you can need to get them soft or firm. don't be surprise if you sleep for a couple weeks lol. The rooms are a little pricey at times, so make sure you get your Club Carlson rewards card and keep track of your points because they build up pretty fast compared to other rewards cards. Also you can use points plus cash which will give you a really good rate on the room when they are high. I have had a problem once with one of the members at the front desk, but the general manager Ted can't remember his last name offhand. Resolved the issue very fast and efficiently. I Recommend this hotel to anybody either staying for a long period of time or passing through. One thing I forgot to mention is the restaurant in the hotel called the (RBG Grill) is absolutely amazing. I recommend that you try there are hamburger, it is definitely one of the hidden gems in the valley.",positive
"This hotel was a little below my expectation. The rooms are outdated and dark. There is just not enough light in there. The carpet is old. The place was clean, however. The breakfast bar was decent and reception service was also nice. The location is great since it is close to the airport and two blocks from the light rail station.",negative
"*I originally had this review on another site but I thought I'd add it here as well* I've stayed at the airport Radisson twice now for Phoenix Comicon. They have a great convention rate and although it's by the airport the light rail is just a short walk away. The light rail takes about ten minutes to get to the convention center. Yes, there are nice hotels right next to the convention center. Yes, you will miss out on the fun stuff going on in downtown Phoenix during the con. But if you value a good night's sleep away from the noise, this is a great place to stay. The rooms at the Radisson are great, especially the beds! I can't remember the last time I slept so well. The food is expensive but that is fairly typical for this kind of hotel. We ate breakfast at the cafe and had some burgers at the bar. The food is okay, nothing great, but you might find yourself caving in to it anyway since they have a captive audience. Another advantage to the great service, if you ask at the front desk they can provide you with a number of menus to local places that deliver to the hotel. There is a pizza place that they recommend (can't remember the name offhand) and it is really good. The service is excellent. We wanted to take a few beers up to the room on our last night there. Not only did the bartender suggest a good beer that wasn't on the menu but she put together an ice bucket and bottle opener for us! She could not have been nicer. That's just the thing you want after triple digit Phoenix heat! If I come to the convention next year I'm staying here for sure.",positive
"Made a trip to Phoenix to visit family and one of my family members booked a stay at the Radisson for my kids, wife and myself. I'll admit I was a little worries. Only because I've never stayed at a radisson. And I've heard mixed reviews. Oh was I wrong. Matt Ezor and his staff have it dialed in. Excellent service and a no hassle check in. I got to the hotel at 2 am. The last thing I want to do is sign liability papers or of any sort. The breakfast was awesome. Kids loved the waffle machine. And if I may say so myself. They are pretty darn good. Thank you staff. The radisson is now the hotel for my family and I when we vist Phoenix.",positive
"Exceeded expectations. We paid about $50/night and had just come from the St Regis ($500/night) and so we weren't expecting much, but it worked out really well. Not fancy, but it's comfortable and everything works. Beds are comfortable, AC worked great, no noise issues, easy wifi in the room, airport shuttle service was fast and easy, and staff were friendly. Coffee and two free bottled waters in the room. Restaurant and bar are decent. Can't ask for more at this price. There are definitely blemishes, like our room door didn't close without pulling really hard and the view from our window is pretty sad. But given our good experience and the great price, I choose five stars. Keep up the good work!",positive
"I'm typically not picky about my hotels. Clean room, semi decent service will typically earn you 3-4 stars in itself. I'd like to say they were busy that week...but it's Phoenix....and pretty empty around if I say so myself...so NO you can't have that excuse. 1) I'm a frequent traveler and I tend to sign up for hotel chain reward memberships. I stick with Hyatt, Marriott and assumed I would sign with Raddison and stick with these 3 chains. They did not offer me the rewards card during check-in. The gal at the front desk seemed out of it noting it to be very busy....It's Sunday night...there's no one else here but me checking in.... 2) I get placed in perhaps the worst floor (2nd) with the worst room. I had no view out the window...I saw air conditioning units AND it made a hissing sound every 10 minutes which didn't bother me until I noticed it after the 2nd night. I asked for a room change - ""Sorry no other rooms available"" 3) The business center looked great. I went in to try to do some studying but the chairs were so low compared to the table. No these are not the height adjustable chairs... My less than satisfying visit here resulted in me booking at the Marriott for my next stay....",negative
"I travel a lot and had a fine experience here. Friendly staff and the bar was open as long as there were people. Also enjoyed the 24 hour access to gym. Didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar/ lounge area was a nice place to get work done in the evening. Lots of outlets are available. On the downside, my view from the room was of air conditioners.",positive
"Very comfortable bed, toiletries were better than most, breakfast buffet worth the additional few bucks and a terrific staff. Clean. Will return.",positive
"One of the best place to stay in Phoenix, yeah sure there are plenty other hotels in Phoenix, many of them are really good but this has definitely been one of the best places that I have stayed at. The hotel at the staff were incredible. They were super friendly and all had great personalities and it was pleasure to talk to them and I was confident that they could help me with any problems I had which fortunately I didn't have any. The room itself was very clean and I quite liked the d√©cor. It was pretty spacious and stuff and everything in the room seemed to work. I was certainly a refreshing and relaxing stay whilst I was there and allowed me to get some of my work done as well as explore the city with my wife. Fortunately the hotel wasn't too far away from any restaurants and stores.",positive
"This place is very close to the airport. My company put me up for the night here, so I can't comment on the price. But the accommodations are nice. We got the exec suites I think. When we arrived at about 10:30 at night, there was a bit of hassle at the front desk..but it got sorted out. The bar stayed open a little late for us, which was cool. The room was nice and clean. The bed was super comfy and I literally fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. The only nit-picky thing I can think of was the room didn't have the black out curtains. The curtains that they have are basically see through...which could be an issue for obvious reasons. But it wasn't a huge issue for me. We ate breakfast at the restaurant that is a part of the hotel and the food was good :). I would stay at the Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport again.",positive
This hotel didn't really do much for me. The guy at the check in desk was a total mess and they was a really long line. The room was clean enough but it had a distinct smell that I did not really prefer. I also ordered room service from the restaurant and found it to be very over priced for what they had to offer. I am sure there are other hotels by the airport that are much better than this one.,negative
"I've stayed here 3 times now on different trips between Cali and New Mexico/West Texas. The first was in February 2009, second March 2010 and latest was May 2013. The hotel didn't change much between stays; however, the hotel didn't have sleep number beds before this last time. Overall my stay has always been good. Somehow I swear I've gotten the same room all 3 times since the view has been nearly identical each time. The room has always been clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is good, but not great which makes it definitely NOT worth the full price of about $15 (it's not included). I recommended using the lottery upgrade scheme they have available if you book in advance as you can get the buffet for $8 that way. The in house restaurant is above average, but pricey for what you get.",positive
"When I made the reservation for the Radisson I was told about ""Breakfast for a Buck"" which I agreed sounded like a good deal. No problems with check-in and the room was clean. No mini-refrig which disappointed my husband especially since this is a conference oriented hotel. Happy Hour was fun and the bartender chatty. Next day, the really friendly server was totally unaware of the breakfast for a buck promotion. Word to Sales Dept: make sure EVERYONE knows on staff including bartenders when customers make references to it. Check out was strange as the CSR was counting money and wouldn't even look or say ""be right with you"" to my husband. Not friendly checking out, y'all come back here not an option. Still, we liked the Radisson and the Sleep Number beds, even the one that roared when you started it up like a GTO. Cracked us up.",positive
Good room for a great value! I stayed there recently with my husband during an anniversary trip to phoenix. It was conveniently located near the airport as well as to a lot of places we wanted to go to. The room was very decent expecially for the price we paid. The staff was friendly and we checked in and out quickly without any hassels. I would definitely stay here again in the future.,positive
"Great rates, great location, and very nice rooms. I stayed here on a weekday and I was upgraded to the Business Suites with the Sleep Number Bed and an separate office in my room! The location is great too, next to the 10 fwy and 202 and very close to the airport. I was here visiting accounts in Scotsdale, Tempe, Gilbert and Phoenix area and this place in centrally located at those locations. I booked the room with a 3rd party website and I was able to get a great deal, 40% off their cheapest rate on Radisson's website.",positive
"This was absolutely the best value for many reasons, when we chose it last weekend.... Walking distance to light rail, convenient central location for my friends catching spring training games in PHX and elsewhere.... But then it failed in the free wifi department. We were all getting together for our annual fantasy baseball draft and found that the internet service was dreadfully slow and unreliable at this hotel. Plus, I talked my friends out of paying more for the aloft because of its tiny rooms, but then found that the room they got at this hotel was also rather old-school small. So, if you're stopping in late at night on your way to catching a morning flight, then this is probably a great landing spot. Otherwise, you may want to consider trying one of the many other nearby properties.",negative
"When researching an economical yet comfortable place to stay in Phoenix, we settled on the Radisson. I will give it kudos on being quiet. The lobby, restaurant, hallways and rooms were nicely appointed, and not at all tacky. It looks like a remodel had been done recently. I have a scale for judging hotels that Hubs lovingly refers to as ""The 3 ts"": Thread count, Towels, and T.P. The Radisson passed the first T...the sheets were soft, and the down pillows meant I didn't have to bring my own from home (a plus in my book) But, the other 2 T's were a complete fail. Now, it was Valentine's Day weekend, and I didn't want to be a killjoy, but I found myself complaining about the towels the moment I got out of the shower....they were tiny, not at all absorbent, and dingy....I know that chlorine is a big environmental no-no....but, when I'm using a towel that Lord-only-knows where it's been...I like to know that a level of disinfecting (aka bleach) has ensued. I quickly caught myself, and told Hubs I was channeling my mother for a moment, but there was really nothing wrong. Then he took a shower and came out saying ""I don't think I've been in a gym in the country that had worse towels. I've stayed in flea-dives that had better towels""....so, I was NOT imagining things. I was afraid to use the wash cloth. My opinion of the hotel might be hindered by the fact that Herbalife was hosting some sort of weekend seminar there, and there were Herba-low-lifes crawling all over the place. I actually saw a man wearing a paisley tie with a MATCHING BASEBALL HAT.... And the 3rd T? Let's just say that, by the end of the 3rd night I had some serious chaffing issues.....sandpaper is softer than their toilet paper! Would I stay there again? Possibly....you couldn't beat our Hotel-dot-com rate ($80/night).... but I'd have to bring my own towels/TP.",negative
"Worst hotel I've ever ever ever been thru!!!!!! I checked in yesterday around 3pm for a 2 night stay all excited bringing all my things up to my room, getting organized, I jumped into the shower and immediately saw a cock roach which at first was no biggie. I let it go and decided to give the hotel a chance, after I unpacked and showered, I decided to lay in the bed and relax for 5 mins tops. I then start to notice that there was cock roaches EVERYWHERE. But not only cock roaches...tons of other creepy crawlies including BED BUGS!!!! Crawling all over me and the carpets. I couldn't believe my eyes. I immediately got all of my things outside of the hotel room so I wouldn't catch any bed bugs when I leave the facility. I load up my car and go straight to the front desk. At this time, it was around 4:15 pm I had only been in the hotel for an hour and 15 mins. I told the lady at the front desk that I just can't stay here. I got bit and there is bugs EVERYWHERE. I literally was almost in tears because I spent my last money in order to have a place to stay these 2 nights. The lady was not sympathetic at all for my experience. She was extremely rude and had her so called unprofessional ""manager"" go check the room in order to give me my money back. She comes back down and says no to give me the money back for last night but could refund the second night just because I used the shower and moved the bed sheets!!!!!! As if I was supposed to check into my room and just sit in the middle of the room and don't touch a thing till I know there is no bugs and then I can use my room. What does everyone do when they check into their hotel? They expect to check in to a clean room and start to relax and use what you paid for. I couldn't believe I lost $47 just for a shower and to be attacked by bugs. So not fair and really made me feel it. I don't understand how a hotel could be run like this. I will never be back and I am going to take my evidence and receipts to court and sue them for infestation and stealing money.",negative
"My mother in law stayed here for a week while she visited us. The last morning there she woke up covered in bed bug bites. She took pictures of the room, including the bed bugs and the stains on the mattresses. They did not offer to reimburse her or offer any sort of apology. This place is horrible. Do not go here.",negative
There is no word to describe how I felt when I walked in the room. It was awful. I felt like I was in a horror movie. I left right after I walked in the room.,negative
"If you travel with your dogs, this is nice enough place to land for a few nights. Fresh paint, and having everything in operating condition, would greatly improve the quality of the property.",negative
"An absolutely horrible experience. From the non-smoking rooms smelling like cigarettes and weed to the bed bugs that kept us up all night, I highly recommend finding some place else to stay. I will say that the staff here was very accommodating and did their best to help us, but the overall experience itself was terrible. Another issue was that we had changed rooms earlier in the day, and that night as we were getting ready for bed a man, with a key to our room, walks in. I felt unsafe that the hotel staff were so disorganized that they gave a man a key to a hotel room with 4 teenage girls in it. I appreciated their concern and willingness to help us change rooms and apologize for the inconveniences, but there is only so much that can actually be done with this.",negative
Staying in room 123 since 3/14. On 3/15 noticed 2 cockroaches but thought to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. Today came back from being gone all day and returned to a suitcase filled with cockroaches. Was told the hotel was booked so the could not move us and are only going to refund 1 night. So no choice but to stay in a room pumped full of chemicals that KILL?!?!? Health hazard! And only one night refund. This is totally unacceptable. DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!,negative
"So I recently stayed here with my family in early March not by choice but because it was the only hotel that had dates for when we were going . So the staff that I encountered were very super nice, the hotel how ever was not . It looked very dirty, rooms weren't always clean good, walls had stains and were not cleaned after we complained, pool was dirty . Hate to say it but there breakfast for 5 bucks was horrible food was not cooked well. The people that were staying in the hotel did not look like nice people at all . I will not be staying here at all, I rather pay more money for a better quality hotel",negative
"At the time of check-in, the front desk asked me $6 (two nights) for Room cleaning fee in addition to the full payment, which I paid thru Travelocity. Next day, I checked the Travelocity payment statement and came to know that I already paid the $6 in a different name, Property Fee. I showed the paper to them and got refund it. I wonder if it is their way of double charge. On the night, I found a cockroach in the bathroom. So I had to check every corner of the room, not to carry any cockroach to my home. At the time of check-in, they didn't return me my ID. Next morning, when I got there to mention of the double charge, they got me the ID. What if I didn't go to the front desk for the claim and drove all the day without the ID? The double charge, cockroach, unprofessional work skill, and water damaged bathroom wall with a water leaking noise... No recommend!",negative
"I've been here since August, spent a lot of money and was mistreated very badly by one employee named Michelle who I was told, was the assistant manager and head housekeeper. When I asked her to stop speaking to me in such a disrespectful manner and stop walking away, she retaliated against me and the manager did nothing about it when I complained. I tried not to air my grievances because I knew I would be there for quite a while. My reservations were mysteriously being cancelled causing me to book again, which they said I was double booked, ultimately messing up my credit card funds and making it seem like I wasn't paying or couldn't afford to pay. The room flooded, due to a toilet overflow above me, for hours... It was so so bad while I that I had to replace over $600 worth of items. This also caused havoc to my budget. I was humiliated in front of staff and customers On a weekly basis about the hotel bill, which ultimately was not my mistakes but was corrected without an apology. I can't understand why I cannot be reimbursed in a timely fashion for my losses in the flood, however, they can stand outside the door requesting their money that as a result of their mistakes. I am checking out today, even though I had a few weeks left for my business assignments. I can no longer tolerate the humiliation. Hotels.Com has records as well as I do, about the many times I have called in for corrections to be made. I leave, on business, for days at a time and should not have to come back to nonsense every week. I found others who have had bad experiences with Michelle the housekeeper who she either discriminated against or has verbally lashed out at them and also slams doors in their faces. I have video recordings and sound recordings of her disrespect and mistreatment of myself and the others that she slammed the door in their faces. I, and others who have encountered similar issues at the Ramada Tempe near ASU in Tempe Arizona, will be pursuing a lawsuit for discrimination and retaliation. Noone should have to endure such treatment from anyone.",negative
"Here for a 9 day baseball tournament. This place is a pig stie! Smoke odor (no more rooms available), paint peeling large chips in bathroom, towels not clean, cig butts on the grounds, pool is gross. Sub-standard in every functional category, except the staff are pleasant. Will be transferring to nicer place today. Management clearly cheap on maintenance, don't care about cleanliness. A black mark on the Ramada brand. Another lesson in 'get what you pay for'. Jeezz!!...as I'm typing this in the dark at 6am in my bed, a moth or bug flltters across my face as I frantically swipe it away! 'Nuf said.",negative
"This was the most embarrassing, disgusting and most horrible room I've ever had! In town 4 days for a baseball tournament my girlfriend and I decided to stay at this place. It seemed like a good central location between ballparks and it was priced well. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and friendly and got me checked in pretty quick. This was our fist ""vacation"" away together. As soon as we walked in the room she could immediately smell cigarette smoke in a non smoking room. Then after using the restroom my girlfriend found that the water wasn't working. So I called the front desk and she says that she forgot to inform me the the water would be off for up to 4 hours. There were cockroaches crawling around everywhere and the AC smelled like something was burning. But somehow we stuck it out for 2 days, being that we were out of the room for most of day 2. But on day 3, the cherry on top, I was getting ready to iron my shirt when I felt a lump in the lining of the ironing board. And Lord and behold (Johnjay & Rich reference), I pull the liner back and it's a CRACKPIPE!!!! I immediately called the front desk and let them know and left. I travel to Arizona every year and I will never stay here again and think twice about booking at Ramada in the future.",negative
"Disgusting! Upon checking in the clerk had a hard time figuring out what room we reserved. Gave us our key and states ""hold on, I gave you the key to a room throat is already occupied"" OMG I should of ran right then. Arrive to our room which was nonsmoking and clearly smelled like smoke. Couldn't sleep all night for I had the heebie jeebies that if I turned off the lights I would be attacked by roaches. Parking extremely dark and scary. Was looking for a cheap last minute room for a spring training game. Get what you pay for.",negative
This place is horrible first off the RUDEST STAFF EVER tweakers knocking on our door. People actually living in this hotel cats in the windows it's just gross. Bathroom door was to big for the frame wouldn't even shut. They wanted $100 deposit but yet has tweakers and homeless people all over the place. The room stunk we could even last a hour here called Hotwire for refund,negative
"Disgusting... Beyond disgusting! Pulling into the parking lot, the hotel looked decent in the front. While walking into the main office area to check in you could smell the odor of cat urine. My boyfriend and I continued to check in. After getting the room keys we were advised by the nice gentleman at the front counter we had to walk to the back of the building through a gate door and go up the stairs to the 2nd floor. While walking along side the building there was a lot of trash which I didn't really give no mind to. Upon walking through a locked key card door into the foyer it was a total different atmosphere. It looked like a run down building that had been abandoned! Tiles were missing out of the walk way and piled in the corner. There were splash puddles from some type of liquid being spilled and dried up with tons of dirt. Walking a little further down to head up the stair case there was a massive hole in the side of the building. People (drug addicts/ prostitutes) were standing in door ways staring at us as we made our way looking for our room number. Which made my self as a female extremely uncomfortable! We find our room and as soon as we walked in there was the odor of urine again, so strong it made me feel sick to my stomach! No way we were leaving the door open to air it out. I wanted to lock my self inside a soon as possible! We both put our stuff down and look around. The main room looked decent. We walked into the sleeping area and noticed multiple things, a hole in the door (someone punched it), broken/ dirty tile near the sink area, closet mirror door was almost impossible to open, the bathroom has dirt spots on the walls, the toilet seat had marks on it as it has NEVER been changed since the room was built. Booked a 6 day stay but only stayed 5, due to a planned trip to Cali.-- First night Wednesday- We dismissed all of it because we were exhausted. As we are about to get into the bed I noticed there is a red spot on the inside sheet. I pull back the blanket and there were LARGE blood pots on the sheet! How in the hell does someone make a bed with white sheets and not see FRESH LARGE RED BLOOD SPOTS. I was furious! He calls the front desk and all they could say is they can give us new sheets or move our room. He ended up hanging up the phone, the person he spoke with sounded as if we acknowledging this disgusting incident was our fault. We ended up removing most of the bedding. second night Thursday- bedding was changed Third night Friday- bedding was NOT changed. no new towels Left for 1 night for cali- Saturday Fourth night Sunday- bedding was changed Fifth night Monday- bedding was NOT changed. no new towels Sixth day Tuesday we checked out. I will never stay at this hotel or recommend EVER!!!",negative
This is the most disgusting place ever not only are they thieves by stealing my deposit there are nothing but drug addicts there while we were there three different men approached my daughter asking her if she wanted drugs then asked if she wanted to make some money the rooms are awful there are cigerette burns all over the place there was blood on the ceiling and there are bed bugs my advice is to pay a couple more dollars and stay at the motel6 across the street this place should be condemned,negative
"Truly strange place. Branded as a Ramada. Must have been built in the 70's. Everything is on it's own level. My suite looked like it had been used 10,000 times. At what point does the room amortize its cost? The bathroom floor was as hot as asphalt in the midday sun. Why? Had to put down wet towels. My feet still hurt. Right outside the lobby smelled like urine. However, okay internet and dreamy bed for me. Nice hosts/check in. Do not get the breakfast.",negative
"The room was spacious. But as for no smoking, it smelled like it was occupied by chainsmokers. The people coming in and out of the hotel gave me the urge to lock and latch my door upon entering. The grounds were dirty and I was done with the place long before checkout.",negative
The hotel is great except for they like to double charge and triple charge your credit card and if you pay cash they will still charge your credit card and some occasions and then you will not have proof that you had paid cash because they never give receipts I give this warning if you are a cash paying customer make sure to get a receipt for a cash payment because somebody that works there is stealing money they did it to me during my two week stay on three separate occasions and alwaysalways book online,negative
"So It is 1:00 am and I am writing this review while still at Ramada Inn. Here is my stay at Ramada Inn, Tempe Az. I book my stay on Hotels.com at the last minute due to plan changes. I gave my credit card number to hold the room. Upon check in they asked for my card again to swipe. Well I ended up having two charges to my credit card. The night clerk was of no help. He said I had to wait until the General Manager arrived the next morning. I arrived late at 1:00 am and when I noticed the charges I called my credit card company to confirm. So now it is 2:00 am and trying to get all the information so I can present it to the General Manager. Upon inspection of the room, there is aluminum foil wrapped around the smoke detector. I asked for a non smoking room and of course it smelled like smoke. There were stains of unknown origin on the comforter. Day 2, I went to the office and gave the General Manager the approval codes to both chargers and she was helpful and had one of them removed. I explained to her what the room inspection provided and she apologized and sent the housekeeper over to get the comforter. They tried to be accommodating, but there is not much they could do. Now when I arrived early in the morning I did not notice there were 10 kids yes I said 10 in the room above me. Maybe by 2 am they were sound asleep. But, it started about 3 pm today where the jumping and noise was so bad, it literally knocked plaster off the ceiling and made a crack in the ceiling. I reported it to the office and they called and went in person to request to keep the noise down. Well it is now 1 am the next morning and I am still awake. Why you ask? Because with 10 kids there is no keeping it down and I stay awake listening to chairs being rolled across the floor and pouncing like they are playing hopscotch. I am going to the office at check out and request a full refund. Let's see what happens.",negative
I booked a room through Hotels Tonight and the stay was perfect. The manager was friendly and accommodating. I told him I was in a car accident earlier in the day and had to stay the night and he made sure I had a quiet room away from the freeway. He also told me about the hot tub and the fitness center. My stay included breakfast and it was perfect for a Saturday morning. There's also a great Waffle House next to the hotel.,positive
"If you want to stay at a place with the following this is the perfect hotel for you: *wifi that goes in and out ""depending on how many people are using it"" *lumpy pillows *holes in your towels *staff that doesn't care didn't even ask how my stay was when I checked out (guess y'all don't want my repeat business as I would be staying here two weeks out of the month but not after this experience) *a gym with a broken treadmill (despite expressing this it was never fixed during my week here) *broken drink dispensers at complimentary breakfast",negative
"The front desk staff was friendly and that's all I can say that is good about this hotel. There is a gentlemen's club in front of this hotel and random people hanging around the parking lot. We got to our room and the complimentary toiletries were used! We pulled back the blankets and it was obvious it was not recently made.... mostly because of the pubic hairs on the sheets! When we called the front desk about the room, there was a very rude housekeeping supervisor who came to inspect the room. She could not care less and only offered to change our sheets. We got a refund and high tailed it out of this place.",negative
"10/07/17 @830pm The colored, toothless man at the front desk on the weekends is probably the rudest person I have ever come across. He has no customer service skills and when I went to the front desk because I had no clean towels, I kindly asked him for some and he came out with two hand towels and told me that was all he had. He proceeded to cuss at me telling me he doesn't give a f*** about what I needed and that he was going to call the police on me for supposedly threatening him because I said he was lucky my husband wasn't with me while he was cussing and yelling at me. Hopefully he loses his job for acting like such an asshole. He refused to tell me his name but I am sure when I speak to his manager in the morning they will know exactly who I am talking about. Also, the room was not clean upon arrival- there was a breathe right nose strip stuck to the counter and even after I called the front desk to let them know, they still didn't clean the room.",negative
"How is this place in business? Right when you walk in the smell of cigarettes and depression hits your face like nothing I've ever experienced. There's a little filthy kitchen, with burn marks. The bathroom toilet had little poop stains and I guarantee that someone got their kidney out on left for dead in that tub. The sink was decorated with pubic hair. The outlets sigh just look at the pictures. I didn't even sit on the bed because I like not having an STD. Checked out after 5 min of probably getting second hand smoke.",negative

"My family and I stayed here for one night only and glad it was only for one night! Our shower did not work, barely a trickle. When I called the front desk they said ""you need to pull it sir"", I think I know how to work a shower! When I asked to have maintenance service our room before we checked out, the front desk said it could be between one to two hours, by that time checkout would have happened. We ended up using a washcloth from the sink to bathe ourselves. The best part about my stay was the beds were comfortable and bedding was clean, but the floor needs major shampooing! Breakfast would have been good if they kept it stocked up. They had gravy, but not biscuits and bagels, but no cream cheese. Not sure if they ran out of food at 7 am on a weekday? Also, they are located directly in back of a strip club so you get to see all the interesting drunk people late at night walking around the parking lot.",negative
Good news truck drivers you can park in parking lot without getting a room let your truck run all nite to piss off the people paid for a room and management is to busy smoking weed to worry about it. Enjoy!!!!,negative
"I honestly don't even know where to say about this place.... First of all when you pull up here it's behind a gentleman's club (strip club). After you get past that you pull up the the front desk area and there are people hanging all over the balconies and random people just sitting on the sidewalk. I immediately felt very unsafe to be honest. While checking in, the lobby felt very small and smelled like smoke. It was not pleasant. We got to our room and it was decorated decently and didn't smell too bad. We noticed the pillows were literally half the size of a normal pillow...kind of odd and not functional if you ask me. Here's where it got bad. Around 11:30pm, motorcycles were reving their bikes right in front of our room and swear they had to have been making laps, blasting music as loud as possible. This lasted until 3am. It was awful. Every time we fought they were done, they came around again. They manager assured me that the parking lot was monitored due to the location. However, that had to have been a lie. I don't know who in their right mind would have let someone do that. It was a miserable experience, we will NEVER stay here again!",negative
"Terrible stay for 5 days huge patch in shower not painted, bathroom sink water lines hooked up backwards, three times we had to get new key cards for room either one or both would stop working front desk one person gave one reason when next customer came up with same problem they gave another story, house keeping only made the beds no coffee or condiments for coffee and didn't empty the filters. I had to go ask when they were working other rooms, pool area dirty unswept. No towels out for use at the pool. Hot tub extremely out of balance with PH and burnt your eyes if you turned the jets on. Breakfast Lady there was over whelmed our first day there wasn't anything out except empty trays at 7 am it wasn't much better the next 4 days . Breakfast lady shared her personal problems with customers and kept apologizing for not being prepared any day that we were there. Breakfast area very poorly arranged for convenience of guests. All of the common guest areas outside garbage cans were not dumped daily and were overflowing. The new manager gave us a discount of $50 off a 1000.00 plus bill and a possible next stay voucher for 1 night. Why put yourself through all of that again when you came to vacation? the hotel seems run down I won't stay there again it's a total mess.",negative
"If I could give this hotel zero stars I would. But yelp makes you star. This hotel was a sleaze fest. Lets set the scene shall we, upon arrival, my boyfriend and I immediately say.. Uhoh... We go inside and check in and the gentleman at the front desk was very nice, then he said "" if you wanna park your car outside your window just to keep an eye on it, that's cool"" were thinking oh sh+* we actually need to watch our car if we stay here!? Then he answers the phone and its a call about bed bugs from an existing occupant. Gross. Then he tells the owner, there are bed bugs in a lot of rooms. I don't think he thought we could hear him. We could. At this point we should have walked away. But we were trying to be good sports and go with what we had already booked. We get into our room and its gross. Huge but gross. I literally drive to target and purchase Clorox wipes, wet wipes, hand sanitizer and ear plugs. After cleaning all of the surfaces at 3pm. We left.. Returning that night for sleep, There were ""escorts"" in and out all night. Girls on cell phones in fights with their ""baby daddy"" ""POS husband/boyfriend/girlfriend"" People outside of our window at 1,2,3,4am talking as loud as possible. Someone was banging on our door at 3am and when I got up they were gone. We had stains on our sheets and roaches in our room. I did not want to get in the bed for fear of bed bugs. Sure enough the room next to us was infested with bed bugs. Our second night here my boyfriend and I were honestly contemplating going to target to purchase an air mattress some pillows and a blanket and sleeping on the floor in the back of his shop in old town. That's how bad it was. We ultimately decided to just bite the bullet since we had already paid and went back. Upon our return to our hotel, we were pulled over and questioned by the Tempe Police Department. I was told that they see a lot of illegal activity coming in and out of this hotel and they just wanted to spot check. The TEMPE POLICE DEPARTMENT was great and once I was informed that they circle the parking lot almost every hour, I felt a little bit safe. I finally slept that night because of my encounter with the police. The next morning, it took over an hour to get checked out because the front desk manager on duty forgot to put her makeup on and was sitting outside in her car doing said makeup. So we just waited until she thought she was ""ready"" to check us out. Run as fast as you can from this property! What they don't tell you until you get there is that this is a privately owned hotel doing business as Ramada inn. So it's not a Ramada and it has no standards. Save yourself the discomfort and hassle, book somewhere else. Its worth the extra money to go elsewhere. Honestly unless you're in the market for drugs and hookers, steer clear.",negative
"We booked this hotel online on our most recent trip to Arizona. We flew in and knew we wanted to stay overnight in the Phoenix area before heading to Sedona the next day. The price was great, everything was extremely clean and the hotel staff were polite. The only complaint I had and I guess it's not a true complaint but an observation, I did not like the idea of being behind gentlemen's club. I did not witness anything suspicious but it did cause me concern when I first pulled in. We went to bed kind of early due to traveling all day so I wasn't up late at night to see anything suspicious. But I had no problem with that. It's close to a lot of great restaurants, shopping and fun activities.",positive
"Awesome rate, excellent location, beautifully remodeled rooms, clean pool and sparkling spa, extremely friendly staff. Well done Ramada.",positive
"Room was incredibly dirty, the floor looked like it had blood smeared on it we used a bed sheet to be able to walk on it . Yeah the strip club was right next to it so who knows what type of griminess has stayed in that room!!, my fianc√© and i couldn't even have a proper shower the tub was filthy!, it looked like someone half-assed bleached it, it was awful. We are from out of state so i don't know what it was but the staff was incredibly rude! and socially awkward. We got in late at 10 pm and asked if there was a place to grab to eat and they just told us that ""everything is closed and in- n- out( popular west coast burger joint) closed at 10"", ANYONE WHO LIVES in the west coast knows that in-n out usually closes at 1:30am he said he had definitely had been to it before so what GIVES!!!????, RUDE!!! no directions no suggestions. Lastly at check out everything was okay except they pull an extra charge /fee on us!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD !!!!??, we kindly asked why there was an extra fee and we where met with rudeness again by this girl! What in the world!!!!!????. Never again! we could have put up with the dirty room and even the rude desk people but to be CHARGED EXTRA really broke the camels back NEVER AGAIN!!!",negative
"Ok price, good breakfast but trash everywhere and bathroom reeked of urine. I finally had to pour water and shampoo on my floors for housekeeping to clean the floors. Walk out to trash blocking the stairs I had to walk past coming and going. I would not stay again. My 3 day stay was 3 days too long. Front staff Luis was an awesome gem.",negative
"Found them on Kayak and don't regret. Booking was online in less than 2 minutes, checking in was fast too. Front desk is helpful and friendly. Room was clean, smell and mold free. All necessities are there - cable TV, WiFi Internet, pool, jacuzzi, and gym. Price is reasonable too.",positive
"Stayed here on a Sunday and Monday in June. Very reasonably priced. The pool is average. The room was upgraded with modern furniture. AC worked excellent. Beds were comfortable. Sheets were clean. Complimentary breakfast was surprisingly pretty good. No smell of smoke in the room. Day shift staff was incredibly nice, but the third shift guy was terrible. Yes, it is ""hidden"" behind a Gentlemans club but in my three days/two nights I didn't see any suspicious activity. Plenty of food options nearby. Very accessible to the freeway. I will try to stay here again when I go for Spring Training.",positive
"Wow - very impressed. We got one of the coupon books and got the room for $54.95 bucks! The place has just been renovated, they serve a hot breakfast + usual cereal, muffins & fruit. The best part is that the pool and hot tub do not have limited hours - so as long as you are quiet - no worries about a midnight swim and hot tub. It was very nice after a long day of driving. There is also a small gym - very basic. Mostly clean. The yoga mats were dirty - so bring your own or Clorox wipes! But hey - new gym equiptment, ex resize ball, a water cooler and a TV. Note - there is a strip club (calls the gentlemen's club) right before it but the clerk at the front desk said that they have security and both lots are constantly monitored. Staff was very friendly and helpful. This was a better deal than places we have stayed at w 4 stars and over double the price.",positive
"Clean rooms, helpful staff, that's all I ask for out of a Hotel......the negative: there's a Gentleman's Club(strip club) in front of the Hotel, if you can look past that, it's ok......we had a nice stay",positive
"I have been here in the past mostly work trips out this way. But this place has a major face lift, the rooms are clean comfy the showers are great flat screen tv excellent for connecting you PS3 or other gaming console. Breakfast is fresh n filling good to start your day. I recommend you stay here if in town or just passing through. As always enjoy and be kind",positive
"Visa gift card, free night stay, discount!?Wondering if that's what the management is handing out for good reviews. The area is odd to say the least. A lot of transients walking through the open parking lot 0.o at all hours. Room is clean but it has an awful stench and it's supposed to be smoke free. It doesn't smell like smoke it smells like mold or mildew. I tried spraying the room with body spray thinking it was temporary but that's not the case. The entrance is just one way! How inconvenient on such a busy street, lets hope you're not in hurry to get out or come back to your smelly room. I'm to stay another night but that's NOT going to happen. Book at your own risk!",negative
"Great Service, we were offered water as soon as we got to the hotel. Such a nice touch. Modern decor, very nice hotel for the price. Beds were comfortable, rooms were very nice. Pool was great especially for the weather. Breakfast was good, came with bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, cereal, etc. (buffet style) Overall I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone. Everything went smoothly.",positive
"Not the worst hotel. Comfortable bed with a decent TV. The staff are rude and nosy. We were given a ridiculous fine because we didn't read what we signed carefully. Watch out. Location is great right by the mall and highways. Although, at night it can be noisy and creepy because it is literally RIGHT BEHIND a strip club. We stayed 7 nights and every day the housekeeping came at a different time..got woke up as early 9:am which is rough if you plan on going out all night. Housekeeping does not clean the floors or toilets they pretty much do the bare minimum...The hotel itself isn't bad at all....the staff is just bad.",negative
"I booked online in the summer direct on their website and got an excellent rate (under $50) for one of the cleanest and nicest hotels I have stayed at in a long time. I highly recommend this as a luxury stay for a reasonable/cheap price, next to AZ Mills Mall, golf courses, excellent restaurants, and lots of other sights. Not far from ASU, easy access to I-10, Rt. 60, and the 101. Great stay, next time I'll stay here longer!",positive
Absolutely awesome. They just went through a renovation. Completely gutted everything. The check in was effortless. The easiest check in I have ever experienced. The room was gorgeous. Brand new everything. Granite countertops in the bathroom. The most wonderful bed. I wanted to take it home with me! This is the best motel find we have found to date. You will not be disappointed when you stay here.,positive
"I reserved this hotel for a short stay and I am very disappointed with everything around here. I booked it 5 days before and when I came here to check in, the front desk guy said my room is already occupied. After a angry conversation I end up in handicapped room.",negative
My wife and I stayed here during our Spring Training trip. This place is a little run down but good enough for spending a few days. Close to Diablo stadium. The reason this is 3 instead of 4 stars is housekeeping. Our room wasn't ready until after 4 pm and each day housekeeping left a little to be desired.,negative
"This has to rate one of the worst motels I've stayed at. I stayed here with my daughters' for a gymnastics meet in January 2012. Upon entering our room, I was immediately disappointed. After my daughter took a shower I had to call the front desk to get more ""towels"". The guy told me I had to come and get them myself! What? He handed me two ""towels"" and I looked at him and laughed. I think he was getting them from the car wash pile. Seriously, they were like small, used, hard, scratchy towels. I had to get a few more to do the job. There was a party going on upstairs and they didn't quiet down until after midnight. The place was dingy and dirty. I was afraid to touch anything and I couldn't wait to leave. I booked it for the free wifi. Unfortunately, the wifi couldn't reach us at the back side of the hotel. I even tried the ""porch"" and stairs. I ended up needing to stay an additional night and was not about to stay there again! It's on my list of ""never agains"".",negative
"NEVER AGAIN! Decor very dated. Towels were dingy. Outdoor corridors needed a good hosing. Pool area disgusting (dirty). Cigarette butts everywhere. Ignored to use pol at the Arizona Grand...tried to save a few bucks, but was thoroughly disappointed. Wi-Fi worked intermittently. Small tv, dis not swivel. Phone cord TAPED with scotch tape.",negative
"This place rates as a decent ""place to park your carcass,"" but outside of that, it doesn't have many redeeming qualities. It is an older hotel located behind a strip club. The card readers in the door locks barely work. It took me a dozen tries just to get into my room. The breakfast is mediocre at best. But thankfully there's a Waffle House next door, so don't even bother with the stale pastries and cereal. If I had to spend more than eight hours in this hotel (and seven of those sleeping) I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. But as a place simply to spend the night, it'll suffice.",negative
"The rooms were surprisingly clean and newly remodeled. The bed was super comfy, shower pressure was excellent and both Ashleys at the front desk were super nice.",positive
"Worst WiFi a hotel has to offer. Community network (password is ""hotspot"") is shit and not worth the trouble of connecting to. If you want a hotel with decent wifi, go anywhere but Ramada.",negative
"Ramada Urbana/Champaign 902 W. Killarney St. Urbana, IL. 61801 Date: April 8, 2017 The weekend of April 7-9th, I planned to visit my daughter for Moms Weekend at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign. I had a reservation scheduled for Friday, April 7 for a one-night stay for $192.09 at the Ramada Hotel. On Saturday April 8, I noticed I received two withdrawals from my bank account totaling $384.18 via the Ramada. I immediately went down to the front desk to inquire about the charges. A woman named Crystal was on duty at the time. I asked why there was an extra charge of $192.09 to my account. She vaguely explained that it was a hold on my account. Therefore, I continued to inquire about the additional charges applied to my bank account. In an aggressive manner, Crystal replied, ""Look! I don't get what you don't understand about what I'm saying!"" While speaking, she is gesturing her finger to her forehead. I said, ""I need to speak to your manager immediately!"" Crystal responded, ""She aint here!"" I let her know her behavior was completely unprofessional and rude. She began to point her pen in my face yelling at me to leave the hotel. She yelled this several times. Keep in mind; this is Moms weekend, during the hotel's breakfast hours, so there were plenty of parents sitting feet away from the front desk. I told her that I am not going anywhere. I am a paying customer and I have every right to be here! She became extremely aggressive and jumped out of her seat and lunged out at me in a threatening manner over the desk. I let her know that I was going to call the police. Then she stated that she would call the police. I told her please do, because you are the aggressor in this situation, she placed the phone down. I was extremely humiliated and embarrassed by the way I was being treated. Another employee named Shade (Shae), stepped in to diffuse the situation. She calmly stood in front of me and said to please speak directly to her and not to her co-worker. She showed me a plaque with the hotel's policy regarding the debit hold. I thanked her for showing patience in explaining the policy with clarity. All while I was speaking with Shae, Crystal was belligerent! She told me to shut-up several times and continued yelling for me to leave the hotel. Shae turned around towards her and said that it is not professional or appropriate for her to speak with a customer in that manner. Crystal proceeded to yell, ""Don't tell me what to do! You need to leave work now!"" Shae told her not to speak to her that way and she walked to the breakfast area. Crystal left the front desk and followed Shae to the breakfast area. Shae began to yell get your finger out of my face and leave me alone (reminder: parents are still eating breakfast in this same area). Not only was Crystal behaving aggressively with a customer but with a co-worker as well. I have NEVER experienced such a display of ignorance, incompetence, and unprofessionalism. As a paying customer, I am appalled and disgusted by the way I was treated! I have been a teacher for the past 17 years. I work in the field of helping others and deal with disgruntled parents quite often. If I EVER behaved in this manner with a parent, I would immediately be terminated! As a professional, I take offense to the disrespect and the lack of humanity that was demonstrated by your employee, towards me as a patron to your establishment. I spoke with Shae before leaving the hotel. I asked if she could check me out to alleviate any further confrontations with Crystal. Shae apologized profusely for her co-worker's behavior. She explained that the Ramada is a wonderful hotel and hope this incident does not deter me from continuing to visit. She stated that she loves her job and this is not usually, how business is handled at the hotel. If it was not for this young woman working on this particular day, I do not know how things would have turned out. Shae was a constant professional. She conducted herself in a way that would make any supervisor/manager appreciate having her on their team. Despite all of the drama that took place, I thought the hotel was very nice. The room was clean and cozy. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Overall, it was nice stay. It is just unfortunate that an inept person is a representation of such a reputable establishment. Hope no other customers will be subject to her foolishness ever again.",negative
Got here around midnight had two rooms booked for two nights (possibly three). Upgraded one to a jacuzzi suite. Finally get in room and last thing to unpack before enjoying the tub was the bathroom. Go into unpack and there's toilet paper in the tub. Yes it did look I used but still. Turn around and there is either blood or feces on the front of the sink. Call down stairs and she says we will have to move down stairs. Get husband up and repack. Ho downstairs get new key and unpack. Finally get in tub 1:30 their time and 2:30 my time. The silver cover to the drain starts floating around the tub. Not to mention the faucet labeled C is the hot and I scald my arm on the Spicket. Freezers froze over and drawers missing from frig. Not a very happy rewards member tonight! Ps if you stay in room 109 the faucets are mismarked,negative
"I stayed here 10 days ago. Some items came up missing- I am not sure if stolen or lost. I called the next day, three times over 24 hours and explained the situation and asked they check video and key card data. No one ever called back. I had corporate headquarters call them and even then Urbana never got back to me. If they won't return calls something is wrong. Go across the street, but avoid this Ramada.",negative
"I've been staying in this place for quiet awhile for work. Well I hit the last straw last night. Constant fridge/electrical problems. Ruined some food freezing 1/2 the times. 3/4 of the time the fridge don't work when entering the room. Well last night coworker woke up itching with bites. Most likely, fleas. Stayed at this hotel 30+ nights. I'd give this place 1 1/2. The only reason I gave the other half a star was cause I feel sorry for them. On second, thought. For not replacing the food they should of been responsible for replacing. My co-worker really appreciated a coupon offer also .",negative
Just adequate. Price and location attracted us but when when we registered a $50 deposit was required. What a surprise. Again just adequate.,negative
"Extremely rude staff. (Racist and homophobic, too). The front desk lady didn't even bother to say ""hi"" or ""welcome"" or anything. She didn't even make eye contact. I can still remember what she looks like: fat, ugly, white, and a face that makes me want to vomit. She lacked any manners or politeness. I will never come here again. And it's not just me, I noticed an African American man behind me who was waiting to get checked in, and the front-desk lady gave the same rude treatment to him as she gave to me just moments prior. What a racist b*tch. Next time I'm going from Memphis back to Chicago, I'm not staying here again. There's alot of other hotels here.",negative
"Booked reservation through hotels.com for under $60 so I had low expectation on quality, however I was sorely mistaken. This red roof inn was comparable to any other Hampton inn with the same room amenities. Fast check in and check out. Also seems like in a decent area unlike other hotels near Sky Harbor Int'l Airport. I will definitely stay at this location again when flying out of Phoenix airport.",positive
"I book a lot and to be honest this has been probably one of the worst types of services I've ever received . Let's point out what I liked since that's easier *at first the staff was very friendly . *the lobby was nice and they provided coffee and have a vending machine *parking is also very accessible and close to the hotel; no long walks Yeah that's prettt much it Hotel details I didn't like .. were the bathrooms although they are spacious seems like this building use to be for seniors and they remodeled the rooms but forgot to remodel the bathroom. It's very I was accused various times of smoking in my room even after they check the room every-time they came up . I was not even there for an hour when two people came to knock on my door and said we were smoking I let them come in and they noticed that we weren't .. he did something to the smoke alarm, said he would be back to fix the screen and came to do that and left us alone .Then the next day after calling me and kicking us out and attempting to charge ya a $200 fee-they came up to do a final inspection and just asked us to take our weed in the car,because it bother people . That's all they should have said the first time instead of harassing us, we gladly took it to the car . There should defiantly be a better protocol to how these things are dealt with,because we didn't smoke! there were no signs that stated any sort of restriction towards possessing medicated herb.We had every intention to respect people in that hotel and had an offsite designated area to smoke at . Phoenix is hot ASF! Our herb would light itself ...just saying customer service and management protocol go along way . Never staying at any sort of red roof inn again .",negative
"This place and the staff made our stay so much better. Don't understand the bad ratings at all. The place is nice and clean and at a good price. These guys let us check in 2 hours earlier which was amazing because we had a tight schedule with a few events and we had our puppy and couldn't drive 2 hrs and miss these things. They did us a huge favor in doing that. Also we take our dog everywhere and this place is pet friendly without a pet charge and that's something you don't get anywhere else. The staff was friendly and was willing to give directions and recommendations the stay was comfortable, overall it's a good choice. Don't pay any mind to these negative reviews",positive
I tried to check in today the girl at the front desk told me that she couldn't rent to me because there was a note stating the room was trashed which is a lie there might have been garbage but that's it there was nothing else I think it was the manager that I told that my son was outside and some people told him that there was a guy on the 2 floor that was a pimp so I told a manager that and he didn't seem to concerned about it so I think it was him because I might b cutting into his money this is total bull shit and If it was trashed I want to see pics,negative
"For a budget hotel, our stay here was pretty decent. We got a last minute booking/promo through a third party and check-in was very painless and smooth. We got a room on the top floor and everything was clean for the most part. Service was good in terms of our interaction with the staff. Minus one star because they did not give us any shampoo except for one measly small bar soap to wash our hands. We normally don't being shampoo when staying at a hotel because we know they provide that for us but it was not the case here. The hotel is sort of in the middle of nowhere but it's very close to the Sky Harbor airport (roughly 12 minutes away) and there are various hotels along that street.",positive
"HORRIBLE, thin, springy, cheap mattresses. Awful, hard, pancake-like pillows. Floors so covered with chunks of...?? that we had to call the maid to come down and vacuum as soon as we arrived. And the water... the water was so GROSS and SLIMY from over-softening that it was impossible to tell if I even got the soap off, and I was left feeling like a grease slick. The only reason I've even given two stars here is that it's in a decent location & proximity to the airport, & they accept dogs. Other than that, it just LOOKS nice in pictures.",negative
"Had to wait ten minutes for a person to check in. Not due to a line but due to laziness on workers. Been at this hotel before in other places and made the mistake of priceline and had this crappy place again. Never clean, horrible service, always outdated, and always rude staff.",negative
The room was nice & spacious but our floor was a bit noisy. The reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of the front desk attendant Nora was very kind and helpful. She lights up the entrance with her outgoing personality. Thank you Nora for your help and for making us smile!,positive
Before I booked my stay at this location I did notice a few negative Yelp reviews. Including the one about the bed bugs about a year ago. But I decided to stay at this location while visiting Arizona for a family members graduation anyway. Most hotels are hyper vigilant after bed bug complaints are made public so I took a chance and it was worth it. The cost for the two nights that I stayed was extremely low and I experience no negative issues at all during my stay. I could also tell that there were trace of bed bugs in my room (If you travel often it is good to learn how to spot the signs). The staff was pleasant and my room comfortable. I would definitely stay again if I'm ever in the area.,positive
"Staff was friendly, and rooms are clean. There was a girl named Cecilia, front desk, she was super nice and went out of her way to print out some tickets for me when their wifi went down. Close to Tempe/Mill. The vending machines take both cash and cards so that was a good thing.",positive
Amazing service and very comfortable sheets and blankets. Staff was calm and took care of things with a smile even when they were hard things to deal with. Deffinatley recommend this hotel for the service.,positive
"Service was great, Santiago or Sergio (I can't remember) even asked us if we wanted a first or second floor room. Great hotel, simple and clean. And really cheap. I would definitely come back again and again.",positive
"Friendly staff! super cheap price ($65 after tax) for king size no smoking on a Thursday night. Such a great deal! I love how there is no charge for your first pet. My husband, myself, and our dog needed a place to rest for the night while passing through Arizona. The room looks clean and the floors are hardwood. Overall I am very pleased and will be coming again. One star was taken off bc I believe the room smelled like past guests smoked in this non smoking room.",positive
"Very fair priced, very clean, and I really like the area. Staff has always been very helpful, I'm not sure if they have a free breakfast or not but as far as I know they do not. Also a pet friendly hotel if that is a concern of yours.",positive
"For $60 a night through Expedia this place is pretty good. The room is super spacious and includes a full ironing board with iron, coffee maker, mini fridge, microwave and flat screen tv. The bed isn't super comfortable but it's huge which is nice. It's also in a great central location and the front desk lady is super friendly. I'm sure I'll be returning soon for any other stays in Arizona.",positive
"Great quality! We were on a 12 hour road trip and needed a quick place for the family to rest before finishing up the trip the next day, they booked us fast and at a great price of $47 :) really enjoyed the room, very clean and comfy! I would stay again!",positive
"I can say I'm a regular customer here. It's inexpensive, clean enough to be acceptable, and near everything I'd like to be at. The staff is really cool and I have had no problems with em. Polite and helpful is a plus which they displayed. I would suggest to book the room through ""hotel.com"". You'll get a better price that way. No continental breakfast but I can manage. Only problem is the air conditioners are weak or they added something to them to govern the output to use less electricity wattage. That's my guess but cmon it's PHOENIX ARIZONA and it's known to be a hot mofo over here so give us COLD AIR! BE COOL FOOL! Lmao overall i keep coming back, that tells you something right thur!",negative
"Good price and location, they were also accommodating for us needing to stay another day. The only thing I would have liked, which it stated clearly was complementary breakfast, but it states that isn't something they provide. For what you get, it is well priced, good location, and clean rooms.",positive
"This hotel is good for the price you pay.. It's not the best or amazing but it's not the worse. Room was nice and clean, bed was okay, wasn't too noisy, and the bathroom was clean. The bad thing about this hotel was the fishy people out in the parking lot.",negative
"I've become a bit of an expert in Red Roof Inn's traveling around the U.S. on a 7-month road trip with my dog. This was one of my favorites of the whole trip, and also one of the lowest priced, which seems contradictory, but I'm not complaining! lol It was clean, quiet, housekeeping was awesome and great at their jobs, which is becoming harder to find, front desk staff was friendly and efficient, grounds were clean and well-maintained, room was spacious and comfortable. Location was very convenient. Everything worked, looked great, outlets were easy to access, bed was super comfy. Just awesome in every way. I have 6 more weeks left of my road trip, while I photograph client's dogs up the west coast back to Seattle, and I so wish I could bring this Red Roof Inn with me. I've only felt that way about a few properties on this trip (Dallas TX, Morrow GA, New Haven CT), so this says a lot. Stay here. You'll like it. :-)",positive
"I was visiting a handful of friends in the Phoenix/Tempe area. I generally just stay with friends but got a hotel room this time. I'll admit, I was going for no frills and CHEAP ....minus bed bugs. There are plenty of hotels in the area due to ASU and the Phoenix airport, so prices are wonderfully competitive. Read some reviews here and was skeptical, but seemed worth a try. Room: Upgraded for $5 per night to a king size bed. I had a mini fridge and microwave (wonderful for leftovers!) a single cup coffee machine, a table and chairs and a desk. The blanket was thin and I asked for another, but they worked. A/C, heater fan thing was a window unit but kept everything comfortable. Free WiFi and lot parking. Flat screen tv, dresser and super awkward 2 level corner desk. If you had taken that out you could have fit another full size bed! Was able to open my window a few inches for fresh air as well. A few stains here and there, but everything was pretty clean for an older building. Bathroom was unremarkable but, uh, got the job done. Had Pantene brand shampoo. Paid about $55 per night over a weekend (Fri-Sun). The people at the check in desk were friendly enough and the late night front desk guy even gave us walking directions to a convenience store after a night of bar hopping. Felt secure and housekeeping didn't pester us. Elevator was a little wobbly and old....we took the stairs half the time, the place is only 3 levels tall. Would stay here again and recommend it if you get a deal. Cab fare to downtown Tempe/ Mill street is about $8 each way (so think $20 round trip). Plenty of cabs, light rail and busses in the area (so no drunk driving excuses!) This is my first stay at a Red Roof ever and I am more than satisfied....I think having a mini fridge might even convince me to bump this up half a star. I've stayed at some nice hotels and this old little crappy building made me feel very at ease. Sometimes you'd rather have a wave hello at the front desk instead of a tuxedo man opening the door every time you glance inside.",positive
"Nice hotel if flying out, great 24 hour Mexican drive thru down broadway past circle k, reasonably priced, safe parking, clean room, clean bed.",positive
"Large, clean, comfortable, quiet...and SMOKY. The front desk clerk couldn't smell any smoke. To me, the air was blue with it and it kept getting worse. That and the internet barely worked and cut out even after an hour's worth of support desk calls. Why spend so much to remodel if you are not going to enforce your ""100% No Smoking Room"" advertisement?",negative
"A friend of mine visiting from California stayed here one weekend. I went to pick him up at his hotel room. It was the first time I've been to a Red Roof Inn and I wasn't impressed. The room was large, but it wasn't well appointed and very bland. The elevator didn't work very well, it ""stuttered"" and gave me a sense that you could get stuck between floors....not saying that it would do that, but it gave me that uneasy feeling. I asked him why he selected this place and he said it was because it was cheap. He didn't like the beds and didn't sleep well. For the traveler on a budget, it would probably work fine. Return Factor - 30%",negative
Stayed here for five days during a conference. Very clean!. Coffee always ready. The best part was the staff!! The front desk guy Cameron was great. Red Roof is very lucky to have such an efficient and hard working employee. If I had a business I would hire him to work for me.,positive
"No complaints about our stay here. Stayed two nights. We booked with Travelocity and were able to bring our dog with us at no additional charge--unheard of among hotels and we were so glad for that. Room was clean and recently renovated, bed plenty comfortable. Everything worked fine. The price was awesome, too. Super quiet location, too. We didn't get woken up by any noise, but the second night, just to be safe, we left the bathroom fan on all night (it makes just the right amount of background noise). The lady working the desk at night was an absolute SWEETHEART, too. She remembered my name and was super warm and friendly, besides being very professional. Great stay. For the price, location, and pet-friendliness, I'll be staying here again next time I visit Tempe.",positive
"I have now stayed here twice. Both were good experiences. Both times were were here for spring training. The hotel is perfect for what we are doing. We don't need a restaurant onsite, or a weight room. We just want a clean place to stay for a reasonable price. This place provides us with just that. Use you AAA card, you get about 10% off your stay, too. During spring training it was only about $70 a night for two beds. We booked three rooms at that price, as there were six of us. They do not do rollaway beds, FYI. If they did, we would have only needed two rooms, three people in each room, but whatever. The location is great for being close to downtown Tempe and Sky Harbor Airport, both about 5 minutes away. There isn't really anything you can walk to for anything. And I mean anything. No Circle K or fast food even. It is kind of like in a business park area, though it is next to a couple of other hotels. There is free wifi, which I used and I didn't have any issues. We will be back.",positive
"After a long flight from east coast, the Red Roof Inn saved the day. Arriving after midnight, we were greeted with a quick check-in and an extremely friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean and perfect for a one night stay...large and well-kept. Plenty of free parking and complimentary coffee in the lobby. They also have a pool which looked like heaven in the desert heat. The facilities looked perfectly maintained. Very good for an airport hotel.",positive
"Paid $49 for two full beds, not a bad price. Had a coffee maker and was pretty clean. Service was great, no problems. I recommend it if you're just staying a night or two, very close to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.",positive
"Ok. So it *is* a Red Roof Inn. The rooms could have been a bit cleaner, maybe re-done. There is no coffee maker in the room, but they have a great machine in the lobby just outside the elevator doors. They have anything from regular coffee to vanila lattes, I appreciated that :) The staff was WONDERFULL!! Especially Meesa...We were there for Spring training, It was happily no problem at all for us to check in late, and she was extremely helpful and polite our entire stay, reccommending places to eat, etc... She remembered our names (and those of other guests) quickly and was lots of fun to just talk with! Once we were a couple hours out of Tempe, I realized I had left my TENS unit at the hotel (it is an electro-stimulation device for pain control) It was brand new. I called the next day and spoke with Nora. She was superbly helpful, found the item and shipped it out to me quickly. Because of the location and the wonderful staff and the price, I would stay there again.",negative
"I really enjoyed this hotel. It is conveniently located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. There are so many restaurants, bars and activities to do within walking distance. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The amenities such as the gym and pool are well equipped. The continental breakfast was on point! The only issue I had was on the first night as there was a horrible noice coming from the 20th floor. This night was horrible and couldn't sleep but management moved me the next day. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel if you're staying in the Phoenix area.",positive
"I flew in to town early in the morning. They had a room ready for me at 8:30am! At checkout they were able to store my luggage for me until it was time to leave for the airport. Although I did not use the valet, that team was very friendly and helpful with any questions I had. The room cleaning team was helpful with extra towels and blankets. They even wrote little notes telling me to have an awesome day.",positive
"My stay at Residence Inn was nothing short of comfortable and satisfying. The rooms were modern and simple, not to mention a nice little kitchen. Not a kitchenette, but an actual kitchen complete with a stove, sink, refrigerator, utensils, pots/pans, and plates. To some, a kitchen would be pretty much useless, but it actually came in handy, especially when it came to reheating leftovers and keeping our beverages nice and cold. The bathroom was also modern and simple, but a little on the small side, especially the sink. I'd have to wait for my girlfriend to finish her thing before I could comfortably get ready for the day. Now the important part! The bed! It was plenty big and comfortable, but the pillows were a little too soft for my preference. The covers were just the right amount of thick. It kept us at the perfect temperature all night, which actually brings me to the next topic. The AC was a little too strong. The low was more like a medium, but below that was obviously the fan or turning it off altogether, neither of which was an option because the room would get warm pretty quickly. At the end of the day, being a little on the cold side is better than sweating bullets, but half a notch lower on low would have been perfect. There were a couple of interesting things in the shower though. First, when I turned the shower water to hot, I kept turning the handle to gauge how hot the water would get, but for some reason it made the lights in the bathroom flicker? Second, the shower door wouldn't stay closed, so sometimes the water would get the floor wet. It was mildly annoying because sometimes I would step on the soggy bathroom mat with socks on. Aside from the little gripes, everything was great. The staff was friendly, the hotel and the room was clean (thank god), and the complimentary breakfast was actually breakfast with typical breakfast fare rather than free donuts and coffee. If for whatever reason I find myself in Phoenix again, I would absolutely stay here again if the price is right.",positive
"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I got a studio with a King bed on the 15th floor. The couch came with a 2nd bed built into it and there was an extra pillow and blankets in the closet, we appreciated it very much. Also our view was very outstanding we got a view of TSR Arena and Chase Field. We went out and walked around there was so many restaurants, clubs, and coffee shops. The parking also wasn't bad, we were told it'd be $18 to park the vehicle for the night but in the morning it came out to $10 for about 12 hours or parking which isn't bad. The staff informed us that they had only been open for seven months. This place is very clean, is very secure, and they provide a delicious breakfast buffet. I strongly recommend this place I would like to stay here again.",positive
"Amazing rooms. Wonderful check in experience. However i ordered dinner their and the cashier was just absolutely hateful, slammed the food, told me how much it was and threw my change at me, did not greet me nor tell me thank you for my business was too busy trying to hurry up and mop to get out of their (obviously was close of her shift), as a marriot employee i expected better and i always stay late if need be without complaints or ever throw an attitude towards guests. Upon checkout i got the emailed folio to discover i was charged for the two $5 water bottles placed in the room, which i knew for a fact i did not touch them. I called and was transferred three times, managment did not believe me and put me on a long hold before informing me houskeeping and the front desk ""accidentally charged me"", and they would refund it and basically hung up. No apology. Nor no representation of the marrior LEARN standards, whether i stay on employee rate or not i expect good customer service especially coming from management, i did tell my managment about this experience as well as writing this review. Beside that you have a beautiful hotel- but i will not return.",negative
"Just checked out from this hotel and I couldn't be happier with my stay all the way around. Pros- GREAT price. Lots of extras for your money. Extremely clean. Good location- Starbucks, CVS and several places to eat are in walking distance. Awesome breakfast (one of the best I've had for free with my stay) that is free every morning between 6-9am. Eggs, sausage, bacon, tortillas, waffle maker, cereal, yogurt, bagels, croissants, toast, all kinds of juices and more. They give you Paul Mitchell shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion. Clean, Comfy bed. Space was maximized well in our room. We had a studio which came with a king size bed, kitchenette with a full size refrigerator, 2 burner stove, dishwasher, pots, pans, utensils, etc. we also had a couch, desk, and a mini bar with barstools. Modern and updated decor. Lastly, I want to make sure to mention the staff. From our first encounter with the valet guy to the time we checked out, every encounter with one of the employees was great. Absolute friendly staff they have there. Cons- In downtown area so all surrounding streets are one way only. Parking is $30 if you valet or $18 if you self park in the structure next store. I would absolutely stay here again!",positive
"I was going to be in Phoenix for 4 days, and I had to choose between the Residence Inn and Renaissance. I kept going back and forth, as I prefer full service hotels, but the idea of the extra space to lounge for an extended stay seemed enticing. I finally chose the Residence, and I'm very glad I did. The valet was always quick and helpful, and it was very convenient that I could text for my car. I used my friend's car all week, so we had a habit of taking the car in and out multiple times. Life tip - if you need in and out privileges in any city, ALWAYS valet. Yes valet may seem more expensive from the get-go, but I've never heard of a non-hotel owned parking garage that allows the option of leaving and going as you please. Plus, I'm low key lazy and I like being able to walk right outside with my car being there. When you walk in, you're greeted with an obviously new lobby. As the hotel has only been there for less than a year, everything is stylish and well kept. There are many places to sit should you need to have an early morning conference call. The front desk was always very helpful and welcoming from check-in to check-out. I booked a two queen studio, and I was very pleased with my room. I had a very nice view of Phoenix, as well as the extra space I was hoping for. The room was very clean all throughout my stay, and any request I had was swiftly completed. The hotel is conveniently located for Suns game; I was also able to walk to the Arizona Science Center in about 10 minutes. I really enjoyed the walk ability of the city, and the location of the hotel helped that immensely. When I return to Phoenix, I'm sure this will be my first choice.",positive
"My wife and I came to PHX to check out a concert and decided on this spot last minute because of its vicinity to the venue. Based on the pictures online, it looked like a pretty safe pick. We were not disappointed at all! The hotel is in a great place if you're going to a diamondback or suns game, plenty of restaurants and bars near by as well. The hotel itself is clean, contemporary and extremely comfortable. Free hot breakfast as well! Fair warning, parking will run you $18-30 depending on if you choose to park yourself or valet your vehicle. We'll be back for sure.",positive
"Tried to have our wedding ceremony here, went through the walk though process and loved the place and setting. Angela the event coordinator helping us said she was to get back to us the next day with pricing however did not do so until 3.5 weeks later. In order to get a response we had to send non stop emails as well as visits. When asked for Angela on site, I was told there was no one by that name who worked here or they are at lunch, BIG LIE. When finally getting a call back was insulted with lies to cover up laziness on their end. This place is not equipped to fully service Downtown Phoenix.",negative
"Ah, nothing like a brand new hotel! This place is pretty great and since it's new (and in Arizona) you pretty much have all the amenities to yourself! From the pool, fitness center, laundry room and free breakfast (sorry, Residents only folks), it's the gift that just keeps on giving. Residents (the people like myself that stay in the rooms that are studio apartments) get services like dry cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. You just fill out the grocery list and give it to the concierge then within a few hours someone pops by with everything you ordered. For dry cleaning just put everything in the dry cleaning bag and room service will pick it up. All of course is charged to your room. The free breakfast was a nice addition. Eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, waffles, pancakes, grits, cereal, milk, juices, pretty much all the standard breakfast items and it's all you can eat as well! The rooms are fantastic! Everything is low height which I love and for a 6ft person like myself it was perfect (tall people might not like it as much.) Everything was clean and new. The only minor negative was that a picture in my room had bad ahesive and kept popping open to reveal the circuit breaker behind it. Rooms were pretty soundproof, I couldn't hear anything from the other rooms nor from outside. AC was excellent as well, when I turned it on, the room was chilled in under a minute. The rooms included tea, coffee, popcorn for free as well. Overall this is going to be my go to spot when I'm in Phoenix! Great amenities, staff was ok, and a beautiful hotel. *If you don't make your check-in time for whatever reason they WILL give your room away and still charge you even if you have a 7 day booking like myself! We sorted it out with Marriott's upper management and ended up not being charged, but being forced to find another room and initally being charged is NOT COOL!",positive
"Shara and Lacey, the bartenders inside the lobby, were awesome! So accomodating and friendly. The rooms were clean and roomy. If I didn't have concert tickets I would have hung out in the lobby bar all night! I dig it! Good prices and discounts for the room like AAA...etc.",positive
Perfect stay. Nice staff. Clean room. I'll be back next month. It's a quick walk over to the Comerica Theater and we're right across the street from talking stick if that's what you need to come in for. Seemed like the hotel was on the new side. Price was right.,positive
"Overall, this is an excellent hotel. The staff is quite attentive and courteous. Rooms are modern with a nice place to work. The only problem is that the air conditioning is not powerful enough for the building. While you can park in the garage yourself, the garage is not well lit. Valet is strongly recommended.",positive
Nice new hotel! Affordable and convenient if you are attending a sporting event or concert. Friendly staff. Very clean and modern!,positive
"Shereka was a great party host, she kept up the morale and energy throughout the night! It was definitely worth the money to party in Vegas, VIP style! :)",positive
"Had a great time on this club crawl. Just as advertised, free well drinks at the first bar, a trip to the Las Vegas sign, liquor store, and admission to two other clubs. Our host, Zori, was awesome. She was friendly, fun, and accommodating for each guests needs. I'd definitely do this crawl again.",positive
"I've never been on a club crawl before until I booked with Rockstar and I had a blast! Our host Jonathan was awesome! At first I was a little shy being around new people I didn't know, but he made us feel comfortable and felt like we've been friends for a very long time. He made us laugh and has great dance moves!",positive
"We had such a great time with Jonathan, he was an amazing host and we had a great time hanging out with him and the rest of our bus-goers. He knows all the best spots to go and did a great job making sure we had fun. Thank you!!! We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas.",positive
"Took me a while to write this review, since I didn't know they had a Yelp page but since they do now I'm obliged to write my experience about my bar crawl with Jonathan (JFunky)!!! What can I say? This guy knows how to party and he's a breakdancer. I was entertained and felt safe And comfortable as him as the host. I already referred him to my cousin today who's coming to Vegas in July to make sure he books a bar crawl with him while he's there with his girlfriend for their birthday and they're coming from Portland, OR. Book your night with Jon. That's all I can say.",positive
"Honestly one of the best ideas I had in Vegas was to join this bar/club crawl. For $60, we got open bar for an hour and a half at PBR bar, which was more than enough to get us going. After that Chateau in Paris was amazing and we didn't have to pay a cover or wait to get in. Last, Drais was a blast and the whole night was awesome. For $60 you get open bar for 90 minutes, get to avoid covers at nice clubs, and don't have to wait in line to get it. This tour in particular was amazing and is a no-brainer to join. I would recommend to anyone going to Vegas for the first or 5th time Side note, our host Jonathan was awesome, really good host, and took care of everything. Could not recommend this tour enough",positive
"I went on a bar crawl one weekend and was not disappointed. The host Jonathan was handsome and charismatic! The crawl was great, the first pregame spot got me super excited and then the subsequent bars afterward was a hedonistic blur of pure delight. I can't express the pure joy I experienced adequately. It was a phantasmagoria of ecstasy Ill fated and confined into a single night that will stay with my being forever. Do yourself a favor and go on one of these tours, ask for Jonathan.",positive
"Came to Vegas last year and did this tour with my husband - we had a great time! Our guide Jon was super friendly and fun, and he knew all the cool things to do on the strip. We started at a smaller bar with all you can drink wrist bands for a few hours, then went to the Bellagio and Paris to dance. It was SO nice not having to wait in those crazy long lines! I would recommend this to anybody, but especially any one new to Vegas. The strip in particular can be really overwhelming and hectic for first timers, so it's helpful to have someone from there who basically maps out your entire night for you. Ask for Jon if you can!",positive
O my god! Best experience!! My host was Shereka n I love her! She gave me so good vibes that night and she knows how to party,positive
"Alex and Zori were absolutely amazing hosts! This is a cant miss crawl on your visit to Vegas! So glad we took the chance...from the open bar at PBR Rock bar, the Vegas sign, the party bus, and the clubs....wow!!!",positive
"If your in Vegas whether its your first time or not. Book with Rockstar Crawls, you will not regret it! I've been in plenty of bar crawls before, but not like this one. The first venue at PBR they give you an All You Can Drink for the first hour and a half. That's a pretty long time for open bar and pregame. I'm already drunk, but the real party starts once you get in the party bus! The music is bumping, the girls are dancing on the stripper pole and were still allowed to have drinks with us! We hit Chateau at the Paris which was crackin, the view is beautiful along with the crazy party. Then finally towards the end of the night we end up at Drais night club, which was EPIC. Overall I had a great time with all my friends and made memories that will last forever. I definitely got more than my moneys worth =)",positive
"Amazing crawl! The open bar is awesome, and the hosts are even better! The clubs were so much fun, and the lines were really short luckily. We started off at an open bar inside of the planet hollywood, then went on a limo ride around the strip for about an hour which was the best part! We got dropped off at the Bellagio and went into Hyde, then after that, we went to Chateau at the Paris. Overall, 5/5",positive
"Hotel rooms were less than expected. Lights in room didn't work and overall was a scrappy place. Maids were nice but front desk was very rude. They charged an additional fee for an extra bed even though we ordered a 2 bed room from the start and were told over the phone that there would be no charge. Very shady and terrible customer service. Door locks didn't work, no water in the pool or hot tub, breakfast was weak. Bad place AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",negative
"HORRIBLE customer service. The place is run down, with paint peeling off the walls. Breakfast was nothing more than bread, mini muffins, and watered down juice. The lock on our door didn't work multiple times and had to go down to the front desk multiple times to get it fixed. The swimming pool was emptied and torn to shreds. Not sure why. Stay away from this hotel, definitely not worth the money.",negative
"The rooms are OK. Breakfast was below expectations. The cleaning staff were good. The only thing HORRIBLE was the customer service by a middle eastern lady that calls herself ""Mayra."" Stay away from this lady. She has NO customer service at all. At checkout she was telling me that I reserved ""4"" rooms but I know I only reserved ""2."" She said that they didn't sell those other 2 rooms. And that I was ""LUCKY"" that they didn't charge me. I told her that I checked in fine and the gentleman that checked me in mentioned NOTHING about 4 rooms. Plus I was charged for the rooms HOURS before I checked in. So why wouldn't they have charged me for 4 rooms? Who knows. This lady was just throwing stuff out there trying to make one feel responsible for something that never happened. She didn't want to print out a receipt upon request. She said I would receive an email. I said NO I need a printed receipt. That seemed kinda shady. This ignited her to say that I was banned from reserving anything at their hotel and I had 5 minutes to leave the property or else she was calling the police. She pretended to call the police so I waited to give my story but police never showed. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!",negative
"First, the positives. The bed was clean and there were cleaned towels and bathroom supplies. The lock on my door didn't work and they told me I would have to wait a couple of hours until a maintenance person showed up. Free breakfast consisted of bread, blueberry mini muffins, cereal, and juice. Pretty sparse. Most of the paint in this place has scrapes or is peeling. Overall, a pretty run-down Hotel, but we were able to have a place to sleep.",negative
"If I could give a lower review, I would. I work for an adoption agency, and I sometimes have to put pregnant women in hotels to ensure they have a roof over their heads. One of our new birth moms was discharged from the hospital last Friday and we glady paid PREMIUM prices up front for 4 nights. After paying over $500 for 4 nights, we realized we needed one more night for this young woman to stay before she was able to get into a longer term living situation. The front desk advised me to go to choice hotels.com, as that is a way I could book one more night without physically being present (both the birth mom and myself have the flu today). Like Friday night, the front desk told me to complete a third party form to share my credit card information, which I promptly did. The owner then shows up 4 hours later and kicks out our birth mom saying that he no longer wanted to accept third party forms from small companies. He does this at 6pm, when this poor girl has nowhere to go. Shame on him!! She is very pregnant, not to mention sick. She is a sweet, meek young woman and doesn't deserve such treatment. We were only doing what the front desk tells us to do and he had no pity on her....He just got angry and left her in the lobby. Our company WILL NOT be using this hotel ever again. We are a very steady and successful company in the Phoenix area and he should show patrons more respect. Again he was happy to take $500+ via third party, but kicks out this gal and we would gladly have paid for one more night. If he wants to change policy in a day, fine. Just don't punish the patrons!!!! He should be ashamed of himself. Also, I asked the front desk to have him call me and he has yet to do so. He makes his poor employees handle this poor decision making. The front desk girl was sweet. She gets the one star! (I would give her 5 if I was just rating her).",negative
No where near royal! I would give them a minus if I could! The driver was soooo rude swearing and calling me and my parents with words i cannot say! He was upset because our route was not long! This is a disgrace for the Canadian transportation services!,negative
Pre- booked a cab to arrive at a certain time- finally comes 30min late. Despite dispatcher mentioning that the driver is only a minute around the corner after couple of intermittent calls. Simply not professional,negative
"Very bad Taxi company! I had to create a Yelp profile to tell you how shitty you are. You are really unreliable! I ordered a cab at 9:43 and 25min later the girl at dispatch tells me that the cab will be there in 10min. There is no Fucking way I am waiting 40min for cab! I ordered a Uber and it was there 2min later! Hey Morons, get your game together! We have a corporate account with you are not even able to guarantee your side or the contact. So how do you want individual clients to trust you? What a real joke!",negative
"I booked my trip on wheel trans.but unfortunately they assigned Royal taxi to take me to Humber River Hospital. they were suppose to pick me up at 5pm because my class was at 6pm, but they showed up at 6pm ( one hour late, still the dispatcher was telling driver to pickup one more customer and don't worry about me. worst service ever.",negative
Worse ride of my life. Never feel time can pass slower than in the car. The driver is so rude. I wish I read the review before I called for a reservation. There is reason why this company's review is so bad. Real people real experience. No wonder uber take over. They should understand we pay for the service not beg for free ride.,negative
"another cab refusing to do a short fare, would prefer to leave a woman on her own late at nite..he thought i was on my own, fare would have been about $15 as it was to get to my location. He decided he would only do it for $50. license bvay 867. An independent cab did the job and we tipped him well. I never considered uber but this experience changed that",negative
"Aggressive driving behaviour by cab 1339 on Thursday June 22nd, at 10:40pm on Parkside. The driver keeps honking at the cars in front and repeatedly try to pass on a one-lane street. The car almost hit us and continue to drive recklessly north towards Bloor. Management of Royal taxi should look into this driver history and behavior. This is why Uber wins.",negative
Watch the credit card scam!! Somehow my credit card was being used to pay for taxis (at least 13 times) with this company and I've never been to Toronto!! You are supposed to check ID if someone hands you a credit card!!,negative
"If I could give zero stars I would. As a customer I am sick and tired of dirty cabs, ignorant drivers that argue about route requests and a whopping charge at the end of the ride. I am also sick and tired of spending my entire ride listening to someone babble to their ""cousin back home"" and I am sick of listening to drivers endlessly complain about Uber. Uber would not exist if the cab industry had been doing its job by providing customer service in clean cars so from now on Im HAPPILY TAKING UBER.",negative
"Driver got me to where I wanted to go. I was just disgusted by him reaching in his shirt to scratch his armpits and then asking me to hand him my credit card for swiping. I didn't want him to touch my card, so I said I could swipe the card myself. There's that taxi card scam going on as well, so don't hand over your cards to drivers!",negative
"I called an hour before and they sent the taxi to the wrong address, I called back 3 times asking them where my taxi was. And they hung up and had no respect on the phone. I was half an hour late for work that day!! I will never call them again! If there is a 0 star I would give that.",negative
"The absolute worst. As per usual cabs in Toronto don't learn. Refuse to take paying patrons because they ""live to close"" and the cab won't be worth their time, or refuse to take debit. Again ILLEGAL. take Becks taxi at all times possible.",negative
"Horrible taxi service. I called in to order for a taxi. Lady took down my reservation and said a taxi is on its way. I waited for over a half hour and called again to ask for the status. The guy said ""sorry we don't have cars in your area try another company"" This is exactly why Uber is taking over. Never again will I use a taxi company, only Uber from now on.",negative
"If I did not have to use a work taxi chit then I would not solicit the services of Royal Taxi. Online reservations were ""lost"" and no taxi came. Called the dispatch to send me another taxi but that hasn't come either. This company is supremely unreliable. If you want your taxi to come 45 minutes after it was supposed to come, then by all means call Royal Taxi for your transportation needs",negative
"WOW!! Talk about awful awful service!! I told the cabbie a route that i always take to get the price down to what i usually pay. He then decided my route was a waste of gas and suggested and took another route before even asking me if it was okay and said his route is much better and faster yet more costive!! I told him no i dont want to overpay then what i have to he then said ok ill charge you the same as that route and he even knew the COST!!! Absurd! upon arriving to my destination the meter was more than double the amount and he tried to charge me the full thing saying how economy is down and gas rate is high, I SAID BS i already told him to take my route he didnt listen is it my problem ! NO AVOID ROYAL TAXI LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! ROYAL TAXI SERVICE should be called SPIT ON YOU PEASANT SERVICE!",negative
"Unacceptably long (as in, MINIMUM 20 minutes) wait time every time I've had to resort to them (and as a result, every cab from their ""service"" has made me late), dispatcher may or may not be understandable, drivers usually need directions from you, and they rudely ask you how you're paying when you call for the cab. Not using them again. I only used them at any time because I couldn't get through at all to Beck. But someone answering by no means guarantees you'll get a cab with anything but a very long wait time.",negative
"A Royal Taxi was behind me on Finch. I slowed and stopped for an on-coming ambulance with lights on. The Royal Taxi driver behind me started blasting me with the horn. Apparently, in the Royal Taxi manual, Royal Taxis have rights over emergency vehicles. Piece of shit company hires piece of shit drivers. Avoid.",negative
"To the dispatcher who we dealt with Saturday, you're a #$*@! -10 stars if possible. To the superstar cab driver who came across town to drop something off to me. I give you 10 stars. I really wish I got your card as I want everyone to take your cab and tip you well! Coles Notes: * Left phone in car and realized it but cab took off in less than 10 seconds. * Concierge at condo checks camera and gets Royal Taxi and license plate. * Call Royal to see if they can send cab back (less than 2 minutes away) with license plate, time, make and model of the car. * Royal dispatch is extremely rude to concierge. 8 After being really rude tells they don't know who drives what cab but will put it out on dispatch. * Not put out on dispatch. * Friends keep calling phone until cabbie picks up. * Remember me and re-unites me with phone. Thank you Royal Taxi cab driver!!! Royal Taxi dispatch, you suck.",negative
"Can I rate this a negative infinity? Because that is my real rating! I was verbally assaulted by the cab driver and when I called their customer service, the woman was terrified from all his screaming she could hear through my cellphone. He was yelling at his Royal Taxi colleagues on his phone/ dispatch line too! He had over 9 phone exchanges with them while he seized my credit card and alternated between verbally attacking me and screaming at them on his phone/dispatch lines. The girl on the end of my line said she would inform the supervisor, that ""he is completely out of line,...we don't allow that,.. he shouldn't do this"" blah blah blah. Seriously, if such a lunatic works with this company and is also yelling at his own colleagues, they must be ok with it. I mean, do the taxi cams and call recorders mysteriously not catch ANY of his random episodes? He must be related to someone high up there to get away with this kind of madness. And the level of intensity that came with it was not of a first timer. This man must have harassed other passengers in the past and knew how to get away with it. Apparently, Toronto Police can't do anything unless he physically assaults me or verbal threatens my life. And you wonder why some people have to lie/exaggerate? Maybe by claiming he threatened to kill me, I would have halted a dissolving psychopath and saved some potential female victim's life. Yes it would be a woman because trust me, if I was some huge muscular guy, or was in the company of a man, this motherf***ing coward would not squeak much less hold my card hostage so he could verbally assault me some more. That was one traumatizing experience. What brought on this rage, you ask? He did not like my destination. Yes!! You read that correctly. I wanted to go downtown to Dundas but he gave me an unrealistic time estimate. Since I knew the subway would be faster than his time estimate, I decided to get off at Davisville station and subway it the rest of the way. He did not like this. He decided he was going to charge me the fee of Lawrence to Dundas even though I was getting off at Davisville because ""there is a minimum $15 charge so I will charge you $22"" (Huh??? Come again?). When I refused to sign the receipt, Mr Hyde threw his mask out the window and came at me with full force! He seized my credit card, yelled at me to get out of the car and turned down the windows because he thought I had it good, enjoying the heat from his cab (it was winter) while I was on the phone with the customer service and then the police, trying to get this guy to stop charging my card repeatedly and hand it over. The whole ordeal lasted 40 minutes. I was emotionally shaken and extremely late to my function (they were wrapping up). I called Royal Taxi again the next day and managed to get a hold of the manager. At first he said he would trace the driver, then when I called back to follow up, he said the cops had already contacted him and they had sorted it out. This was a lie. I asked the police and they never spoke to this manager so he just lied to get me off the phone and didn't even bother to investigate or reprimand such a bizarrely unacceptable behaviour. I guess the cab driver gets to assault another day.",negative
"I refuse to ever take Royal Taxi again. The drivers are rude, and they tell you they do not accept credit card upon your arrival at your destination (which is FALSE!). I've also had money stolen from me, as the cab driver charged extra onto my credit card, and the amount charged was more than what the meter indicated. After calling in to customer service, they refused to do anything about it. Very poor communication, and business ethics. I will never take Royal Taxi in Toronto.",negative
"Called them with a question about changing a drop off location...the person on the other end was a really RUDE POS. If you are a person who works for a company that helps people who are in need of special services, have a little class...maybe stop thinking about that paycheck. It's take a special person to work for those who are in need...the customer service person who answered the call...AIN'T that person. ID 10 T to",negative
"I appreciate and depend on the service but hate calling for a ride. Most of the people I have talked with who schedule have no personality. No ""you're welcome"" when I say ""thank you"". I called recently and said, I would like to schedule a ride to ------ then asked a question. The man I was talking to said, you are calling RTC Paratransit. I already knew who I was calling but the recording said it was SNTC. I was told to call RTC Paratransit. That was not my question. Next he asked what time I wanted to go not what day. Because I was not calling for the next day I gave him the day and date. Sometimes I think these people hate their job and find it annoying when we call. Most of the drivers greet me as I board, say you're welcome as I exit and thank them.",positive
"Up until now, having to depend on the Paratransit Ride Service wasn't too bad. But today, things went wrong in a HUGE way. After waiting close to an hour - my designated window of assigned time, plus extra time outside that window - I was told by the representative that the bus had been to my complex, waited for me and then LEFT. I sat where I could see the bus come in the entire time, and NOBODY SHOWED UP. No other bus is coming to replace the one that left, and when I asked if this would count as a 'no-show' on my account, all I was told is that it would have to be 'investigated.' This was not only a waste of time, but no consideration was shown for whether or not I had an appointment to make or anything. This is about as unprofessional as it gets.",negative
"I have used their service now three times for my disabled wife to get to Doctor's appointments. All I can say is Wow! The driver's are great, scheduling folks are outstanding. Never had any problems getting her to the appointments on time and back home quickly. A truly great service offered to residents and visitors who are disabled.",positive
"Thank you RTC Transit and Joe Mark for your quality services. Keep up the good work. Like everything else in Vegas, a bit overpriced, but a good ride.",positive
This transit system is clean and safe. When you compare it to the RTD system in Los Angeles . The bus driver is well protected. Good experience. A bit pricy $6 per person for 2 hour pass.,positive
"Amazing experience. Must do if you make it to Montreal. The owner, Jack, is an American ex-pat who explains everything diligently and ensures safety but also an incredibly fun and action packed adventure. Driver Todd and guide Eric were fantastic and really helped take the bachelor party to the next level. Todd provided much appreciated advice on what to see and do in Montreal and even lent our group his personal bicycles to tour the city on.",positive
Place was a great time and beat all expectations. Time in the rapids was way more exciting than I thought. I thought it was just going to be a high speed boat on a river boy was I wrong. We were getting crushed with rapids and fully soaked! Bunch of other bachelor parties were also on the boat and it was a great way to kick a hangover at 12pm. Tip: They hold all of your belongings so don't worry about not bringing a phone or wallet. BRING SPARE CLOTHES the old port is such a cool little spot to walk around and wish we brought a pair of clothes so we could have changed and walked around.,positive
"So we did the smaller boat, where you get ""less"" wet. It was only me and my family so we all sat in the back row. Daniel was our driver and he asked us how wet we wanted to get. So we picked medium because we wanted to get lunch after. He takes you around the St Laurent and does a bunch of 360 degree turns in the water. those are where you get wet. It was a blast though. Best half hour of the trip for sure. I'd definitely recommend if you have teenagers/kids because my brother and I definitely appreciated doing that over the slow boat ride my parents originally had in mind.",positive
"I wasn't exactly sure of what to expect, but the experience was nothing but fun! I've gone white water rafting and this was definitely very different. The fear isn't a part of the trip -- just fun and pleasure! Definitely come with a change of clothes. They will provide shoes, too and j would recommend this was the shoes I wore from home I had to clean with a toothbrush when j for home because of the residue from the river. I would definitely do this again! Many smiles!",positive
"This was an awesome experience. I would highly recommend adding this to your itinerary if you are visiting Montreal. The first 10 minutes of the ride were relatively relaxing. We got some nice views of Montreal and our hilarious guide (Todd) gave us some interesting city facts. After that, prepare to get soaked! The rapids/waves can get pretty intense and it felt like a mini-roller coaster ride on water. The first row pretty much got slammed with the most water, especially the individuals sitting on the edges. My group and I sat in one of the middle rows and we got our fair share of the water. We went on a blazing hot summer day, but after the first several waves, I was already shivering. After the fun is done, the wind on the ride back will help dry you off a bit. TL;DR: here are some quick tips: 1. Bring a towel, wear a swimsuit during the ride, and bring a change of clothes for afterwards (they have bathrooms/changing rooms) 2. There is an area to store your valuables 3. Do not bring your phone or camera unless it is water-proof or highly water-resistant 4. The optional poncho will not protect you from water (you are guaranteed to get wet), but it can be used as a windbreaker 5. Wear their booties unless you brought your own flip-flops or water-shoes 6. If you sit in the front row, prepare to have water crash into your face",positive
"Je l'ai fait l'√©t√© 2014, et j'ai beaucoup aim√©! Le staff est super sympa, ils vous font passer un agr√©able moment, vous expliquent bien tout, etc.. Quand vous arrivez dans les Rapides, c'est vraiment l'fun! √ßa saute dans tous les sens et attention, √ßa mouille!! :) Une bonne activit√© d'√©t√©, √† faire quand il fait bien chaud sinon on peut vite attraper froid! A essayer!",positive
So.. Much.. Fun!!! Don't sit in the front if you don't want to get wet. Like a roller coaster ride on the water. Wear all of the waterproof gear AND wear a swimsuit. Only go when it's warm!,positive
"AMAZING!!!! So much fun. We sat in the front, and we had the time of our lives. It was perfect. The guide on the boat was also super funny and informative on the ride to the rapids. Great experience. However. what really set them apart was the fact that my cousin lost one of her flip flops. When we got back, they gave her a pair of flip flops (for free). It was so nice and unexpected. You can really tell that everyone just wants you to have a greta time. Tips: Do the 10 am ride with the $10 off coupon. Worth it! Wear a bathing suit - you get soaked. Wear the booties they offer you - its easy to lose a flip flop! Thank you so much guys!!!",positive
"I had my second trip to Montreal and my second jet boat tour with my family. Both times it was the highlight of the trip. Think twice however about sitting in the front row. Every wave came crashing into your face. My wife thought she injured her neck, and everyone else ended up with lots of water up their nose. A couple of answers to questions we had before we went: They have changing rooms and an area to keep valuables. They offer you pullovers to keep warm, water shoes and ponchos that are wind breakers. Nothing will keep you from getting wet. On the boat, our row had rubber bags that you could put your glasses in right before you go down the rapids.",positive
"aka Saute Moutons This might be the most (summer type) fun that I've ever had! Do not miss this when in Montreal. First you sit through an info session which is amusing & multi lingual. They offer all kinds of goofy looking but much needed (trust me, and them) clothing and life jackets. You can also leave your valuables with them, and there are changing rooms. They say bring a towel and a change of clothing and they are not kidding, even undergarments, as you'll be soaked through. Pockets in front of you on the boats can hold small valuables, but wrap them in a plastic bag. Next you board the boats and ride to the Lachine (?) rapids area. Ask the staff where to sit if you want to get really nailed by the waves. People in the front row get constantly hammered with walls of waves. Those in the middle and toward the back get it too, just not so constantly - and that's the fun of it. Who knew that there were class five rapids ten minutes from the city?! The helmeted & bull horned guide explains what's going on. The boats are so well built, powerful (twin 66o motors?!) and the captain so skilled, it's not scary, just crazy fun. The ride back even has a few surprises.",positive
"AKA the SAUTE-MOUTONS. Those French Canadians are out of their minds with this boat ride. Its a big open jet barge like I've never seen anywhere else in NA. They basically take you out and slam you into Giant Waves in the middle of the ST.L Seaway...who knew there were Giant waves there?! Anyways its one of the most fun things I can think of. And when they tell you that you will get wet just aniticpate the same experience as jumping in and out of a 6' deep pool. So double rap you valuables with bags they will give you. Its located deep in the Old Port, you basically park near the an old shipping Pier. So just keep asking people where it is. If you're American let the Frenchies know when you ask for direction and they will be nicer to you, since they hate English Americans less than English Canadians who don't try to speak french.",positive
"We come to Vegas frequently (every 2-3 months) from San Diego for car shows and events. Silverton is always the host hotel, so we have stayed here numerous times. The hotel is always accommodating to the car clubs, and they give us our own parking level each time. They offer group discounts which is helpful when you're staying for 4-5 days, plus paying for all of the events and registration to the car event itself. The staff is always welcoming and kind, and I have seen the same staff for years, so they must treat their employees well to keep turnover low. All of the restaurants in the hotel are good. We've eaten at all of them and can't choose a favorite. There is also a gelato stand at one of them! Win! Of course, I also love the burgers and fries at Johnny Rockets! The bar area and aquarium have great ambiance. Have you seen the mermaid that swims around doing shows throughout the day? Who doesn't love mermaids?! Now, I'm not an outdoors-y person, but their Bass Pro shop is SO COOL. Not only can you shop for outdoor adventure gear, but you also get an up close and personal look at some interesting taxidermy. The hotel itself is dated and getting old (that's the -1 star), so it would be nice if they started to upgrade it, but its not a deciding factor if we'll stay here. Its easy to get to the freeway and familiar to us, so we'll be coming back.",positive
"I went to the Winter Wonderland to skate, but the ice was fake, so I couldn't skate on that thing. I had to walk on the rink. I totally didn't expect to have that kind of experience as they advertised that there is an 'ICE' RINK. They didn't say it's fake. Thus my boyfriend wanted to talk with a manager, but the Mexican guy was so rude that he didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. He kept saying that he cannot understand my boyfriend, even though my boyfriend is speaking in proper English. I don't know how he got the manager position with that attitude and disability to have conversation with customers. Hopefully nobody goes to the event and wastes money. It was such an unpleasant experience. It also ruined my view about Silverton. It will be my last time to go to Silverton nor any other event will be held at the casino.",negative
"I like this casino. It has a tank inside where you can watch a mermaid. The girl is actually dressed in a fin costume for her fins with a sea shell bra top. Pretty cool for the whole family to watch especially the kids. For the adults, there's plenty of slot machines to play along with food eateries here. Starbucks is inside along with other eateries. Casino is clean and plenty of space to walk around. There's plenty of parking in front so parking shouldn't be an issue. I definitely enjoyed going to this casino. It's located right off the freeway. Not too bad. I enjoyed coming here. I will definitely be back.",positive
"Worst casino visit ever. I visit there on 7/3 which is independent day week. 4 of us played slot and table game for 4-5 hours. Off course, we lost money. That's ok. We just visit and play for fun. We asked just $15 burgers for each person for lunch and we only got $5 per person. This is kinds of crazy that they don't comp lunch for players. I asked floor managers and they didn't have records for my table play??? I said I was these 2 table for 3-4 hours, but manager said that he just got here so he doesn't know??? This casino is still doing old style paper to write how much player change and how long player played. If last floor manager lost paper, they don't care. Never go back and recommend never go there. Also, very dirty casino.",negative
"The bar machines cash you out at 1200. Even without hitting a jackpot and without warning . Extremely disappointed in management here, they handled the situation poorly. I'm a local and don't plan on coming back.",negative
"Check in process was pretty fast but the check in area is on the small side. I was told that all of their rooms have been renovated. But I was hoping that they would have put me in the new tower. Elevator could have also used an upgrade like the rooms. I was pleasantly surprised how cozy and updated the my room was. The bed looked new and the sheets/beddings felt high end. There was also a 42"" flat screen with a media area where you can connect your hdmi/usb cables along with power outlets. The media center reminds me of the high end hotels you find on the strip. I was surprised that all of the channels were actually in HD. Most of the time when you stay at 3 star hotels, some of the channels are not in HD or have bad quality pictures. The bed was pretty comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side. When closing the door, you have to step aside next to the toilet. I didn't like this at all because sometimes my leg would brush up against the toilet bowl. I wished they would have renovated the bathroom and made it bigger. There was plenty of room to do so. There is definitely enough room to put a queen size airbed here. My biggest complaint about this place is that they turned off the water the next morning due to a leak in the building. I did not appreciate this at all. They should have notified us that they were going to shut off the water at 12pm so that I could have taken a shower prior to that. When I walked downstairs and spoke to the hotel manager, she was not very nice or welcoming. She started to get defensive when I told her that this was unacceptable and I should have been notified about the water being turned off. I had asked her if she can put me in another room and she quickly shut that request down telling me that water to the whole building was shut off. I find that hard to believe, but whatever. She could have relocated me to the new tower. But instead, she only credited me the resort fee for one day. I don't even know why a hotel of this caliber should be charing a resort fee as there was really nothing to do at the resort in the middle of winter. It's not like you could go to the pool. The only thing I took advantage of was the WiFi. Although, it didn't even ask for login credentials. So the WiFi was open to the public. You can just walk in the door and connect to the WiFi with not charge. It's not fair that they charge their paying guests for this when it's free for everyone else. This really put a bad taste in my mouth. I will think twice about staying here the next time. Also, they mostly played Country music the whole time I was there. I wished they would have played something else or at least not be so Country heavy.",negative
"Stayed nearby at an RV resort, but ate at two of their restaurants and had good meals there. Don't miss the giant aquarium inside (including occasional swimming mermaid).",positive
"The only reason I'm giving one star is so the yelp can let me post but I would give the Silverton no stars !! My wife and I stayed at this hotel this past Wed all the way up till Saturday it was a horrible experience!!! My wife has an aunt that is a cancer survivor which was humiliated and their buffet the Manager Ariana made a joke about my wife's aunt because she has one eye due too cancer apparently that is funny to her !!when we put in a complaint it was worst !! The manager of the hotel did not speak to us to address the problem.It felt as if they did not care. They sent the security Jimmy to handle the situation and this security was harassing my wife to sign voluntarily forms of a complaint!!! Who does that ??? But that's not all when we checked out Saturday the same security accused my wife and I for vomiting on the sheets !!! In front of several people !!! It was embarassing and we were being falsely accused. This was clearly another harassment stunt on the securitys behalf and the hotel/assistant manager, manager was in on it My wife and aunt were very humiliated and drained we went there to relax and for a vacation !!! I wouldnt wish this experience upon anyone for I am still dumbfounded.",negative
"This is such a great hotel! The staff is super friendly! They have different restaurants to eat at, from Johnny Rockets to a noodle house! The rooms are super comfy! Love this place!",positive
"The Silverton is better than the strip, not as much traffic, you can't smell the cigarette smoke, the atmosphere is relaxing, the staff is excellent. We've already made plans to come back this year, it's Super Bowl Sunday and we'll be watching at the casino we can't wait. We will be recommending this casino to everyone we know.",positive
"I've taken 3 short gambling trips to this casino, and every time I walked out with less money than I came with. That said, I still give it five stars because they offer great rules on their double deck blackjack, low minimums, a pleasant and refreshing ambiance, great comps, friendly dealers, and an all around great experience. I'd like to see them improve the rules a bit on their single deck game, but that is about my only complaint. Great place and I will certainly return in the near future.",positive
"How do you make a wanna be five star hotel into a three star hotel? Have all of the lighting in the rooms remind you of a Steven King plot. The Shining comes to mind as you enter the room. We were booked for a two night stay but will be leaving first thing in the morning. I thought a bulb was out, not so. They have rewired the lamps so the room is dark and uninviting. The bed was comfortable and had nice bedding and pillows. I did hear a lot of thumping around three in the morning, I think it was in the room above 3026. The view of the pool and court yard was nice. If you choose to stay at The Silverton don't stay in this dungeon room. I like that they have a free shuttle to and from the airport and Caesars. I did enjoy the casino and Johnny Rockets malts.",negative

"I'm a Vegas local & I often bring guests to Silverton, my favorite locals casino. The d√©cor is beautiful, with a giant fish tank. Bass Pro Shop is a fun place to explore & Mi Casa Restaurant is stunning!",positive
"The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. Each person I talked to while staying at the Silverton was very rude and condescending. While staying at the hotel, I spilled soda on some of my boyfriends clothes so I asked for dry cleaning and when I went to pay for JUST the dry cleaning, they charged my card and drained all my money, plus I owed my bank over $300. That day my boyfriend decided to check his bank records and the silverton drained his account too. All his money, gone. We went to the front desk to get it straightened out, talked to both the assistant manager and the manager and both we not very willing to help. They said it wasn't them and after they messed around on the computer a bit, his money was back yet the still deny taking it. How is it not them when we did nothing but talk to the front desk when we saw it was missing, and now it's magically back? After two days, I got my money back as well. But they never said sorry or offered any compensation. We had no money. It was our last day in Vegas. We would have been stranded sleeping in our car until we somehow got money if we weren't so persistent with the Silverton. After speaking with them that morning, they changed our checkout from noon to 10 AM to get rid of us. We didn't even know we were checked out We are never going back. It discouraged us from going to Las Vegas for awhile",negative
"I've been to Silverton to gamble a couple of times and the casino itself is not bad, but definitely not great either. This was the first time I stayed in the hotel because we couldn't get a good hotel on the Strip for a Friday night so we decided to give Silverton a try. The room and hotel were mediocre and I felt like I couldn't wait to change to the Venetian the next night. The room was drab and had an old and loud window unit A/C. The bathroom in our standard room was really small and you felt cramped using it. Lastly, I didn't appreciate being jumped on by timeshare vultures upon waking into the casino with our luggage and then they tried again as soon as we checked in. That's just gross!",negative
"I did not stay here.... But this place is awesome! It has one of the largest Bass Pro Shops with the BIGGEST bass I have ever seen. It's like the size of a shark people. The casino is nice and very new. The buffet is AMAZING. Cleaned our plates. From the front door you can see the construction on the new ""new"" part of the strip. That's very cool.",positive
"The pool was closed for the evening and the hotel even has a sign, ready to close the pool for any given event. This is not fair for patrons that plan and pay for the use of the pool and are not allowed. Also, it took over two weeks for the Silverton to even respond to my feedback.",negative
This casino is ok...nothing spectacular. The restaurants are ok - not great. We just moved into the area and it's close to our house. My husband and I do enjoy gambling and tend to end up here because of its location from our house. After the last couple of times going though we are thinking of going to another casino. Our major complaint with this casino is the cocktail service. We have sat there gambling and not getting any service at all!! The waitresses were sitting by the bar talking instead of taking care of customers. I'm not sure they understand that the more you walk around and take care of the customers the more money you make! Sorry to say even though it's the closest - I don't think we will be back for gambling.,negative
"Went for New Years. Very nice casino, drinks tasted like they were watered down. Staff were very friendly and service was decent considering the crowed. Over all a good experience.",negative

Nice casino that is on the outskirts of town but still within 10 minutes of the strip depending on traffic. Silverton itself is a nice casino that has alot of events that happen here from food festivals to gun shows. You can find a hidden gem at Twin Creeks with a great happy hour and good food. Definetly a good place to check out when your in town.,positive
"The Silverton Casino was once one of those temporary homes for me when I first moved here. My temp stays were either at South Point or the Silverton due to one big thing...that's price. This casino/hotel is small, clean, and the rooms are cheap. The rooms itself are set up to mimic a lodge, at least that's what Silverton attempted to do. My favorite at his hotel is their room service. The menu is fairly extensive and since I became a regular at one point, I was able to develop a good relationship with the room service staff. Yes, they hooked it up and took care of me. As for the casino floor, the gaming is average with minimal action. Some other highlights include their scuba mermaid aquarium, one of the largest Bass Pro Shops, and super cheap Happy Hour. Only downfall with his hotel is that it's far from the strip. If you're here, then your options are limited to just this casino unless you're willing to drive a little.",positive
"It's been awhile since i've commented on the closest casino to my abode. The place has grown on me: Some of the factors for the bump up: Parking - i either valet or i have a special parking spot i have on the first floor of the covered parking - not a legal spot ( and no, i ain't taking a handicapped spot ! ) so improvement on the parking options Gambling - I primarily play craps and video poker. The craps limit has been bumped up to $5 but still 10x odds ( good ) but no fire bet ( bad .) A MAJOR plus is that they serve dogfish head IPA while playing at the tables - not sure how long that will last but i'm taking full advantage while i can !!The video poker is ok - nothing special. Haven't played bingo there in ages but i did win last time i did play so bonus points for that. Comps/Rewards - I sense they are generous to me on the table rewards ( i can never really figure out how they give you points/comps ) I like that i can use the comps in the gift shop ( actually, the gf does - she seems to get a new purse/handbag every other week ! ) and i really like they occasionally reduce the food cost at the restaurant by 50% if you use your points. every month they send me some free play and free food - it's on par with station casinos and coast casinos. Shows - not sure what they have, don't really care ! Bars - I like the 3 bars/lounges - bartenders are nice, reasonable prices and generous pours. Restaurants - We frequent the coffee shop and the buffet - I feel they are the best of the local casinos. Twin Creeks - haven't been in ages which is a shame - it's one of the best deals in town in terms of price/quality. Overall an above average casino for the local scene.",positive
"I was driving through Las Vegas but didn't want to get too far off the highway in search of a buffet. Seeing a Casino and a Bass Pro right off the road before I even got into town reeled me in (get it?). So I weave my way through the gaming room and get into line to pay for some delicious buffet. These nice ladies in line asked me if I was going to pay for the buffet. Not one to steal food I replied that that was my plan. Next thing you know I'm eating free buffet courtesy of these lovely women who had a spare free meal ticket. Thank you Ladies! So, the food was merely ok. The thing that pissed me off was that the crab legs weren't cracked well enough to get at the meat. That drives me crazy. I have seen nearly 3 episodes of the Deadliest Catch and know the perils that real men go through to deliver mountains of delicious crab meat to consumers like me. Why do they insult the memory of Justin by not cracking the damn crab legs? I would have been intrigued to have a few mimosas with my benefactors but I had to hit the road.",negative
"This is a review for the casino property, not the rooms. I used to come here quite often when I lived in the area, before all the renovations a few years ago and I still make the drive from time to time. I liked it then and still like it now. It's a great little locals casino. They always have great offers, they have a good variety of restaurants and their promotions always seem to entice me to check it out. I don't gamble, but I enjoy all the different gathering places they have available on property. Even during the summer they have free locals access to the pool and fun outdoor concerts in the evenings.",positive
I was coming into town a day early (Saturday) and I was looking for a cheap place to stay and I found it here. All the other hotels were way over $100 even off of the strip. When I made my reservation I requested a non-smoking king and I was very disappointed to receive a smoking room with two queen beds. But it was around 7:30pm and I was too tired to care. To my surprise the room was quite nice and it did not have a smokey smell to it. So it turned out OK after all. The casino and bars were pretty crowded so this is a well known spot. I have been through here before and I visited the huge Outdoor World store that they have. Even if you're not into outdoor activities it's a fun store to wander around in and kill some time. They also have a huge aquarium and they had a mermaid swimming around inside. It was pretty cool. I met my friend that night for dinner at Mi Casa Catina. It was OK...you can read my separate review for that. My room came to around $70 and that was a pretty good deal. Other than the fire alarm going off at 6:30am I enjoyed my stay here and I would definitely come here again.,positive
"This is just about the buffet. They cater to locals but its also great if you're just coming into Vegas from Los Angeles. If you're on I-15 just look left prior to the blue diamond exit. Get a players card and your first buffet may be free. UPDATE: Monday Senior buffet for players card holders is just $5. The food is really good. Not as good as some on the strip, but it's not $50 either. You won't be disappointed.",positive
"I like this place.A place where a lot of locals come to gamble,eat and probably go shopping.The bass pro shop is connected to the casino.They have a nice aquarium for the kids,the food is very reasonable and the dinner buffet is great considering that it is off the strip.But,there is a lot of the strip that people should venture to...not everything has to be high priced to be good in vegas..rooms clean,people nice,pool medium size-small...but a good price to stay at...I like it.",positive
"Came and stayed here at the last minute when our plans to stay at a friend's house fell through. Since we were planning on driving down the 215 to pass through the Hoover Dam on to the Grand Canyon the next day, we were between this place and the Tropicana. Walked into the Trop and the line to check in was practically out the door, so we hopped back in the car and drove to this place. $48 for a non-smoking double bed room at 2 am on a Thursday night? With no notice? Score! I'm sure the room would have been cheaper by booking online in advance, but at what they offered it to us for? We'll take it! The room was very clean, but the view was DISMAL-- of a service area with a cherry picker and a golf cart-- but what can you expect from an off-Strip hotel and casino with only 4 stories of hotel rooms? The bathroom offered Bath & Body Works soaps, which was nice, and the stay was nice as well, although housekeeping tried to come in at like 8 am. Seriously? If I need a last minute room in Vegas ever again, I'll definitely try this place out.",positive
We came to stay just one night to go shopping then the next morning go to Carowinds. This place is so clean and classy simple decor. Nothing bad at all to say. Will definitely stay here again. Can't wait to try out the free breakfast buffet in the morning.,positive
This hotel ended up being a great choice! It turned out out being a much more upscale hotel than I visioned a Sleep Inn being! The cost was less than other nearby hotels but we took a chance and are glad we did! Quick check in and courteous desk clerk! Room decor very up scale. Would stay here again! Very close to good restaurants you can even walk to!,positive
Hotel itself is fine. Our room smoke detector started chirping at 1am! Not fine! Called the front desk and was told he would call me back. Never did. I called him and was told they could not do anything because he was alone. Hmmm! Well I can't sleep with that going on every 10 seconds. So I have to move down the hall to a different room. That's fine! Very inconvenient and annoying! What hotel doesn't keep the smoke alarm batteries changed on a regular schedule ??,negative
"We stayed here the weekend of my husband's birthday, when we took a trip with friends for his birthday to hang out for the weekend. In our room, we had 2 double beds and it was plenty enough for what we needed for my hubby and myself, and our daughter! The beds were comfortable. I would have loved a larger bed, however, we were on a budget and time constraint, so we took what we could get, and I was very pleased! The beds were super comfortable, and the staff was very friendly! The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing to rave about, but better than some I have had at hotels before!",positive
"I believe in most cases that you get what you pay for. Two friends and I shared a room (two double beds) for $69.00 plus tax. You really can't beat the price and you're super close to Concord Mills which is great. The rooms have a weird odor to them, the bathroom was incredibly small, and you could hear through the walls. I woke up really early because apparently there were kids staying in the room above us and they needed to do gymnastics at 6 am. They DO have free wifi and a seasonal pool.",negative
Thin walls. Rooms with no tubs - just showers. ...Small TV - with no pay -per-view options. ...My room was clean and staff was efficient.,negative

I arrived 10 at morning after a 6 hour flight. I have interview tomorrow morning. I asked them to check me in as soon as they can. Although people checked out sooner but There was a front desk named Victor who was not welcoming at all. He just repeats checks in are at 3 pm. I know the rulles and regulations but hotels are always flexible and try to satisfy their customers especifically when they have vacancies. It all how they treat customers. I do not recommend this Hotel to anyone since they are not acommodating and welcoming. I wanted to talk to manager and he did not even let me to do so,negative
"There were four major problems with our stay at Sleep Inn Mesa: 1. The window was broken -- not just a nick or chip, but cracked from one end to the other. If we had needed egress in case of fire or other emergency, that window would have been a huge hazard. It also made us feel that we had booked a second-class hotel room. What hotel doesn't replace a broken window? When I mentioned it to the desk clerk right after we checked in, she thanked me and said they'd let maintenance know! 2. The toilet leaked. It was really disgusting to get up in the middle of the night, walk into the bathroom, and get my feet wet! Ick! 3. Something in the air conditioner rattled loudly. Every time it kicked on we were awakened. Eventually we got up and propped suitcases against it thinking it was the cover rattling, but that didn't help. The rattle was coming from inside. 4. There was a dog a couple doors down who barked and cried incessantly. We had mentioned to the desk clerk in the afternoon that there was a dog on the third floor who was doing a lot of barking and we hoped it wouldn't continue all night. Her response was, ""We're on it!"" She was obviously not, since the dog kept it up all through the night. Judging from the police cruisers at the door when I checked out, the desk clerk was obviously not having a good day, but she nonetheless asked how everything was. I detailed the problems (two of which I had already discussed with the desk clerk the previous day) and she apologized profusely, commenting that it sounded like we'd had a truly miserable night. She did let us know that the dog down the hall was definitely an ""undeclared"" dog and that those folks had been charged the maximum fine for having it there. She acknowledged that it didn't do much for me, but that the hotel chain had a Satisfaction Guarantee. She said she would leave my information with the manager and see what could be done. She checked the computer to make sure they had my correct email and noted that I was a Choice Privileges member, so she was sure I'd hear from the manager. I heard nothing from anyone.",negative
"Very nice accommodation for what I payed. Room was a little small but clean and nicely decorated. There was two adults and two kids and we all slept good. The beds were 5starts for sure. The breakfast was pretty ok nothing special -the standard cold stuff -cereal, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and then toast and breads, some waffles and cooked eggs and sausages. Overall never stayed at a Sleep Inn before but will totally do it again - especially this one.",positive
"Stayed here and soon after regretted that choice. The room smelled horrible when I walked in and would never walk on the carpet bare foot. After I checked out was accused of smoking in the room, and I have never had a cigarette in my life. They charged my card $150 and the manager refused to credit me back, even though I don't smoke. Said I was ultimately responsible for the room. I was at the hotel by myself, so not like I had friends hanging out with me. Will never stay at a Choice Hotel again.",negative
"Don't stay on the first floor, you hear every footstep and door closing from the second floor. The free breakfast is nothing special, after looking at the horde of people waiting for a waffle we decided to just go out to eat. Also, bring your own pillow unless you're into shoebox sized pillows. Other than those issues the accommodations were ok.",negative
"This is a nice hotel, not the best, but it's nice. It was great for the price, especially the free breakfast. However, the reason for the five stars is not for the actual hotel, which was clean, comfortable, but not super special. The rating for this hotel is for the staff. They were friendly, sweet, helpful and took far of problems quickly. There were a couple of issues that came up that were no fault of the staff, but they took care of the problems quickly and with great customer service. An added plus is that the diner that shares a parking lot with the hotel is awesome.",positive
My wife forgot to take her favorite North Face jacket out of the closet after checking out and when we checked to see if it had been turned in by housekeeping it wasn't. Their shady employees will keep us from returning to this hotel.,negative
"Great room and amenities. Very clean, friendly staff, and an included breakfast all for an affordable price. Can't beat that!",positive
"It's hard not to give this place 5 stars. There are some caveats about this hotel which I'll explain keep but they don't really hurt the rating. Pros: 1. Easy to find and easy to get in and out of from both the Scottsdale Rd side and the Bell side. 2. Clean lobby and rooms for the most part. 3. Good (enough) breakfast. Clean, fresh, constantly replenished. Usual cereal, waffle bar, hot breakfast of some sort of eggs, potatoes and sausage, and toasts. They make these tiny little cheese omelettes which are surprisingly good 4. Ice water is always available. Cookies in the afternoon. 5. Close to freeways (but not too close to be skanky) and restaurants. 6. Good shower height, water pressure and temp. 7. Good internet speed. Free! 8. Staff are nice and helpful! 9. Price is good. Cons (which may not really affect the rating, it is what it is, but you should know about them prior to booking because it could be a deal breaker) 1. Toilet is in separate room from sink. I usually hate this because it's just gross. But it wasn't a big deal for my stay because I was alone and could just have the door open. 2. The toilet and shower, as mentioned, are in a separate, closet sized room. The door is a sliding door. This would be a deal breaker for me if I was traveling for business and had to split a room with someone. Privacy is so limited due to this! 3. The shower is just that, a shower. No bath. Not a problem for me, but again, may as well highlight it so everyone knows. Again, if you're showering and splitting the room with someone you don't want to see you get dressed you have to dress in this tiny room using the closed toilet to hold your clothes. 4. I had 2 double beds. Only needed one, but the dbl closest to the window would have been cramped a bit getting in and out of because of the armoire that is provided to hang clothes. The armoire is a plus, because i needed to hang clothes, but it sort of cramps the room. 5. Rooms are small. This is great for one person. Would be cramped with two at times and worse with a family. 6. Only really complaints I had was the bed wasn't the best (not the worst, either) and I had a strange reddish brown streak on the wall. I've reviewed another hotel on yelp and and that too had this weird streak. I got it off the wall using a wash cloth followed by a scorchingly hot hand wash, but it was sort of gross. Is this mark following me? Also keep in mind they may have rooms with more privacy or a bath, etc... Will stay again if I am in the area and need a lower cost hotel that is worth the stay.",positive
"When I arrived in Arizona my company booked my stay here. The front desk staff was friendly and always helpful, the shuttle drivers for fantastic- especially the driver who on my first night took me on a mini tour around Scottsdale after telling him this was my first time in Arizona; I really wish I could remember his name he was wonderful and my little mini tour felt like I was on a paid private tour..... I'm sure partly because he used to be a professional tour guide. My room was clean, the hotel itself was well taken care of. there were a few things that I felt could use some improvement especially considering the cost per night: The nightly refreshments were trail mix, chips & salsa, and I believe some little small crackers. The breakfast was so so... It appeared to be all ready cooked heat and serve ..I could be wrong. I skipped the breakfast except for my last day except for my last day and I tried it out, and I was underwhelmed. The pool towels were very small and thin..very thin like car wash towels. The washing machine needed a good cleaning. Because of the staff I would probably? stay again for an over night stay but the staff would be my only reason ...again the staff is awesome. Let me end this with saying by no means is this a bad hotel, it is clean and serves its purpose; just for me personally I feel for the price the hotel owners can do better.",positive
"My husband and I stayed 3 nights. Staff was exceptional, welcoming and friendly. Ice water and cookies always ready as you walk past the check in desk. Hot coffee always available as well, and coffee pots in room also. Bed was very comfortable. Dining area for the ""help yourself"" breakfast was so convenient, with nice choices of muffins, hot eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffle iron, yogurts, juices, butter, cream cheese, peanut butter....etc. We used the hot tub first night. Loved it but they have realized there is a crack and its leaking water underground so need to pull tub to fix....wasn't able to use the other 2 days but things happen. The shuttle was the best. We shuttled a few times back and forth to Westworld for the BikeFest. Shuttle was prompt every time...such a nice service if you want to go have a drink and not drive. I would definitely stay here again. Nothing flashy like a 5 star vegas hotel, but I give it 5 stars for having everything I needed, good staff, clean rooms, comfy bed, a wake up call, shuttle....and always friendly staff.",positive
"Clean hotel room, and very attentive workers. When I wanted to do a little local sight-seeing at the Musical Instrument Museum down the road, the lady at the front desk made several phone calls to arrange for me to get there and back in time for my airport shuttle ride. Very much appreciated - and the Sleep Inn transport was early to take me, so I got a few extra minutes! If not for the free shuttle (within five miles), I would not have gotten to see this awesome museum - and as a musician, it meant a lot to me. Thank you very much, Sleep Inn!",positive
"Bottom line - I slept well at a great price. Clean place and well-managed. Only gripe was wifi - it was very weak at best. Recommend if your looking for a good match of comfortable sleep and high affordability. Btw, Arizona is a beautiful place to visit, just sayin...",positive
"Our AC went out at our house in the beginning of June leading us to stay here for a night until we could get someone to fix it. We were frustrated coming in and we were welcomed with very nice, accommodating staff. The room was really nice and clean. We're very happy with what we got for a very reasonable rate!",positive
"The customer service offered by this establishment cannot be surpassed. The staff is attentive, friendly, and the value you get for your money in Pricey Scottsdale can't be beat!!!! If you or your family member is going to the Mayo Clinic or Scottsdale Healthcare Shea Campus this hotel is located near both plus first class dining and shopping.",positive
We had family stay here and they had a horrible experience. Rooms were very small and breakfast was awful. They had a huge soccer team of girls staying that were running down hallways. It's also next to a bar and there were people drunk in the parking lot. The service was pretty good but it was a bad place to stay. They moved next door to Hamptons Inn and liked it much better. They did appreciate being comp'd for their stay and for the free shuttle service.,negative
"We often stay at Choice Hotels and are generally very happy each time. Shay at this Sleep Inn is a superstar! She offered cold water upon check in. The next day, we happened to see her outside of our room. We asked if she had extra towels handy near our room. She said she didn't but she'd be happy to stop what she was doing to go get the towels. We told her we were on our way out to dinner and that we would stop by the front desk on our way back in for the night. We were gone a few hours because we met friends for dinner. Anyhow, we walked up to the front desk when we returned. Shay not only had the towels ready for us but she also said, ""I was afraid I had missed you."" The hotel was very busy that weekend we stayed. For her to remember us made us feel special. Way to go, Shay! You're amazing. Keep up the good work!! Also, this hotel had a cute ""Give one, get one"" library. Such a great idea for travelers to share books. I'd love to see more of these in Choice Hotels!!",positive
"Good morning, I am currently staying in one if your rooms. I'm so taken back by the level of service I have received. I couldn't help but to reach out. On behalf of the front desk agent who assisted me into getting into my room last night, Shay this morning at the front desk and Neil who shuttled me to my car... I had to let you know how wonderful they are. Each and every person has gone way beyond their duties to assist me. I had a horribly terrible night coming from Las Vegas. I was stranded, hysterically afraid and nervous. Your staff has done nothing more then make me feel right at home and feel safe. Your housekeepers are certainly doing there jobs as well because my room is immaculate. I'm very pleased to have gotten the opportunity, even out of misfortune, to stay here with you. I have worked the hospitality industry in Vegas my whole life and recognize a 5 star standard hotel from a mile away. It's a rare breed! I will make a great review any where you might request. I'm genuinely thankful and I hope you reward your staff for being such outstanding people. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU, Angel Fletvher Sent this to the corporate email. I think it says enough ;)",positive
"So we had to make an overnight trip to Thompson Peak Medical Center and needed a place to stay. We found the Sleep Inn was only a 7 minute drive from the hospital - a straight shot in a multi-lane boulevard. We decided to give it a go. The Sleep Inn has a North Scottsdale Road address but the best entrance is off of Frank Lloyd Wright Drive. Your GPS will take you past that intersection and have you turn into a back parking lot. You then have to drive through the Hampton Inn lot to get to the Sleep Inn. From SR 101, take N. Scottsdale Road to Frank Lloyd Wright, turn right at the intersection, you will see the CVS Drug Store. Turn left into the Sleep Inn parking lot right behind the CVS.... The lobby is right there. We ordered a room with a single king bed on the first floor. The wtaff was courteous and efficient. We got room 111. Perfect. The room was very clean and appeared to have been recently redecorated. The decor was tasteful and nicely done. The furniture was in excellent condition and the amenities included micro, fridge, flat screen TV, ironing board and iron, hairdryer, and coffee pot. The vanity and the shower had complimentary single use soaps, shampoo/conditioner and lotion. The bed linens were fresh and clean, as were the towels, and the bed was comfortable to boot. Oh, BTW, breakfast is included. It's pretty much the standard fare for these types of places, coffee, tea, milk, a host of juices, fruits, and yoghurts, a DIY waffle machine, boiled eggs, and cold cereal... With bagels, bread and muffins tossed in for good measure. Okay, so this is not the 5 star Taj Mahal.... You won't be in the lap of luxury - I will give you that, but with the special ""hospital"" rate they gave us, it is very much the right balance of convenient, clean, comfortable and cost effective. Should we ever return to this area, I would happily stay here again.",positive
"My husband is a Mayo patient and we have stayed at this Sleep Inn at least a dozen times since March 2015. Nothing but the very best of staff, breakfast, cleanliness, and very accommodating. I can't say enough good about this place and VERY AFFORDABLE. I would give more stars if there were more. THANK YOU!!",positive
Returned for a second stay and once again from Dennis at the front desk to all of the staff they were all so nice. Thanks Sleep Inn for the great service.!!!,positive
"We chose the Sleep Inn for our wedding hotel. They were extremely friendly and communicative with everything we needed: discounted rooms for our guests, shuttle service, welcome bags, etc. Great location and very affordable prices for all our guests. Thank you for being so helpful and easy to work with! Especially Danielle! They even went above and beyond and got us aspirin from a sister hotel at 6 a.m.",positive
"Resident ""management"" persons do not always have great ""people"" or ""problem solving skills"" and that seems to be problematic at this Sleep Inn from the reviews provided. When problems arise at a motel, consumer attitude is a major factor in what the outcome will be. If management decisions are not appropriate in the customers opinion, there is always someone above the resident manager to appeal and report to, that is why corporations own these hotels, the mom and pop days are gone and of course personal responsibility is also changing !",negative
"I absolutely love this hotel. When my boyfriend and I checked in they asked us if we wanted watered bottles, which was really nice. The look of the hotel was very pretty..when I walked into our room there was a light, nice smelling scent. The room is definitely cleaner than most hotels I've been to. The decor was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it! Oh and one more thing, we booked through Expedia so our one bed-room was only 40 dollars (tax included) for a Friday night. How cheap is that for such a nice hotel? Definitely go there!",positive
"I can see why this place has so many awards. Its a very well run choice brand hotel. The hotel itself constantly has this pleasant aroma from the moment I walked in to the lobby to the room itself. I have been checked in by different multiple front desk clerks and each time they all have been excellent. The staff here makes sure you feel welcome and that you have anything you need. The rooms itself all have microwave and fridges all in a built in work desk with a flat panel television. One big plus in my book is there are plenty of outlets everywhere. There are two outlet plugs in each lamp, with three lamps total in the room. This is helpful so i can have my laptop and phone plugged in at the work desk while my DS and other work phones can be plugged in by the bedside. There are plenty of restaurants just right down the road. In the afternoon, they had cookies available in the front lobby. There is always ice cold water available right by the elevators. The breakfast is 6am to 9am and is the standard breakfast items such as sausage patties, eggs, bread selections, waffles, yogurt, milk, juice, etc. They do have express checkout so you receipt will be under your room at night to make check out a breeze. SUMMARY Front Desk: 5 Check in/out Process: 5 Room Overall: 5 Bathroom Overall: 4 Breakfast: 4 Internet: 4",positive
"My experience here was..... well I guess I should explain.... At check-in, the gal was asking some personal questions to my friend as she was checking ID such as, ""why are you staying here if you only live down the street?"" and ""why are you staying for two night?"" etc... Those are all very personal questions, and very unprofessional if you ask me. This is a smoke-free hotel, but our room definitely reeked of cigarette odor(which triggered my migraines). But I didn't want to be an unpleasant guest and complain. And the rooms were quite small. However, the manager/lead of the shuttle and front desk was very pleasant. He was very easy to talk to, and very nice to let me know of their complimentary shuttle service. I mentioned the cigarette odor in the room and he quickly notated the account so that we wouldn't lose our deposit. I give him a 5 star alone for customer service. 1.) Would I stay here again.... no. 2.) Was it a horrible experience..... no.",negative
"Overall, a quality affordable hotel. The rooms were new and clean, and the staff was friendly. Complementary breakfast was okay too. Do not expect a four star hotel, but do expect a nice modern place to crash. Definitely one of the better value hotels in the area.",positive
Flew Spirit after Frontier canceled our flight for no reason. They sat us all together even though we called at the last minute. The head attendant was the best I've ever had on a flight. He made us feel comfortable and relaxed as he was on the speaker quite often. He joked with us and made everyone laugh. The other 2 attendants were very good as well. Everything went great without any problems at all. We were running late but the people at the Spirit check in were so helpful. We left on time which I can't say the same about Frontier flying down to Florida. We sat on the plane 45 minutes before taking off. I would recommend Spirit all day long!,positive
There is an old saying that you get what you pay for and this is true but this Airlines. Yes it is super cheap but that's about it. They want to charge you for everything when it comes to eating something because they do not give you complimentary anything on this flight. The worst part? The uncomfortable seating. The space is so small to where you cannot stretch out your legs and the seats do not go back or recline. The only saving grace is that they have good Pilots. But the flight staff along with the flight attendants need to be replaced. An absolutely horrible flight. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place or Airlines,negative
I bought 4 tickets for my family for my 50th birthday to go the beach I paid 500 dollars more for front Seat's they changed my flight to a different day and took my seat's it was hard to get a refund and I am still waiting to see if I did they ruined my birthday,negative
"Horrible customer service and policies. We had a flight booked to Ohio, they changed the departure time eight times and we couldn't accommodate the later flight so we called and told them we couldn't get on that flight and we took another airline. A week later we try to check in online for our return flight and can't find our flight. Turns out they canceled our flight home without telling us because we didn't get on the plan going there even though we called and told them. So called customer service and were told pretty much tough luck. Even thought it's there fault. No money back, no attempt to get us on another flight, not even a voucher for future travel. Not that we would ever fly Spirit again. There are other reasonably priced options, Spirit won't be one of them.",negative
"I got booked on this airline by Expedia. The worst customer service you can imagine. I had an issue with buying my bag allowance online and tried to call the so called customer service line. It was a recording referring me back to the website. No option to speak to a human. Called Expedia and the lady connected me to a number not available to the public. Waited 39 minutes to speak to someone only to be told I had to be transferred and then hung up on. Called again thru Expedia and got help after 45 min. Fast forward to the flight, it was fine and the staff very conscientious. After flight went to baggage claim where after 5 bags came out, the carousel stopped. No one to ask why, their office was closed !! Finally it resumed after 50 min. Thought the ordeal was over until a week later when I see fees I did not incur are on my bank statement. Disputing with my bank. One is a landing fee!!!! Never against i don't care how cheap their flights are. HORRIBLE!!",negative
"I recently flew round trip for the first time with Spirit.My flight was on time both ways and l had my boarding passes pre printed so l didn't have to pay for that. Our checked luggage was prepaid so the cost or them wasn't to bad in my opinion. The seats weren't spacious but l didn't feel cramped, I'm 5'7"". Overall, l have no complaints and I'd be willing to fly with them again. We even had extra carry ons (2 per person) on our way back home (souvenirs) that we didn't get charged for. All the staff members we encountered were friendly. Hopefully this experience was not a one time incident.",positive
For some odd reason Cleveland Ohio SPirit Airlines was on top of there game....3 out 4 gate agents were friendly!!! Just 1 needed Midol. I had some issues with my ticket because they used my old info on my spirit number & they wouldn't let me enter so I had to change my reservation to my current name....it sucks being Liz Taylor & having a dozen diff husbands but yolo!!! My next husband will have a private jet so I don't have to deal with commercial flying,positive
"Just read of Spirit's plan to shrink the size of their one allowed carry-on bag in order to make it necessary for more people to pay the significant additional fee to check their bags. Their marketing strategy has always been bait and switch. They lure you in with a truly low fare and once purchased bombard you with solicitations for additional services. Since everything must be done online, they take advantage of their captive audience to hard sell add-ons by making their customers weave through a maze of aggressive sales pages before a transaction can be completed. I recall on my last flight with them (and I do mean my last flight) I followed the instructions I received in an email the day before my flight. It informed me that I had to go online to get my boarding pass and select my seat. I did so and learned that pre-selecting a seat came at an additional charge that varied with the desirability of the seat. I was shown a seating chart that supposedly illustrated the available seats. It showed that roughly 80% of the seats were already assigned. Once I'd committed to paying for an assigned seat (in order to avoid the dreaded middle), an altogether different chart appeared. This one showed a flight with only about 25% of seats assigned versus the roughly 80% shown previously. I remember feeling like I'd just been conned. I'd been content to accept Spirit's model of budget travel with it's lack of frills. I can live without free drinks and peanuts. On a shorter flight I may even choose to accept the relative discomfort of less legroom and seats that don't recline. But you can't make me accept that and make me feel like a sucker too. At the end of the day, I'll choose to do business with a company that earns my trust and treats me with respect. Spirit Airlines does neither.",negative
"Spirit's Airbus A319 doesn't like cold weather. Water in restroom froze, and after a 1 1/2 hour delay, we're sent back to the gate due to a break light sensor flashing in the pocket. After another hour delay, we're now told there is a water leak somewhere on the plane. These delays have ruined my business trip. This airline is terrible, and I doubt I'll ever fly them again!",negative
"Please just die and go out of business your a disgrace to all forms of modern travel and service!!!!!! Never ever ever again I would pay triple and get less but be happy w food, bag, costumer service and a seat then this inhuman crap tube w wings!!!!",negative
"Worst airline. I am all about deals but it is not worth it. As a 5'5 130 lb woman, I had no space. They try to scam you on baggage and food/water. They aren't reliable on times. I WILL STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE FROM HERE ON OUT.",negative
"Can you give 0 stars?? This airline is a bait and switch operation that should be avoided at all costs! If you happen to get Vonda at the check-in window in Cleveland then good luck, she's a nasty piece of work herself who gets off on charging all those hidden fees. I hope this airline goes under and takes her with it! Thanks for nothing you nasty nasty woman.",negative
Terrible customer focus. This airline is a bait and switch operation. They make you pay for carryon bags AND checked bags--and their bag rates at the check-in counter are different then their bag rates at the gate! It's a total bait and switch. You buy a cheap ticket and think you are getting a deal only to be surprised at the airport. Never again!,negative
"To quote another review, ""they trick you into thinking you got a good deal."" Absolutely true. By the time you get done paying for EVERYTHING, your seat, bags, carry on's, you might as well have flown an airline you like, that you can log miles with. Don't let the advertised low airfares fool you, you will end up paying in the end and it will be just as much as a flight on a real airline. They fooled me once, it will not happen again.",negative
I have never once in my life bothered to write a review because it seemed like a waste of time. But that all changed today when I had to pay $10 for a 2x2 piece of paper (my boarding pass). I have been charged extra fees for everything imaginable so far while booking with spirit. I would not be surprised if I stepped on this plane in a few minutes and they charged me to breathe their air. thank you everyone and have a good day because I know I'm not.,negative
"If you dare to book on Spirit, be sure to have a backup plan. They delay and cancel flights much more than other airlines and they don't have many flights in any given day so if something goes wrong, you are going to be stuck. Seriously, have a backup plan! On the upside, there was a ticket agent who was great and sweet and made our situation a little friendlier. But our ordeal ended up costing two of us an extra $362 dollars and eight hours of vacation.",negative
"I never write reviews or post bad comments; that's not who I am or how I operate. If you provide me with good service or kindness I reward that with returning to do business with you and tell my family and friends about my experience! If you are rude; don't follow through on promises etc. then I never do butane with you again; bottom line I tell anyone who will listen why I won't go back to a certain place again. I want everyone who flies to know that Spirit Airlines may provide you with a cheap flight but that is all you will receive. My husband was offered two free round trip vouchers to anywhere including international flights, and so he stayed behind to allow a woman to return home to her son. When we called to book a flight using those vouchers we were told we were unable to use them during that time because we did not meet the class requirements; and when we asked for additional dates everything to everywhere was blacked out or unavailable???? Frustrating!!!! Yes and nothing was to accommodate our plans nothing was extended. The poor gentleman was like let me speak to my supervisor and we got nothing.",negative
"First and last time ever flying Spirit, which should change their name to huh?! Or wtf?! From having to buy a seat, to exorbitant prices for bags to delaying both flights I was on by 3 hours, spirit, you suck.",negative
Absolutely horrible. First flight was 2 1/2 hours late. Return flight home was delayed 2 hours then ultimately cancelled due to lack of flight attendants. After cancelling the flight we were all directed to the ticketing counter. After Being in line for 30 minutes we were given business cards and told the computer system went down so we'd all have to call for a refund or a new flight. When I finally got ahold of someone they refused to refund my money because they rescheduled me for the next day without my consent. Spirit offered no help with accommodations for the night. After arguing for 20 minutes I finally got my refund. I rebooked on Frontier and had great customer service. Never again will I book with Spirit,negative
"AVOID THIS AIRLINE !!! IDIOTS WORK HERE.... Our flight from CLE to MCO (Orlando) got canceled due to plane maintenance problems. No biggie, safety first. We did as we were told, return to the ticket counter and get a refund or get rescheduled. The workers at the ticket counter stated that they ""could not reschedule on another airline"" and the next flight we could get with them was two days laters (WTF). So we got a refund.... While getting our bags, I talked to other flyers and some of them got a third option (in the form of a business card), call a special # at Spirit airline # (801-401-2299) and they could reschedule on another airline. When we called - Since we cancelled our flight/ got our refund, they could no longer help us. When we talked to the manager at the ticket counter, she stated there was nothing she could do. Thank you spirit Airlines for screwing little kids Disney Vacation...NEVER AGAIN SPIRIT AIRLINES",negative
"NEVER EVER AGAIN! Spirit Airlines sucksssssssss. OMG! Totally not worth it. You think you're getting a Good deal because you see a flight for cheap. Think again, they make you pay $10- for your boarding pass ! Haha We had to wait in a line for 2 hours JUST to check our bag. Thank god we got to the airport early. Some people had little kids while standing in the line not enough people at the ticket counter to help check people in! Absolutely horrible. People were complaining and everyone was mad. We finally check in and get through security- run to the gate. Flight delayed. They told us the flight attendant never showed. Omg. We board the plane FINALLY. Get in our seats.... ummmm the tray isn't even a tray I couldn't fit my iPad on it! If you're someone who does work on your laptop while flying? Not on this plane!! So, I decide I'm going to close my eyes? I try to recline my seat? No can do. Not happening. Seats don't recline. You have to sit all stiff like a darn soldier or something. Want a glass of water? Nope. Zero. I didn't care about that though In my opinion, this company has the worst customer service Makes going away and flying a bad experience. I would rather pay more the deal with this. I just want to check in like normal airlines do, get on the plane, relax and get to where I going. I hated my Spirit experience. They aren't called the worst airlines for nothing.",negative
This was the worst expierence. Boarding was at 830. They didn't start till 920ish. They left the runway only to come back to the gate because of a bad radio. We sat there for 5 hours saw the stewards and stewardesses leave before they told us the flight was cancelled. And the next flight avaliable was 9pm the next day. I lost a vacation day. I can't wait to find out if I still have to pay for this day at the car rental place.,negative
Sat in row 1 and all was fine. Noticed flights are generally not full. I think a bottle of water could be given free. I could care less about snacks and a pop. All crew did was collect trash on the flight. Really don't work. I would fly again for the direct flight options.,negative
"If zero stars was an option this airline would get it. I understand that things happen such as delays and cancellations but the way it was handled by Spirit was unprofessional and not excusable. I have been on other airlines that had cancellations or delays and they handled it with more class and professionalism than Spirit by far. The customer service reps were rude and would make fun of customers, call them liars to their faces and then after our flight was cancelled she proceeded to yell at all the passengers talking to us like there was communication or even signs as to which line was which line. Then with her attitude stated everyone clear okay now Noone can say they didn't know. If you don't want to deal with customers then get a different job. As someone who works in customer service if I acted the way the manager and service reps did I would have been fired no questions asked. The updates we got about our flight were limited to the email alerts we got 2 updates from the reps in the 7 hours we were at the airport. Then they got mad when we asked for updates after nothing for hours. Our consolation prize was $7 food vouchers that we got after everything but dunkin donuts was closed, and we can't gurantee when you can get on a flight tomorrow or a we got a refund. Needless to say I didn't have to even think about rebooking I got a refund. I will not fly this airline again and will surely advise anyone that asks about it not to as well. You will find better service, more professionalism and certainly a better value on another airline. I really think that Spirit needs to rethink how their customer service reps and managers act if they expect to continue to have a company.",negative
"WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!! They cancelled our flight, told us we could take care of changing over our prepaid bags from the ticket counter the next day, then charged us an unconscionable amount and said we should have taken care of our bags the night before. Their business model is based on exorbitant hidden fees. I thought this pricing structure was worth it for short weekend trips when you don't need a lot of baggage, but I will never be flying with Spirit again. Update: The rebooked flight has not yet materialized. We are all waiting at the gate. There are no answers and no gate agents. Updated update: Ha! Wow! Does that baggage complaint seem trivial now!! The flight never happened. They told us that the reason for the delay was that the pilot was missing, but that was a lie - our fellow traveler talked to the pilot, who said that he was waiting for further instructions. It was a shame that they lied, because we all eventually had to rebook our flights. I found a one-way ticket on another airplane that was good enough based on where I was going for only $150 online, but I didn't get in time because I thought optimistically that this missing pilot would show up. It turns out that there was never a second aircraft that came to Cleveland to take us to Boston. Who knows what Spirit thought in terms of the realistic odds of our broken plane being fixed. The flight was canceled around 3. All of us passengers had to buy these insanely expensive one way tickets on other airlines in order to go home only one day after we were supposed to. The people who didn't panic and buy one way tickets got rebooked through United, paid for by Spirit, Monday morning on a flight that was supposed to leave Saturday night. The rest of us were stuck with our expensive one way tickets and fingers crossed that Spirit actually refunds us for the cost of the flight that never happened. Oh, and the baggage fees.",negative
"Cannot Be Rated!!!! It's Truly that BAD! Cheapest overall......BUT then you Have to pay for a Carry-on, assign seat, water, Everything Else......on top of that, it's like a bench seating, seats Do Not Recline, and No Cushion for Tush. Honestly, the overall cost would be the same as American, Delta, United, or any other. If you still plan on taking Spirit........Be Prepared for DELAYs and a Very Uncomfortable Flight.",negative
"As I am writing this, it is 7:15am and I am waiting for my daughter who's flight was to land at 6:45. I checked the Spirit web page for flight status before I left my home for the 40 min drive to airport, and it said ""on time"". I just called Cleveland Hopkins direct and they informed me that her flight is due in at 8:10am. Checked Spirits flight status again and still says ""on time"". My daughter texted me before she got on plane that her flight was 30 min late. So, I'm thinking since it said on time that they were ""making it up in the air"".........WRONG. I have read some bad reviews about Spirit and now I'm adding one more to Yelp. I would advise anyone picking someone up on a Spirit flight to tell them to take Uber. Agreeing with a previous reviewer, I would rate Spirit a major negative, but Yelp won't let me.",negative
"Update- The company has experienced a mass walk-off of pilots and other employees, resulting in mass cancellation of flights on 6/17/15. The company is in jeopardy and will likely not exist next week. I am going to tell it how it is. DO YOUR RESEARCH and understand what you're getting into. That's the best advice I can give. The hard honest reality - Spirit has no organization and they do not train their staff on courteous communication practices nor inform gate staff of aircraft issues. They are utterly disorganized and when you fly with them, your flight WILL be delayed. If you check stats on FlightAware, you will see for any given flight they have less than 25% on-time departures. Their weather policy is stricter than any other airline and will delay or cancel flights due to non-electrical precipitation. Such a delay will ripple thru the entire Spirit US network on a daily basis. These are the sacrifices one must accept when choosing to fly ""bare fare."" Do your research, be FLEXIBLE, and have an open mind. If you uphold this, you won't be unpleasantly surprised. Good luck to you, fellow Spirit travelers. May the odds be ever in your favor.",negative
"If i could give no star I would. The witches at the ticket terminal looked like they were smelling shit, and were totally rude. Granted there was nobody in line, and when we walked away from checking in our bag with tsa, they started acting like cheer leaders and pretending to be enthusiastic. This was on 5/17/2015, at 2pm. Totally unprofessional, have never had such uncourteous service.",negative
"I recently flew Spirit Airlines out of the Cleve in February. I love spirit so much for what it is, instead of being upset about what it isn't. It is a cheap airline and the seating rows are small so it's cramped. The try to trick you into paying more. Fly smart! Food and drinks are extra. Bring an empty water bottle through security and fill it. You pay extra for checked baggage. You pay extra for carry on. You get 1 personal item which can be a pretty full student size backpack that has to fit under your seat. You have to pre-pay your bags. If you don't and show up with a carry on its like 100$ be smart! Read ahead! Sometimes they are late - they don't care! It's just cheap flights. Instead of the more usual 50lbs for a checked bag its 40lbs. I love them. The amount of times I've flown for less and 25$ each way?? Too many to count. I've flown out of detroit and Latrobe, but now they have the CLE new in 2015 so that was very happy news for me. If you have a problem with spirit air and you need to complain?? Just tell it to your pillow. I've called them - they really don't care. Love you spirit! Hate you spirit! Their facility at Cleveland is fine. Nothing much to say about it. I think my flight actually was on time for once.",positive
"Stayed here for one night with my family during the summer. I have stayed at several other nearby similar hotels...with Hyatt Place being our former favorite. I can tell you that SpringHill Suites blows the others away. In fact, I'm kind of angry I didn't discover them sooner. The Pro's: * Super friendly staff * Super clean rooms & hotel * Great complimentary breakfast! * Free popcorn, cookies & coffee * Larger mini-fridge in rooms The Con's: * Shower needs a sterilized mat inside * Our bathroom was very dark. Poor lighting. * No bar in the hotel ;) Everything else was great. We tried the pool at night. Very comfortable and our kids loved our stay. Would and will stay here again.",positive
"Well so far my stay here isn't a pleasant one the ""nonsmoking"" I was given reeks of cigarette smoke. It's so strong my wife is having trouble sleeping and is getting a headache from it. I should have checked it earlier but I went to my brothers house after I checked in and didn't get back until after 1am. I called the 500 number they have for after hours and was told that there wasn't anything that could be done that I have to wait until 8am when the front desk opens again. This is unacceptable I asked for a non smoking room for a reason and to get one that smells like someone was smoking in here for months is ridiculous. I hope that when they open in the morning they will accommodate us for this.",negative
I have high expectations for hotels and am routinely disappointed. This experience lies somewhere in the middle. I arrived really late at night and was greeted by a friendly host at the front desk. All employees I interacted with were very friendly. The morning breakfast was typical and totally acceptable. It was really busy so things were a little in need of replenish but they staff was working hard. I have no problems here. The hotel seemed clean fro the halls to the room I had. This is a slightly older hotel so the rooms are a little smaller than I am used to at a Springhill. Maybe could use a little updating. The beds were comfortable,negative
"One of the best!!! Where do I begin?? We have now stayed at 2 different SpringHill Suites and have had nothing but a wonderful experience. Since I am a wheelchair user I require an accessible room. I can find good rates on the net but need to call and confirm how the room is set up. Once I know the room will fit my needs I will make the reservation and try to get the internet rate or close to it. The young man who took my reservation said he would match the internet price. Whereas when I called the nearby Hyatt they wanted to charge me $25 more. They didn't get my business. When I made the reservation I requested an early check-in since I would be dropping off my car for repairs early in the morning. When we got to the hotel 9:30am and gave them my name they said our room was ready. I was impressed. They gave us a little goodie bag of water and cookies. Most hotels want to sell you the water. The room was very spacious and brite. Had frig & microwave. There was also a nice couch hide-a-bed. The bathroom was very roomy and easy to navigate. The only negative was the shower. While it was a roll-in shower with shower seat there was no way a person sitting on the seat could reach the control and shower head. Someone wasn't thinking that day. The room was very clean and comfortable. Had a great night's sleep on the king bed. It was very quiet also. The morning breakfast is more than just coffee and rolls. They had scrambled eggs, Canadian bacon and sausage patties. There was real made hot oatmeal with a number of items you could add to it from fruit to nuts. There was bread items like English muffins, bagels, croissants, muffins and bread. There was orange and apple juice plus milk & yogurt. You could even make a waffle. Yes there was hot coffee and tea available. In the past 14 months we had occasion to book 4 different hotels and can truly say Springhill Suites gave us the most enjoyable stay. We have paid more and got less at other places. Yes we do recommend Springhill and will book them again when needed.",positive
"Location: About 15 minutes away from the downtown Phoenix with free on-site parking; however, the hotel location is not so intuitive because of the one-way local street entrance (easy to drive in, a slight hassle to drive out). You will need to drive to grocery stores because they are not within 5 minutes of walking distance. Price: About $75 per night (with tax and other fees) for the 2 Queen Suite with a sofa bed. Room: Clean bathroom with a high pressure shower head, comfortable sofa bed (very easy to pull in and out the bottom deck of the sofa bed), free WiFi (I had to walk downstairs and ask for the password), and strong A/C (can set the temperature as low as 65 ¬∞F - that's awfully cold). Other amenities: A small fitness gym (treadmills, elliptical machines, and a dumbbell rack), a small pool, free popcorn + coffee + hot water with tea bags at the lobby, and complimentary breakfast. Honestly it was a surprisingly comfortable stay ... minus the strong A/C which was out of my control due to other folks adjusted the temperature during the middle of the night (in football teams battle for field position ... I had to battle for the temperature control).",positive
"The best hotel experience I've ever had! To start, the front desk area has coffee and teas with all the trimmings, a popcorn cart, cookies, and even lollipops all throughout the day, a welcomed sight after hours of travelling. A clean room is non-negotiable for me and this hotel delivered. Every inch was spotless, including the inside of the large mini-fridge, microwave, and kitchen sink. The room amenities were outstanding, plugs and outlets for every cable imaginable, and a quiet a/c. Excellent shower, large computer desk. The breakfast was outstanding- eggs with spinach and salsa, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, breads, bagels, delicious fresh cut fruits, yogurt, variety of milk, juices, and waffles. There are no vending machines which I was initially disappointed about. However, there are well stocked shelves by the front desk with a wider variety of snacks and drinks than a vending machine. Also has frozen meals for in-room microwaves. During our stay, I noticed my girlfriend's ring was missing. We looked all over the room for it with no luck. After my girlfriend made an initial report I went to speak to Ashley at the front desk. She was pleasant, good eye-contact, and didn't respond like she didn't care or ""ass-kissy"". The manager, Tana, found our ring in a vacuum AND to make us feel at ease she said the top housekeepers would be tending to our room for the remainder of our stay. Can you believe this service?! I will be returning to Phoenix in December or January and although this hotel will not be centrally located for me, I probably will stay here again.",positive
"Hotel is centrally located and right off I-17. Price was fair for a small hotel but as a national chain I have stayed at before this one was below par. Room was not good. Carpets where filthy, outside shade was torn...not enough drawer space. Outside shade was inadequate to keep light out in the morning. Ceiling was very thin as you could hear people walking upstairs. Bedding was OK and could have been newer and they needed more of it. Breakfast was good but staff did not replenish quick enough. Staff was friendly.",negative
"If you are looking for budget lodging, this is an excellent choice. The rooms are not fancy, but they have been upgraded. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious (for one person), and the microwave was a bonus. The breakfast buffet has an impressive selection, including several healthy options. What makes this property superb is its staff from the general manager down to the front desk clerks. Everyone I encountered offered a big smile and went above and beyond to fulfill my requests. You'll have a good night's sleep and your wallet will thank you.",positive
We stayed here earlier this month and it was really great. We came in at 4 a.m. after a long drive and the lady at the front desk was very accommodating. I commend her for being so nice and alert at 4 a.m.! There were some stains on the floor of our room but for the price it was still definitely worth it. The fitness center was small but that was okay because I got it all to myself when I was there. Every employee I encountered was very nice & professional. I would definitely stay here again.,positive
"Stayed here the first night of our trip. Very nice huge spacious room. Clean, Paul Mitchell products, and my husband liked the shower. No complaints here and a very friendly staff. Definitely recommend.",positive
"Stayed 3 nights. When I made the reservation, I asked for 1 room with doubles because we were traveling with kids. When we showed up, we had to take 2 rooms because they over-booked doubles. Husband went out early and cleaned our car windshield. Couple hours later when we went out to the car our windshield was broken. Went to the front desk and was told the manager would get back to me. Never happened. Breakfast was ok, if you don't mind waiting since everything ran out pretty quick. Will never stay again.",negative
"Stayed here four nights while in town for a family reunion. We stay at Marriott hotels almost exclusively and were a bit disappointed with this location. While our room was clean, the term ""suites"" was used very loosely. There was one very small drawer to hold our clothes. The closet consisted of a 3 foot rod in an open area with about 8 hangers. The bed was very comfy but remained unmade one day while we were there, even though we were out of our room all day. Complimentary breakfast was standard. They were out of bottled water every day. Lots of sodas and vitamin water but no plain water. They did offer a water dispenser with small cups if you wanted to make the trip downstairs when you were thirsty. I don't think I would recommend unless you had no other options.",negative
"On our road trip across the country, we took a chance along the way stopping wherever we needed a break without reservations. Excellent welcome from front desk when we arrived. The suite with two queen beds was great for all three of us. Clean, modern, GREAT BED. Breakfast had some hot items - bacon and eggs. Would stay there again.",positive
The best hospitality service ever!!! Fahad (front desk) was the most accommodating and the friendliest of all. The hotel was clean and well maintained! Fahad and Josh let us party in their lobby the four nights during our stay! They made our stay a 5 star experience!!! Thank you so much for all your help!!,positive
"This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future.",negative
"Our stay at this this hotel was one of the worst ever. I have never written a negative review or even made a complaint, but SpringHill Suites was a great disappointment. We were in Phoenix for a big family get together over Thanksgiving, and I wanted a nice pleasant place for (the three) of us. No such luck. Check-in was fast and cheerful. That's as good as it got. Upon entering our room, we found the dresser had been removed leaving an empty space where it wasn't, and allowing nowhere to put our (non-hanging) clothes. So we had to live out of our suitcases. Well, I don't like to complain about trivial matters, so I said nothing. The next day - Thanksgiving - we left the room at about 11:00 AM and returned at about 9:00PM. The room had not even been made-up. I finally found the desk clerk, and told him. His response was ""Oh, housekeeping is gone for the day."" ""Anything else?"" ""Yeah, how about some towels? All ours are wet on the floor."" "" For how many?"" ""Three."" ""Okay, I'll bring some,"" He didn't. And out room was the closest to the desk, about 25 feet. Finally at about 10:00 my wife went to get them herself. Later I opened the sofa bed, finding it unmade and when open, only a few inches from the TV stand. I squeezed through the space -- bad mistake. A hidden steel projection put a gash in my leg, right through my pants. Good thing I had some band aids, as it was bleeding. The next morning upon checkout, I ""dragged"" the young female clerk away from her personal conversation with another employee, and could sense her annoyance. Told her about all the problems encountered during our stay, and all she could say was ""Oh, sorry."" ""That's it? Guess I'll have to write a very negative report on this place, and complain to the Marriott management."" With that she made a ""pffff"" sound, turned her back, and resumed her conversation. Well, I was annoyed with the deficiencies, but really pissed with their attitude. During an email exchange a couple of days later with the asst. manager, he blamed us for the absent maid service, saying our ""do-not-disturb"" sign was out. That sign was taken in when we left at 11:00, and the maid saw us leave -- she was in the hall just two doors down. And in all of this, not one of them even bothered to ask if my leg was all right. The ""problems"" were bad enough, but their indifference really steamed me. If you still choose to stay here, don't say you weren't warned.",negative
The staff is very friendly and the rooms are so cute. We were staying down the road at comfort suites but the room was smaller for double the price. This place just has a much better vibe!,positive
"you'll probably never stay at this location, because there are so many places downtown to check in to, but i have enjoyed my stay at the springhill suites and have found their staff both nice and very understanding. i came in late and the front desk agent was quick with the key and wished me well as she told me about breakfast and internet options. in the morning i enjoyed a ""continental breakfast plus"" (some hot options) and the dining area in the lobby has a great room feel and a very nice flat screen tv. there is also a front porch with a few dining tables and it's shady and catches a breeze which became a perfect lunch spot for me and my salad. i was granted a late check out so i sunbathed by the pool, waded around in it for a while and generally sweated. a lot. there is also a small gym with a treadmill, bike and elliptical which i did not use but looked at intently as i passed by. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the air conditioning was on and the kitchenette was perfect for my 1 night/1 day stay. best of all, even though i checked out at 2PM, they held my luggage while i did some touring, and now at 9 they continue to let me use their facilities while i wait for my ride who is approximately 5 hours late. without them i would literally be on the streets.",positive
"My family and I spent 7 weeks at this hotel while we were relocating to Arizona. Yaseen, who is one of the managers, was wonderful. He was professional, courteous and if we needed something, he was very responsive. Russel who works at the front desk was awesome. Russel helped us resolve a question. The cleaning ladies were very sweet. You're walking distance from Arizona Mills and very nice shops. I recommend this hotel.",positive
"I have stayed here on two separate occasions when traveling to the Phoenix area for spring training. Both times, the stay was pleasant and relatively comfortable. The rooms were clean and I always felt safe, which are my two priorities when staying in a motel. Obviously, this is a Motel 6, so I don't know why people are surprised to find that the towels are thin or anything like that; maybe they should be staying at the Marriott for $200+ a night. The location is convenient for pretty much anything in the East Valley: malls, restaurants, etc. I feel that this property is an excellent value for the money, especially considering that Tempe can be an expensive place to stay.",positive
"Ok the photos posted by people previously do NOT do this place justice! I was moving cross country and came across this place on a google search looking for a safe clean place that won't break my bank. I was greeted by Jeffery. He was professional and polite. He answered all of my questions (I had several). He gave me the same service that I get at a Hilton. I wasn't sure what to expect but when I opened my door, the room was super modern. New vinyl hardwood floors. Modern curtains and bedding. Furniture matched the decor. I was very impressed. So much! I had to write a review. This place is not getting the credit it deserves. Great value. Thank you I enjoyed my stay.",positive
"Stayed a weekend here, staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was very clean. I would recommend it! It is very conveniently located !",positive
"I travel a lot & this is the worst place I have ever stayed. The bed sheets, bathroom, & kitchen towels were all dirty. The bathroom had nasty stains on the walls & rust in the tub. I had to change rooms after the first night because the power went out at 10:30 pm & never came back on. Since the office was closed I couldn't get another room until the next day. The new room had electricity but was just as dirty as the previois room. It smelled like cigarette smoke. The floor was dirty too. The only good thing I can say is that the tv worked & they had cable.",negative
The manager is a complete bitch. The staff is not accommodating what so ever. The room has bugs and stinks like smoke. The toilet had a big shit in it when I checked in. They brought me new towels but they were dirty. I would never ever recommend anyone book this hotel,negative

"*For the bar While looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening. Just getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout. I browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. It was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus. I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9. It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.",negative
"So I always heard good things about Sunnyledge but never stopped in until I went there my junior year at CMU. Biggest mistake of my first 2 years. And yes, I had a fake ID so I could get into most places. Well, Sunnyledge is kind of a bed and breakfast type lodging but on Fridays from 6-8, they have their happy hour. 1/2 price Martinis. These martinis are unbelievable. They are pretty strong and taste delicious. They have so many different martini's on their menu so just choosing one/two/three/four will take a bit of time to decide each time you re-order. So the martini comes in a regular martini glass. Well, you also get the leftover martini mix poured into a small glass container. They put dry ice in your glass before they pour your drink so the drink actually starts to bubble and puff up whisps of smoke which is so cool. There is also a larger piece of dry ice in your glass container which keeps your extra martini cool until you're ready to drink it. Once your finished the first glass, you pour what's in the container into your martini glass and voila, it comes out to a second martini. Granted that these martini's are kind of expensive, on half price happy hour, you are pretty much getting 2 martini's for the price of one. They also have a free tiny buffet appetizer where they have different things each time. I've had cheese and crackers, bruschetta, cole cuts crackers and cheese, etc.. The menu isn't too bad either. I had their duck wrap and sliders one time. The fries were different. Not bad. but not exceptional. The only issue I have with the food is that the servings are really small and aren't worth the money you spend on it but if you go there on an empty stomach and end up ordering 4 martini's (8 total drinks) then you will need to get something to eat.",positive
"All the previous reviews on here are for dining, what about the hotel? I stayed 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday. Nice hotel! It is a grand old mansion built circa 1886 and designated an historic landmark. Definitely an old school hotel, there is internet and basic TV, rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless. The place has a certain charm to it. If you like your hotel to be quiet, quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay. Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh. The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880's and makes for pleasant walking. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Would have been 5 stars if I had my own coffee maker in the room, but the staff is always ready to being you a carafe for no charge, I just prefer to wake up and not have to dress to go for my first coffee....",positive
"Who deleted my review of Sunnyledge? Back in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge. We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu. When we arrived there, however it was a different story. We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there. We shrugged it off and went to the bar. The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants. And that's saying something. The bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen. Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around. It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on. We were there for about 2 hours and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times. Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen. Even when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card. Terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place. I have no plans on returning. I hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper. I have the means, I have the will.",negative
"I only go here for the martinis. I've never had the food. The bar is an excellent cozy place that works for couples and groups. There is an assortment of non-traditional martinis. The prices are extremely reasonable($8 for a very generous martini) and the staff is excellent. The only sad thing is they have Hendricks gin, but never any cucumbers. The nice thing about martinis here is that they fill your glass and then give you a mini carafe of more martini in a round bowl full of ice to keep it cold.",positive
"As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse. Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience. It's funny how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh. I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list of things I wanted to do before leaving. The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas. Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch. The 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud. The brunch came with an entree and a buffet. I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it. I had a lobster club sandwich which was great. The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small. Caviar. Small pastries. Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory. Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food). The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped. I had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet. But this was a small negative compared to my experience at Sunnyledge. I hear that Sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay. Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I would like to try out the boutique hotel. But until then, I would highly recommend this brunch.",positive
"We stayed here for four nights. It's an okay hotel for what it was. The boyfriend was the one that dealt with the front desk staff and it was hit or miss depending who was there. When we arrived on a Wednesday night whomever was there was apparently quite pleasant. Another woman seemed a bit disinterested in being there or even being very helpful when he went to tell them our refrigerator wasn't working. She did call about the refrigerator, of course. Later, a nice man brought us a new refrigerator. That refrigerator lasted for a few hours then was warm. I'm not sure if they have terrible refrigerators or if it's an electrical issue. Our first day we left the room housecleaning was in the room across from us. As she saw us leaving she pleasantly asked if there was anything we needed. The room itself was clean enough. The hallway smelled a bit like cigarettes, but this smell was not in the room. Can't speak for room service, continental breakfast or housekeeping as we used none of it. I like that Sheetz is right next door.",negative
"I had a completely horrible experience, NOT WORTH IT! BED BUGS! BED BUGS! BED BUGS! I woke up covered in bites and possibly brought them back to my own home. To make matters worse, the owner did not seem surprised that I had been bitten and was not apologetic at all. I wish I would have paid more money to stay at a clean hotel, because now I am paying for it ten fold!",negative
"A nice stay for a great price. The room smelled fine and was very clean. Some Motel 8 motels have a lot of noise from the highway, but not this one. There are fast food restaurants next door and more within driving distance. We would not hesitate to return.",positive
"What a pleasant surprise after out 2 day stay at thus Super 8! Super clean rooms, friendly staff, beds and pillows that were more comfortable than the ones I have at home. Brand new fridge in the room and microwave. Even the coffee in the rooms was good. Added plus is that the city water though hard tastes great. Walking distance to Cracker Barrel across overpass where we had breakfast both mornings. They even have a wee breakfast nook at check in with coffee, oj, cereal. Would definitely stay here again.",positive
"Cheap and Clean hotel. Has a small breakfast bar, and the young man behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. Stayed for one week and had no problems. Great stay with Great Value.",positive
Stayed here for my friends birthday party! Of course we had too much fun but the hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful.,positive
Really??? Locals rule??? Really? This is a joke. I cannot understand how a place can say say this when I spend literally 10 k every 3 months here. I've lived here for 20 years. Locals don't rule ...80 year olds with oxygen tanks rule here!,negative
""" O"" my! Read my other reviews & you'll see I'm all about service. Orange Sky is stunningly beautiful. I've been for dinner several times. I think I gave it 5 stars. So tonight. 9pm on a Tuesday in June in AZ... Place is literally empty. We came in, sober, from a business event & ...",negative
"This is the best casino in Arizona . This is the Wynn of Las Vegas ! Great food, very clean rooms, and jackpots !!!!!!!!!!",positive
Beautiful place for a baseball game. The fields are fun during spring time and worth a visit during spring training. Just one problem is they charge for parking when there is a whole mall right next door. Save some bucks and walk a little from the mall,positive
"While the hotel offers fabulous dining, dancing and entertainment options, the biggest complaint I have is the window coverings in the hotel rooms. Adorned with 4 inch plantation shutters, the sunlight penetrates into the room at 6am! No blackout drapes or options for a tighter closure. So, enjoy the evening of partying and expect to wake up at the crack of dawn.",positive
"My wife always wins here! We eat and then play. She always gets back our meal and then some. So it is like eating great for free! There is also 7 restaurants onsite.

They have not been reviewed or approved by Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort.",positive

"I'm not sure what star rating go give this resort This is my second time staying at the resort .. First time was great ..no issues.. This time great as well but as I'm trying to enjoy my dinner with my mother that I I haven't seen in a while we were approached by 8 security officers stating we didn't pay our bill in the cantina for $53 mind you were saying at the hotel and when we did eat at the cantina in the morning we specifically told our waiter to Bill our room . The manager Harry came to our table after the incident and apologized for the approach he was very nice and we had a very nice long conversation on how his employees handled the situation As a general manager my self it was very good that the general manager too the time to come over and sit down taking the time to have a discussion on the situation At the end of the day I'll come back but by dinner was ruined and not once was I offered any type of discount or credit for the inconvenience .. I am more disappointed in this resort more and more I have had 4 calls from "" managers"" all asking me the same question on what happened not know that the other "" manager "" has contacted me I don't have time for several calls wasting my time doing me what happened It's so sad that with such a big resort type hotel they have employees in Managment positions that don't know how to gather proper information prior to calling a customer Very unorganized and still people's not resolved after 4 calls Unbelievable",negative
I recently gave a somewhat negative review. Just want to say hotel management quickly responded to our complaints. Am very happy with the resolution. Would definitely recommend and visit again. Thanks Talking Stick!!!,positive
"I've never had a worse experience at a casino before. And no I'm not talking about gameplay. This place has no idea how to treat a customer. Bad customer service, bad food, overpriced and bad customer service... Did I say that already? Sorry but I can't overemphasize it. Pitboss' should not make you feel like crap when you lose or show disgust when you win. She was probably fired from a good casino at some point. Food is overpriced and not good in taste. Rooms are nice but still overpriced. Overall, I'd say I would rather sleep in my car and bring a box of crackers.",negative
"Can't get the Internet working, the room smells like they are covering up a horrible accident, and my phone says welcome Mr Adam Morales....oh and it's 450 a night. I gave it two stars cause the staff rocks but corporate needs some serious retrofitting.",negative
"Fun place to come and gamble. They have all the machines to play as well as blackjack and a large poker room. They also have a nice pool where they throw parties during the summer on the weekends. They also have some nice restaurants that serve some interesting tasty food. One of my favorites is ocean trail. They make different types of stews, bisques, etouffee and jambalaya.",positive
"I had a really good experience this past weekend at this resort. We went to the pool party on Saturday, which was very fun. Good music, the servers have excellent service and always made sure our cocktails were refreshed. - Ate at Blue Coyote and the service was really good. Plus the food we ordered was all delicious. - Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Definitely a great staycation. Will be back here for sure.",positive
Rooms are awesome. We always get a great room with a huge bathroom/shower. Casino is fun and the bars and restaurants are a blast! Pool is very dirty and their parties attract a very trashy crowd! Not impressed with that! We always have a good time though!,positive
Spend $140 a night. But don't try to bring a coffee cup down to the casino. because they won't let u. Good luck with that concept,negative
"Summer Concert Series***Very Poorly Executed** We bought good seats to see ZZ Top. I have seen then in concert before. The chairs were so close together you couldn't even move you legs. The sound was awful. So the state of the art sound system they say, Not existent. I really felt taken, gypped. The concert was less than an hour. Yes I get it they are old, should have had an opening band. I'm not blaming ZZ top, I don't think Talking Stick has the expertise to put on these concerts. They need professional help.",negative
"Hotel was nice and the room was very nice. When they say check in is at 4, they really mean it. The casino floor was very smokey and just walking through made my hair stink. The pools looked really nice, but I didn't have a chance to enjoy them.",positive
"We booked a room for 2 nights for our wedding so that the guys would have somewhere to get ready during the day, and we would have somewhere nice to stay on our wedding night. I thought I got a decent deal on Hotwire but I wish I'd just coughed up a little more money to stay somewhere else. Unfortunately, February in Phoenix is $$$ at other nearby resorts and I didn't feel like I could justify that. Pros: room looks pretty nice and had a nice view of the pool. Check in was super fast. Shower is pretty nice. Room service was fast, fairly tasty, and not horribly expensive. I've stayed here before for a pool day and used the room for drinking, showering etc and that was fine. Cons: WORST BEDS EVER. The sheets felt like plastic, the mattress was very hard, the pillows were way too thick and not soft. We didn't sleep at all, and that's with a guy who can fall asleep almost anywhere. Maybe that is their plan so you give up and go gamble instead? The bathroom door does not close all the way - even fully closed, there is still a good one inch gap between the door and the frame. A little awkward with more than one person in the room. There is also no fan in the bathroom. Bottom line, for a hotel that's billed as a 4-star resort, I would expect a lot better. I was really disappointed that I chose this for our wedding night, and I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants to sleep.",negative
"Casual Sunday night just looking to have some beers after the Super Bowl when we were fortunate to meet Sarah our amazing bartender! Quick service, water, fresh cold glasses for our beer but most importantly she was awesome to talk to. Highly recommend the Orange Sky Lounge especially if Sarah is your bartender!",positive
"Perhaps I'm just not used to Indian Casinos, being from Reno I have a certain expectation for casinos having been around them my whole life, that said.... I did not enjoy this place. I have gone there twice now and experienced that same dussapointment. Its extremely crowded, there is rarely an open machine or table. The tables are all way over priced and there are strange suspicious characters everywhere. If you can manage to get on a machine, no doubt someone will come and hover over you until you are so creeped out you surrender the machine. The payouts are lousy and the food (we at at the cafe downstairs) was underwhelming. Also its one of the only smoke friendly places you can go so its basically a giant ashtray - I reeked when I got homem . Just not a good time.",negative
"Me and my wife stayed here the night we got married because she wanted to see the view the next morning. Let me just start off by saying the view is the only ""nice"" thing about this hotel. A couple of days before our stay I called and asked for a bottle of champagne and some chocolates to be waiting in my room when we got there and told them exactly what time I was going to be there which they charged me for right then and there. Of course it wasn't in the room so I called down and asked them to bring it. They brought it up on their own sweet time and when they did they brought 2 bottles and 2 orders of chocolates and then charged me again for both! Trying to argue with the front desk about money was like talking to a wall so I said screw it and just paid for it 3 times. The actual room was set up nice and everything looked good until you looked closely. Blood stains on the pillow cases and bed sheets, hair everywhere in the room, the shower drain was clogged so if you had the shower on for more than maybe 5 minutes it overflowed onto the bathroom floor and onto carpet. No complimentary breakfast, the layout of the whole building is annoying, you have to walk All the way through the casino to get to the hotel. I would not recommend this ""resort"" to anyone and I will not stay here again",negative
"I'm giving this place one stare because I can't go any lower on yelp. The short version, The staff was rude, took forever to get drinks, very smokey, and the valet returned my car dirty! The long version, I just got married and this was the place my wife and I stayed after the wedding. After we get there the lady can't find our reservations. She was very rude even tho I was in a tux and my wife was in her wedding dress. She kept walking away from us without saying a word, and returning without saying a word. After I basically had to do her job for her, she found our reservations. This took about 25 minutes to do. After we got our room key she didn't ask if we needed help with our luggage! The next day my wife and I went to a movie and then hung out by the pool. We sat there for about 45 minutes hopping one of the many servers walking by would serve us. Needless to say, they didn't. I had to walk to the outside bar myself to get drinks. Since my hips are messed up from my time in the army, and I walk with a limp; I thought it would be a good idea to get us doubles so I wouldn't have to make as many trips. They could only give me one double at a time. So I ordered my wife's drink, limped back to our seats. Gave my wife her drink, and limped back to the bar to get my drink. My wife made the next trip, ordered the exact sand drinks and she got charged less money. Later that night we decided to do a little gambling. The casino was overly crowded and way too smokey. There ceilings are very high and when we looked up at the lights we could literally see clouds of rolling smoke. We decided to go back to our rooms early. The next day when we left the valet gave us our car back dirty. Looks like they parked it next to a sprinkler. I mentioned it to the valet manager and he assured me that it rained the night before. I checked the weather and it did not rain. They blatantly lied to my face!! The next day we checked our bank account, only to find that they had charged us for the room. This was very odd since I payed cash in advance and had a receipt to prove it. I called a couple of times and was assured that the charge would be reversed. Two weeks, and many phone calls later, I had to drive back there before I actually got my money back. I will never go to this place ever again! If I ever have the urge to go to a casino, I will drive the six hours to Las Vegas. The long drive is worth a good experience.",negative
"Well, this place did it's job! It entertained me, got me drunk, and took all my money. Somehow I still had a BLAST here and can't wait to go back. The rooms were big, clean and well done. I honestly have nothing bad to say about the hotel rooms, or any of the service. It is a upscale casino compared to some of the other ones here in town. The casino area got kind of packed and I wish they had more black jack tables there. It was kind of disappointing to have to stand around for 30 minutes waiting for a table to open up. I understand that the slots is their money makers but more tables wouldn't hurt. NOW....about the pool....The pool is a party in its self. There was a DJ playing some music, not my type of music, but it was the kind that got the girls up and moving if you know what I mean. So for that and being dressed in bathing suits the DJ was a hit in my book. I believe that this is a every Saturday event that you should check out. The pool is big enough where you are not right on top of the guy next to you, and the service at the pool was good. The drinks are expensive, but still worth it. Don't be that guy or girl at the pool without a drink in your hand. The bar area was nice and the line never got to bad. I was impressed with the Talking Stick and would highly recommend it. For sure one of the top casinos in Arizona.",positive
"This is our go to place for summer staycations. My husband likes to play poker and I like to play slots once in a while and this fills both our needs. The buffet is pretty good, not quite the same standards as Vegas but good for az. The rooms are always clean and have a modern decor. The complaint that I don't like about the rooms is that they are not very well insulated, every time we stay here we have crazy noisy neighbors and you can hear every word they are saying, every time some opens and shuts the door.. Guess what you can hear it. Oh well we don't really have anything else like it in scottsdale so we will prob keep coming back here for cheap staycations",positive
"the rooms here are so beautiful and nice. the sheets are crisp and clean and the room itself was just so spacious. the bathrooms are so modern but the sliding door that doesn't close completely could lead to some embarrasing bathroom moments if you're not completely comfortable with your hotel mate! our room overlooked the east valley mountains and the party pool below. but the party stops around 5pm so no need to worry about that noise. what i go totally annoyed with was the hallway noise. it's like the wall is suddenly made of paper. from midnight to 3am, drunkards kept us awake yelling and hollering as they made their way back to their rooms. it's completely annoying and today i am exhausted from only a few hours of sleep. it would have been so nice to have a restful night sleep on their uber comfortable beds. i understand it's a casino and a party scene, but i've slept in quieter rooms on the strip in vegas. the place gets 5 stars for it's design beauty and because my wife put so much effort in my birthday weekend. 2 stars for so much NOISE!",positive
The buffet at Talking Stick resort puts other buffets to shame. The food is always fresh and of great quality. There's always an assortment of cheeses and meats. Different international themes ranging from Asian to Mexican to Italian foods The desert bar is exceptional boasting everything from gelato to various pies and cakes. The service is always great- and like any true casino has Keno available. We spend many special occasions at this buffet.,positive
"Stayed there last night and had a great time. The room was extremely nice, I am jealous that it's not how my room at home is. Very new, clean and comfortable. Amazing bathroom with waterfall shower. The lighting in the room was great too. I had a nice view of the pool and the south course behind. My only complaint is I had no idea how to call the front desk with the nice new phone system they had. Also, what ever happened to bathroom doors that actually shut so there is a little privacy? This sliding doors don't make any sort of a seal and don't give much privacy. I love how the pool and hot tub area is open 24/7 and they give you complimentary water rather than the usual $5 bottles at most places. Nice little touches. I look forward to going back some time soon. The cigar lounge downstairs is fun. Orange Sky, the restaurant upstairs is very good. I never win at gambling so I won't comment on the tight slot machines ;)",positive
"I'm left with a very bad taste in my mouth after a recent stay at Talking Stick Resort. My family and I decided to surprise my Parents with an Executive Suite for their 30th Anniversary. Let me start off the the positives. The check-in process was very easy and the lady who checked us in was friendly and accommodating. She gave us a room on the 11th floor at the end of the hallway with a great view. My Husband and I spent awhile decorating the room for the anniversary and put a dozen roses and a ""happy anniversary sign"" and other decorations we bought in the room for the big surprise. My Parents loved the room. They said it was quiet and liked waking up to the awesome view. My MAJOR problem came the next day when we were getting ready to check out. We met up with my Parents for brunch before checking out. They packed their stuff up and left it in the room as we requested, and were granted, late checkout. After brunch we all went up to their room to get their stuff and arrived to a clean room and ALL the decorations we had given them were gone including the dozen red roses, which were just purchased the day before. Housekeeping had come before they checked out and completely took everything out of the room and left only their bags. My mom wanted to keep the flowers (which were brand new) and all the decorations we had given them. These items were stolen out of the room and probably just thrown away. All that was left was an empty vase - why would someone do that??? I considered this stolen property. When we went to the lobby to check out I informed the lady about the items, which were taken out of the room by housekeeping. I expressed my dissatisfaction and she contacted housekeeping, who did not return her call. Meanwhile, my family (six people) sat waiting for 20 minutes. Finally a manager came out and told us they could not do anything about these stolen items unless I filled out a report, as this is their ""policy."" Since everyone was waiting and already upset I just left, but seriously that is ALL they could do??? I spent over $500 at this resort between the room, dinner and Orange Sky, gambling, and drinks, and $30 worth of my property (roses and decorations) were just thrown away without cause. Why would housekeeping clean a room when late checkout was requested??? All in all, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this resort. I live in town and have been here multiple times, but will not return again unless someone addresses this issue. Customer service should be a priority, not an after thought!",negative
"I stayed at the resort during a CSIA convention so I will be reviewing both the rooms and the casino and restaurants. As far as the actual rooms go, they were really really nice. Brand new. Big bathroom with walk in shower that has the water fall straight from the ceiling and separate bath tub. The beds were nice too, and they even give you up to 6 complimentary water bottles a day in your mini fridge (just be sure to ask!). If I were just to write a review on the rooms I would give it 4 stars. Now for the casino and restaurants. The casino was clean. I won money! The reason it only got 2 stars (honestly, if not for the nice rooms, my review would be a 1), is because the casino and restaurants have a really cheap feel about it. I know they are trying to make money, but geez! First off, don't go to ""The Sports Bar"" in the center of the casino. The girls that work there are really B**chy. Second, The bar in the center pours the weakest drinks I have EVER ordered (keep in mind, I spend a lot of time in Canada, and they are legally required to only pour 1 oz of alcohol into each drink, so to say this bar pours weaker drinks than Canada is saying something!). The food at all the restaurants is mediocre. The Orange Skyy bar on the 15th floor was actually descent, but you sure do pay for it. For Scottsdale you can find a place to stay for a lot better bang for your buck.",negative
"The atmosphere here was great, the food wasn't bad, but the service was. Our server had a bit of an attitude and he took a very long time to bring us the bill at the end. That was a disappointment. I also got a Coke and it had no flavor or carbonation and I told him this saying there must be something wrong with the machine and he came back and told me nothing was wrong with the machine. Ok, well, something's wrong because Coke is not just brown water lol. I don't really drink myself, but I'd only recommend coming here for drinks. Maybe some appetizers if you were feeling hungry, but probably go somewhere else for dinner. There are a lot of restaurants in Montreal, don't settle for this one.",negative
"Beautiful rooftop location, but overrated. Atmosphere is one of wait staff running by, tripping on chairs, and tight spaces. The Old Montreal Fashion was too sweet and isn't made with the liquor brands advertised on the website (meaning lower quality ingredients). Stop by and take a picture of the view, then leave to order a drink at a real bar.",negative
Dommage que les portions sont insultantes par rapport aux prix ... les frites brul√©s . Anyways le service est bon et la vue agreable mais qualit√© rapport prix decevant ... il y a de la place √† l'amelioration surtout la musique forte et agressante en pleine heure de lunch ...,negative
"I visited this bar for late night drinks with friends after a full day of attending a conference for work. It was the perfect place to unwind. We had a great view of the city and the cocktails were great. We only wished they were open a bit later. They closed at midnight and they started turning off the lights and shutting things down around 11:50. It was a Sunday night, but on a warm summer evening we would have loved to stay longer.",positive
"Out of all the terraces that we have been to in Montreal, this place is hands down the best one! It is located in the Place D'armes Hotel, on the top floor. The view is absolutely breathtaking and drinks -- the strawberry sangria especially -- are so so so delish. I would recommend making a reservation or showing up at not so busy times as the spot is rather small and busy. The ambiance is very eclectic and you get to see Notre Dame while sipping and eating. Try their poutine and cheese board if you have a chance!",positive
"Pros: Great location, friendly service and a great hand-packed burger--the patty was lightly packed and delicate. Cons: Weak cocktail, oil-soaked fries and the bacon on the BLT was practically just thick slaps of pure fat. The BLT was very tasty, but the bacon was so off-putting we couldn't finish it. Aside from enjoying the nice weather, this lunch was a bust and left us hungry but with heavy, oil and fat-filled stomachs.",negative

Beautiful Diner at this place. View on the Basilic and old town pretty good. Waiter was nice and we really enjoyed the beef in the red wine. Food and drinks was really really good ! But honestly too much wasps ... That's why i take off one star.,positive
"Really great rooftop bar! Excellent location. Yummy drinks, though a bit pricey. (To be expected, paying for the location & view.) Two levels. We didn't order any food but the meat and cheese plates going by looked delicious! Staff was very friendly and attentive. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. I would say the best rooftop spot in Montreal - we tried 3 total in the same day.",positive
"CREDIT CARD USERS BEWARE. The bar staff here have a fraudulent scam going on. I used my card to pay for a drink, they stole it and gave me back an identical looking card, same bank, same expiry date, different name. The thief maxed out my card immediately after with cash advances and purchases. Thankfully I only use a credit card with a very low limit in these types of situations but it could have been disastrous if the card had a higher limit. Not to mention, the bar/scene was a little trashy so you're better off going elsewhere. We also went to the rooftop Terrasse at Hotel Nelligan which was much nicer!",negative

"The two stars are for the view, which is absolutely beautiful, and the white sangria & mini burgers. The service was absolutely horrible--it wasn't even that busy and we still waiting over 30 min for our drinks and food. I could tell our server was trying to keep his cool, but he was not professional at all and we had to go upstairs to get our checks sorted out. He messed up my check and over-billed me. They need to be more organized and timely.",negative
"Tried this place tonight, the highlight is definitely the view and that's saying a lot because I would have gave this place a lower rating. The service is horrible, took them over 20 min to ask if we wanted a drink and the place wasn't that packed. We took a white sangria which was very average, overpriced and also tasted watered down.We also bought a couple kroenenbourg which were phenomenal. The price is average, range from 7-12 for beers. I would come back just for the view. Beautiful",negative
"First time I visited, my friend and I had a wonderful experience; drinks were great, food was warm and service was good. However, when I decided to bring my boyfriend, it went sour. We didn't have a server, employees kept using the phrase: ""oh, no one has seen you yet"". It was busy, so that was understandable. Nevertheless we werent served water and the pitcher of sangria was a mixture of wine, orange juice, and simple syrup. Not sure where the Cointreau, Bacardi or whatever alcohols they used were, but it was flat out gross. More than half of the menu was unavailable, so we settled. Yet, it took about 45 minutes for the cheese platter. This arrived with our meal despite asking for it as an entree. The overall experience sucked despite the dope view.",negative
Sangria and a view. Not sure if new at time of visit but would recommend going back. Unique view and great atmosphere.,positive
"Very pleasant atmosphere, unlike the regular hotel bars of this type. Very tasty bites, great wine by-the-glass, and nice cocktail selection. Very friendly staff. Will definitely come back here next time I am in town!",positive
"Great location and views, classy and relaxing (priced at the upper end). We had the cheese&fruit platter and red sangria. Cheese was excellent, but the red sangria was nothing special. We have sangria often and have a decent understanding of what's good. This sangria was very watered down (or at least tasted that way). We asked them to put in more wine, but still tasted like flavored water. Finally we had to return it. To their credit they did so without a fuss and were apologetic, then they made up for it with a couple great mixed drinks. Would recommend, but hold the sangria.",positive
"I was in Canada on business last month and visited twice. Once just for drinks and another time for a drink and light bite to eat. Great drink menu! A whole list of different flavored mojitos to choose from. I tried a watermelon and it was refreshing. Excellent charcuterie board, perfect for sharing. The brussels sprouts are also worth mentioning as they were delicious. A lot of tables have a great view overlooking the area in front of the Norte Dame Basilica. A very comfortable, welcoming environment which is why I made my way here two times!",positive
"This terrace on the roof of the westernmost building of the three that make up Place D'Armes hotel is the ideal place on a summer's night. The view and al fresco location are unmatched. The food is a subset of that available on the main floor at 701, but it is a perfectly adequate set of choices. The salmon I had tonight was enjoyable if not transcendent. Service is sincere and effective, and the overall experience, on a night like this, is wonderful.",negative
"We stumbled upon upon this restaurant after asking 2 locals for the best place for an afternoon lunch. They suggested we take advantage of the beautiful weather and eat at "" La Terrace."" This was the perfect choice! The ambiance alone was amazing. We wanted to have the true Canadian experience so we ordered ""Poutine. It taste way better than it looks. You have to try it at least once .The sangria with white wine was amazing, a nice drink to have on a summer day. The burgers were also good along with the fries. Overall I highly recommend this place when in Old Montreal.",positive
"Definitely a nice rooftop bar. The cocktail list is well done and well executed, some creative cocktails including the green apple cucumber Gin- my favorite. A variety of Mojito's and they will customize. Drinks are not cheap- I would say $12-$15 a pop. But if you're looking for a cool place to hang out for a few cocktails the service is good, the view better, and the cocktails are pretty well-made.",positive
"I call at 20h50 to ask if they take reservations for terrace and if they are open I will be there in 30 min . Answer ""we are open, you are welcome, just come and if there is seats we have drinks and snacks."" I come at 21h25 and I m told sorry the terrace is closed it s cold. I explain my situation ask for a menager and no satisfaction. Bad service and really bad attitude. PS"" not easy to park a car in the area"" Just avoid, they should learn how to train they employees and how to deal with costumers.",negative
"Good drinks. Fantastic ambience. OK staff. I went in with a friend on a weekday, and because we were early, we got a good table. Our server wasn't very enthused about giving recommendations, and kept asking whether we wanted any more drinks, and decided to bring our checks after just two drinks. She was OK, but what I'll take away from the terrace would always be the view not the service.",positive
"My husband and I stumbled on this place while exploring Old Montreal one day when we first moved here. We loved the view, so we decided to come back when our friend visited for some drinks on a Friday night. I called to make a reservation so that we would be sure to get a table, but I was told that I didn't need a reservation just to have drinks--we could just walk up to the terrace and go to the bar. When we arrived, the hostess told us that the upper deck was full, so she sat us at a table on the lower deck. It was still pretty with the lights, but I was a little disappointed because I had been hoping for a view of the Basilica while we sipped our drinks. We decided to make the best of it and enjoy the view we did have. All during our first round, people were leaving the upper deck and the hostess eventually started leading patrons who were just arriving up there to enjoy their drinks. After a while, she did come over to our table to tell us that she had space for us if we wanted to move, which made our night! We moved up to the upper deck and enjoyed the beautiful view of the Notre Dame Basilica while we enjoyed the next round of drinks. Just two small complaints. First of all, there were tons of bugs all over the tables on both decks, but if you want patio seating, that sort of comes with the territory. It seemed like they were attempting to wipe off the tables as frequently as possible. Secondly, it took quite a while for us to get waters and our second round of drinks. This wasn't a big deal to us, though, because we came up to the terrace for the atmosphere, so we just enjoyed our conversation while taking in the view. The drinks are pretty expensive, but that's typical of this part of Montreal. We love the atmosphere here and we'll definitely be going back!",positive
"Another roof top terrace in Old Montreal that features beautiful views towards Notre Dame church and intriguing sangria list. That was the last stop of our terrace tour and we arrived around 11:30pm. There was a good number of people queueing to get in and if the place was not on the list to visit I wouldn't have waited. The line was managed with as less coordination as possible. People were leaving the bar, but for whatever reason nobody from the personnel knew if there are free tables on the top part of the terrace and if they are ready for new clients. The service was not very accomodating, the young ladies looked like they work in an office doing serious tasks, rather then offering drinks with a smile to their customers. Last comment, avoid tables just next to the bathroom. I regret I had time for only one magic ginger sangria, it was my green day, meaning no driving, so I had to catch a bus. The ginger sangria had chunks of ginger and ginger beer, giving a spicy twist to the drink, some coriander to balance out the spiciness, and good amount of alcohol. Absolutely delicious! I think this place would be best at happy hour time when there is a light and you can enjoy in details the architecture of the surrounding buildings. I'm definitely coming back for more of my new sangria love, Gingergrita!",negative
"Very good hotel Generally great service with exception of primadonna receptionist in the Rainspa. Balcony rooms are large and fabulous. If you avoid the spa girl with the attitude, the place is really special.",positive
"Food, service, and view all great and wonderful!!! A rare find to get all three at the same place. Cheeseboard has a healthy portion of 4 wonderful cheeses complete with crispy baguette. Organic salmon was just great not farm raised and not over done or with too much salt. Waitstaff hip and dressed in a nautical theme that was pleasant to the eye but also serious to please.",positive
Droves of flying bugs were on this hotel rooftop which made it very difficult to relax and enjoy the gorgeous view of the Notre Dame Basilica. Could also use more comfortable seating. Service was really attentive and I recommend the clear sangria (elderflower and strawberries word!),negative
"Really nice patio with excellent service on the top of the Place des Armes Hotel. On a mild or warm afternoon, the patio teems with guests. Enter through the main level hotel restaurant. Signs or staff will direct you to the elevator leading to the terrace on the 8th floor. The terrace has good views, depending on where you sit. Also, you might end up in a sunny or shady side of the patio, so renember your sunglasses. There are bar seats, as well as high top and regular tables. The cocktail prices here are in the 12-16$ range. The red wine sangria was particularly good (14$). The only drawback here was the presence of both bees and flies. After battling the yellow jackets at the bar, the staff graciously seated me at a table.",positive
"Awesome city views, especially of the Cathedral. Trendy and sophisticated atmosphere. Great place for a cocktail and light bites on a sunny summer day!",positive
"Although a bit pricey, I've come here for Valentine's Day tea with some girlfriends (yay for Galentine's Day) two years in a row and have had stellar experiences both times. What really prompted me to come back the second time was how accommodating they were for guests with food restrictions. When making our reservations, I let them know that I was a vegetarian and they brought out a separate savory course with 3 different types of sandwiches, on par with the ""regular"" sandwich options. The food is divided into 3 ""courses"": one savory course of mini sandwiches and two sweet courses: the first one with scones and biscuits and the second one with deserts (tarts, macaroons, cheesecake, etc.) As far as the teas go, there is a wide selection and you can't really go wrong with any of the options. Some personal favorites include the Jasmine tea and Mango white tea! Additionally, everything is presented in a very classy manner and the overall Victorian decor is very intimate and classy as well.",positive
"I recently had High Tea here, and it was wonderful. The Harney & Sons cinnamon spice tea is incredible. It's a loose leaf tea, and even though I've tried to make my own at home, it just tastes better here. The tea room area is very charming, and our party of 5 was seated at a large round table, which was perfect for our hours (literally) of conversation over tea and delicious food. My group had several food allergies, including soy and nut allergies and gluten free. The chefs here accommodated everyone because it's all made in-house. Our waiter couldn't have been more kind and helpful. He was very informative (we asked a ton of questions), never rushed us (we talked for hours), always brought out new kettles of hot water, and he even took a picture (actually, several) for us (yes, we are THOSE people).",positive
"I often travel back to Pittsburgh for business, and have stayed in most of the hotels near Oakland and Shadyside; The Inn on Negley is by far my favorite place to stay. Great breakfast, great staff, great wifi, and overall an amazing experience. Also, try out the high tea if you get a chance, definitely worth it.",positive
"We went for Afternoon Tea. I made a short list of three goals to accomplish while stuck in the lower 48 states: Afternoon Tea, attend a city council meeting, and meet my friend's baby. That's how important tea is to me. I've put on my own five course formal teas, supped on the three-tier tower in Iceland, and gathered & dried my own wild herbs for teasanes. So I'm a tough critic. I will allow that. Tea at the Inn on Negley was lovely and would probably wow the pants off anyone else. There were five ladies celebrating an upcoming wedding and they looked happy. They were super dressed up which made me feel dressed down even though I was dressed up, but hey, I get cut some slack because all I was celebrating was the fact that I was on my way to get an MRI. Which I have to say...I was super relaxed thanks to tea. I was worried I'd eat to much, but the Inn's tea is not as over the top, stuff-your-gut, explode your blood sugar as some I've had. The best dish was the little caprese sandwich on the top layer. It had excellent flavor. My other half survives through tea with me because he doesn't like mayo and has a lower sugar tolerance than I do. He did ok with this tea. There were two scones per person. We couldn't remember what the chef said they were but one rocked and one was average. Not sure how that happened, but maybe one was fresher? We liked the little pieces of fresh fruit on the scone plate: sliced kiwi for me and oranges for him. I thoroughly enjoyed my pot of Oolong tea. This will make me sound trite, but half my brain chose it because it sounded like the most expensive tea on the menu (and you can pick anything you want). Our waiter had told us we could change teas if we wanted at any point, but I didn't. My oolong was very good. I had it refilled. In contrast, my husband was disappointed that the first tea he chose came in a tea bag. Gasp! A tea bag at afternoon tea! And it was Stash no less! I remembered the menu said something about using both loose and bagged, but it wasn't marked anywhere which was which. Whoops. We were both bummed by his tea. And I felt guilty because I'd picked it for him because he'd liked black vanilla tea at another formal tea. We strategized while we ate and I suggested he ask the waiter which teas on the menu were loose leaf and which were not but instead he ordered a grapefruit white tea off the seasonal menu. This was also a bagged tea but at least it was Harney & Sons. So, dear readers, if you want loose tea ASK. I purposely took forever eating the tiny food and enjoyed myself, however the BEST part of tea was what came after. The waiter had told us we were welcome to explore the Inn and we took that to its fullest logical conclusion and poked around every nook and cranny in that place that wasn't locked. In addition to being a tea nerd, I am a B&B nerd so this was an excellent opportunity to do RESEARCH. We started with peering at the art in the dining room and reading about the artists. Next was the other eating room where they have happy hour for overnight guests. And then a living room. All of the rooms are tasteful and classic with gorgeous, stately antiques. We really liked the pigeon hole desks. Upstairs we visited a bedroom with two twins; downstairs an ADA accessible room with a big ol' four poster bed. I salivated over the breakfast menu. Downstairs they also have a little gift shop and a powerd room for tea guests. They have miniature L'Occitane of Provence toiletries in the rooms and while I have seen their stores everywhere, I had never before touched their product. They have a big pump of L'Occitane soap in said powder room and it was a game changer for me: it was the first soap I have ever liked (I hate soap). The bathrobes and slippers are so luxurious you'd actually want to steal them and sleep in them for the rest of your life. Besides axing the tea bags, the only thing that would have made me happier about tea is if they had included an Inn post card. They charge 50 cents for them and I was too cheap to buy one for my scrapbook.",positive
"The Inn is wonderful! I've been in every room and they are all wonderful-spacious, luxurious and sparkling clean. We stayed twice in the Empire. It's sooo comfortable. The bed has great linens and the jacuzzi fit both my husband and I, albeit was tight! The downstairs room is huge and great for folks who will have difficulty w the stairs (no elevator-3rd floor's a hike). It is however right next to the check-in area. Room pictures on website are exactly as shown. Breakfast was top notch! Chef Cody & Joshua couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Worth every penny! To add-it's so nice to walk down the street and enjoy great little shops and cafes :)",positive
"Had a lovely Saturday afternoon high tea date with my daughter. When we travel to the U.K. and Ireland, etc we love having afternoon tea. The Inn certainly lived up to our high expectations. Yet another little Pittsburgh gem not to be taken for granted. The tea selection is immense but not overwhelming. The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are simply delicious. Refined, refreshing and elegant without being pretentious. Beautiful Victorian home with rooms decorated to reflect the authenticity of a time gone by. The guest rooms are spacious, very pretty and immaculate. Teddy Bears adorn the rooms and hallways without being overdone. Truly a must-see, must-do experience. Can't wait to go back.",positive
"My best friend and I try to do afternoon tea once a year during the winter months and this was our second time visiting The Inn on Negley. The first time we visited the staff that greeted us at the door wasn't all that friendly. They pretty much judged us from the get go as if we were too young to be having a nice afternoon tea. So after that we decided to give it another try and hope it would be better. Thankfully the staff was much nicer this year! I've never had afternoon tea elsewhere to compare this experience to but I personally love it. They have a really nice selection of teas to choose from. Each table gets an assortment of scones, desserts, and appetizers/tea sandwiches. These selections change every day based on what the chef decides to make that day. Both times I thought the selection was fantastic.",positive
"My girlfriend and I stopped here for high tea as a pre holiday treat. The Inn is completely decorated for Christmas both inside and out. We were even allowed to tour a vacant guest room. It felt so warm and cozy inside. I was very impressed by the way the room and bathroom had been modernized yet had a homey feel to it. The room where we were led also had a ""Dicken's Village display set up. It's not often I see one of those. So our very friendly waiter came over and explained the teas. I learned that the ones on the holiday menu are bagged teas. Their regular menu is all loose leaf. We were told we each could have a pot of our choice which was completely refillable. If we weren't happy with our choice then they would replace it with another one. My first one was a chocolatey mint one which was one of their Christmas blends but I didn't care for it. I settled instead for a loose leaf pomegranate. My girlfriend was happy with hers. The place setting was set up with everything you need for tea and shortly the chef brought out our 3 small courses on a three tiered platter. The top platter had some tea party sandwiches. The second had orange flavored scones. The bottom had desserts once of which was pumpkin pie with pumpkin seeds on it. On the table were jelly and cream for our scones. I didn't think that we would be full after seeing so little but indeed everything we ate was very good and extremely filling! We got our tea pots replenished several times and just basked be inside a cozy environment with it being so cold outside. Street parking is available although it is permit for up to two hours so you can park during the day for that amount of time only for free. This is a perfect place to take someone for a special occasion. They also serve brunch here as well. You must call however, for reservations.",positive
"I went here because my sister had High Tea at Noon on her wedding day. It was such a cool experience! I loved it. I felt like a dainty person. Kind of. It was like we were in a different time in a different world. I love the decor. The food was scrumptious. And of course, the tea was wonderful! I'd love to go back to The Inn on Negley!",positive
"One afternoon I begged my husband to take me out for tea. He was curious as to what was so special about high tea. I briefed him on tea sandwiches and treats and quickly insisted it was a 'girl thing' and suggested I should have a girls day out. I wasn't upset that he didn't want to go and was so happy I got to experience the cuteness with my gal pals. Upon entering this beautiful Victorian home, I was greeted with a warm welcome. That's always nice! They offered to take my coat and insisted we tour the house before tea time. I obliged! The house is stunning to say the least. I wouldn't mind having a staycation there! Once seated, they explained to us that each person gets their own pot of tea with a choice of two teas! The chef came out with a three tiered platter with sandwiches on the top, scones in the middle, and sweet treats at the bottom. All were quite delicious! Based on the pictures on yelp, it looks like the varieties change. Although the tea service is kind of pricey ($25/person), it was worth it. The service was excellent. The food looked like it wouldn't be enough for me but I was surprised I wasn't craving a steak afterwards. It was perfect. The tea was ok. My favorite is the vanilla creme. I also had the green tea and was disappointed. Usually I like green tea but this was a bit bitter than I would have liked. There were other choices that sounded more appealing. But hey, it gives me a reason to go back! My overall impression of the Inn and their tea service was excellent! I'd definitely go back for another girls day out. I think it can also be a great place to have a bridal shower, baby shower, or take your mom out for tea on Mother's Day. Super adorable!",positive
"After I got engaged, my mom asked me what kind of bridal shower I wanted. I told her I want a formal tea party. Most of my family lives in Pittsburgh, so they took it upon themselves to plan the tea party. They chose The Inn on Negley for afternoon tea. It was everything I wanted and more! We had a side room with a round table that sat the 8 of us. It was very private. When the food came out I was amazed! There were little cucumber sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, crostinis, 2 types of scones, cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, and little bundt cakes. There were enough for 1 piece for everyone. The food was so delicious and filling! I usually don't like scones and think they're too dry, but these ones were perfect! Everyone gets 2 different kettles of tea. Each kettle is about 3 glasses. For the first kettle, I had Wedding Tea (naturally) It was delicious! The second tea I had a vanilla cream. This was great too! I think everyone enjoyed all of their tea. My mom got a chocolate mint that she said tasted like Andie's Candies. I thought the building and some of the rooms were so beautiful! My family loved the tea and whole experience. We decided to make it a tradition to come here every few years. I definitely recommend it!",positive
"FIVE STARS!!!! Let me start with the amazing duo of Cindy (coordinator) and Liz (owner) who both made this luncheon/tea an occasion to remember. I wanted a Downton Abbey type of tea party, minus the crazy hats and Yorkshire accents. ;-) But, I live in another state, so I arranged this event by phone, and unfortunately did so at the last minute (not recommended) and these women were so understanding and gracious and pleasant and FUN, my family was BEYOND happy. ::: The ambiance/tea room was outstanding. No detail unconsidered. Including the amazing tea. ::: Now, I can't forget to review the food which was not only exceptional, but perfectly plated. Finger sandwiches, scones, mini patisseries, all brought out to enjoy at your leisure. We loved those scones so much, with the creme fresh and homemade jam, Chef Albert gave each of us scone recipes and talked us through ingredient substitutions if needed. ::: Bottom line is, If you live in Pittsburgh and overlook this gem, you're foolish. Take one afternoon, say no to the over-portioned, homogeneous chain restaurants, like Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory, and go to the Inn to create a real Pittsburgh memory.",positive
"This gorgeous little B&B was our May stop on the ladies brunch tour of the burgh. I made reservations ahead of time so that there was not an issue. Glad I did as they had a large party coming in as we were leaving. Tip: Enter through the back doors. The brunch is (for the most part) all inclusive for sbout $25. )We were offered beverages-coffee, tea, juices. We were then brought a fruit cup and a small plate of muffins/bread. The morning glory bread was full of good for you stuff and resembled a zuchini bread. The banana choc chip mini muffins were so yummy! We were then read the menu of the day which consisted of a french toast topped with berries and granola or an egg dish with veggies. We were also informed that we could request eggs any way we liked them with toast and breakfast meat. I went with the French toast and a side of bacon. The main course took a little longer than expected but, we enjoyed our conversation and sipped on coffee that was never left empty. When the French toast arrived, it was well worth the wait. Cooked perfectly and topped with yummy berries and granola. Yum, yum. After we were finished with our main course we were given a small lemon bar for dessert. The tartness of the lemon was a great way to finish our meal. Overall, it was a delicious experience in a beautiful place! Take mom, she'll love it!",positive
"We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day.",positive
First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING,positive
"If you are looking for a unique place to try for brunch this is the place to go. Nestled in Shadyside on Negley Avenue don't drive by too fast as you could easily miss the small sign out front. The Victorian home is a bed and breakfast and the rooms are beautiful with privates bath. I would love to stay sometime. I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely amazing. While the food is delicious the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch in a old Victorian home is worth the price. For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, pastries, entr√©e, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee or juice. The tea list is extensive and I recommend the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream. On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house. This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample. Next up we got to pick our entr√©e-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option). My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon. The omelet was amazing and had such great flavor. For dessert we were all given extremely cute lady bug sugar cookies. The service was fantastic!",positive
"What a wonderful location! My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room. It was tastefully decorated and beautiful. The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well. The tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious! They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around. The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones. What a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!",positive
"Amazing! I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect! Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. A++++!!!",positive
"This place is adorable and quaint. It's a former house turned into a bed and breakfast plus a restaurant. I had brunch here. The staff was clearly very well trained and put a lot of effort into the details, while retaining it's cozy, intimate, homey feel. The food was also quality.",positive
"The attention to detail at the Inn on Negley is simply impeccable! We had high tea here a couple of days before Christmas, and it was everything we hoped it would be! The overall experience put us in a festive mood and we look forward to going back again in the future! The service was outstanding, the tea delicious, and the Christmas decorations were quite lovely. The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are why I gave the rating of four out of five stars. They were good, but could have been a tad more tasty. I agree with another review on here that the bread on the tea sandwiches was a little stale. We enjoyed the scones, but they could have had a little more flavor to them. And I would have preferred a different dessert choice other than a small heart shaped sugar cookie, which went along with a bite of gingerbread cake and a chocolate truffle. All in all, we went for the experience and the Inn on Negley more than delivered! The innkeepers were there and were very friendly and gracious. We took a tour of the inn, which is one of the original Shadyside mansions, and the rooms were elegant and filled with beautiful antiques. Again, the attention to detail in each room is like no other. I would love to stay there one day! We will definitely be back for tea in the future!",positive
"I was the lucky birthday girl at a surprise High Tea party for eight at The Inn on Negley. The service is as good as it gets. We placed our first tea order (you can change it up however many times you like!) then the chef came out to explain the food she had made. For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich, egg salad sandwich, and cucumber dill crostini things. The second tier had two types of scones and cantaloupe slices. The third tier was mini cupcakes, brownies, and strawberries and cream sandwich type things. Even though the food did not look like a lot it really was filling. The atmosphere was beautiful and comfortable. Not stuffy or too formal at all. We felt comfortable having a good time while being ultra ladylike. The place settings were very pretty and just what I expected. The only reason I did not give The Inn on Negley 5 stars is that some of the food was better than others. The egg salad sandwich was dry, bland and the bread was a bit stale. The chicken salad sandwich, however, was the BEST chicken salad I've ever had. High Tea is definitely worth the experience at The Inn on Negley! I'd love to go back and stay in a room for a little close to home treat some day.",positive
"Absolutely adorable! On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service. Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it! And... You MUST try this place! This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol! And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn! Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point. But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here! Let's get to the tea service though! It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a ""ladies who lunch afternoon"" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom. It's in a parlor, which is small but charming. There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing). There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad. There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home! The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too. I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly. It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point. There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too! The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food. I've never heard of them doing that before. Usually you get one tea choice and that's it. I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge. Very unique and a definite perk of coming here. I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side. The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner. I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal! There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette. The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice. It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those! There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger. Those were actually surprisingly tiny. I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them! Oh, and there was also fresh fruit. Which is great and all, but more scone please! The last tier was the desserts. Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries. Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain. While it was good it wasn't life changing. BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had. Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds. I would buy a batch of those if I could! Seriously, can I?? I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho! But I also love it for myself too! Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper). But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!",positive
"I met a friend for high tea on a weekday so we were the only ones there which we didn't mind at all given that we both brought our two year old children. We were served by Chef Jackie who I found to be friendly and informative. I was very impressed with the large selection of tea that included both loose and bagged options. We were told we could try as many as we wanted. I must admit I was a little disappointed with the quantity of sandwiches given. We were served an egg salad sandwich, a ham with avocado, and a take on a BLT which was bacon, tomato, and julienned spinach on top served on a piece of French bread. I wanted more. The second plate had fresh fruit and two scones- citrus and vanilla cream. Both were delicious but small in size. The final plate had a brownie, sponge cake, and small cupcake. Everything was delicious but I would have rather have had another sandwich or two over the last plate and larger scones. All of this cost $21pp.",positive
"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday. Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad. We were served three tea sandwiches: egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite. Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite. But it was the best part of the meal!!! (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread). We were offered two types of scones: cranberry and eggnog. Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever! Then, the pastries: we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop! A pumpkin torte, again, fine. And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone! It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie. Yuck. Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!! Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison. Not impressed at all! Will not go back there, ever!",negative
"Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons! From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities. It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house'?) is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane. Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays? They make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant. There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back).",positive
"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head... ...having wine and cheese... ....or breakfasting. The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed. The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular. We were in the lovely Northern Spy. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious. L'Occitane bath products smelled divine. The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings. Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure. Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room. The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee. Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs. Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery. Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious. Breakfast meats are lean and filling. Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served. Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room. Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious. Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba). If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley. That's probably sufficient gushing.",positive
-Beautiful interior and Deck -Courteous Staff -Delicious leisurely brunch * Greatly appreciated that the chef came outside to greet us and describe their brunch service. -Affordable afternoon tea service,positive
I stayed here last weekend the rooms are spacious the bathroom is really nice but the only complaint here is I was promised a view when I booked to stay at the venezia tower and all I got was the air conditions and looking at the mirage to me that's lying to people and stealing their money and when I called to complaint they said sorry we don't have anything else it's all booked so I'm giving this hotel one star for lying.,negative
"I was struggling on the rating of this casino because everyone in the group won some money, but the customer service we received from the servers was pretty bad. You can No longer get drunk while gambling since the server come and check up on you every 30 minutes and they only bring you 1 drink at a time. We wanted to continue gambling but wanted to drink as well so we opted out to go to a bar instead. Every time you ordered a drink the server asked, are you playing and are you going to continue to play. Even when we tipped they were still rude. And every server feels so entitled to tips, even with their shitty attitude!",negative
i was here at venitian 2 yrs ago. i have played poker in their room. and i really believed that they had the best poker room in town. but because i was running bad and lost all my life savings and became homeless. i said alot of wrong thing about venitian's poker room. i returned on hopes that i could make ammends. but i see that they are unforgiving. its ok. im just a small fish in a ocean. believe wen i say i really love all u guys. but i will never play there again. because they dont have the heart to forgive. they forgot all that i tipped and raved about how good venitian is. i appoligize but to be true and good. u have to forgive. be in my shoes and be homeless. and talk to me after.,positive
"Excellent stay!! Thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, would definitely stay again. Very clean, beautiful details throughout. Beds are extremely comfy, we asked for hypoallergenic sheets and pillow cases, they had them switched out within an hour. Ate at Buddy V's in hotel, great Italian",positive
"A great time for me, my wife, my son, and in-laws. From the beginning the staff were very polite and formal. Checking in was a little long but since we had 2 rooms and the check-in lady needed to figure out where to put us and what names to attach to the rooms I didn't mind. She even got us attached rooms which was convenient for my son to be babysat lol. The decorations were beautiful, the art on the ceiling was worth a few pictures, the casino was nice, and our rooms were awesome suites. I don't want to go too much into detail or I'll be writing all day. The inside of the hotel was like a movie set, or theme park. They had a nice indoor and outdoor canal for boat rides while the rower sang for guests. The stores and food counters were plentiful and classy. From clothing, to sun glasses, cigars, this place had it all. The ceiling and lighting made it look like dusk in Venice. What else can I say? The hotel was beautiful, our trip was fun, and I'll definitely be looking at room prices for this hotel again.",positive
"Stayed there for 6 nights. Great interior, nice pool area and decent gym downstairs. The only negative thing is that we got the bath refills every other day or even less, sometimes it was a lack of soup which is weird for this kind of not cheap hotel. Cleaning was OK.",positive
"The Venetian is always a classy nice hotel to stay at. Very clean modern and I've had good night stays here for many years since 1999 and I've always been a returning customer! First time I stayed at the Venetian was grand opening weekend I believe it was in 1999, not sure. This place is always home away from home 16 years and still stands out!! Check out Tao night club From 2006-2009 Tao was one of the best night clubs in Vegas! Must eat the the grand lux -always good food And lavo is great spot as well.",positive
"The hotels customer service was the WORST I've ever experienced in my entire life. I stayed there for my birthday weekend a week ago either four friends and was told we could only have two towels per room. After much haggle, I was finally able to receive 4 towels (one per person) and received numerous calls at 5:30am about blankets. Really ?! The following day I called the front desk and it took an HOUR to receive extra shampoo and conditioner for us, and we ended up being late to a dinner we arranged for my birthday. I complained to a manager about the middle of the night calls on a Friday night, and the extreme delay and struggle of obtaining shampoo and I was told it would not happen again. The following night we received the same issue with receiving extra blankets. I called and spoke with a manager named Erica the following day and she was unable to track down the person calling and saw how upset I clearly was and refunded me the resort fees for the inconvenience. When we checked out I was informed that they had made a mistake on their part on charging (even though I booked the hotel through booking.com) and that they would deduct it from the refund I was suppose to receive for all of my inconvenience. Nice, right ? I called today to respond an email about my refund and was put on hold for FORTY MINUTES only to be hung up on. Even after my stay at this wretched place they're still giving atrocious customer service ! I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest staying elsewhere such as the Bellagio and only going to the Venetian to shop and dine. If you do decide to stay at this hotel it's guaranteed your stay will be ruined by their staff !!",negative
"OK, so check this out. I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them. Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move. Got it? OK, let's proceed... Review #39: 6 stars!; this place is the best, and probably my favorite casino/hotel in Las Vegas; you have your choice of the lively 1st floor, or the more serene 2nd floor which is mainly the Grand Canal Shoppes situated along canals complete with gondolas for hire; it is always daytime here, with a blue sky & puffy white clouds painted on the ceiling overhead; particularly love the St. Mark's Square area, especially getting an ""outdoor"" table or sitting at the bar at Otto Enoteca; there are a crazy 5 floors of conference rooms here; the somewhat hidden Venezia Tower houses the classy Bouchon restaurant and beautiful pool-side gardens outside; adjacent to Palazzo, so hard to tell where one ends and the other begins; best craft beer bet = the fantastic choices include Sin City Brewing, Public House, and maybe best of all, Yardbird; the Venetian has the best overall craft brew selection on The Strip!",positive
"Everything in this hotel is plush, velvet, gold, granite...the epitome of class, expense, and luxury, but borderline gaudy. I did have some difficulty finding the pools, and really wish I could've had a humidifier for the dry desert air, but the week I spent here was by far the most comfortable stay I've ever experienced at any hotel ever. The staff was on top of everything, I only had to lift a finger to dial the front desk or room service.",positive
"While The Venetian in Las Vegas is nowhere near as grand as the real thing in Italy, it does offer a taste of Europe, but minus the pick pockets. I've stayed here a couple times and since it's an all-suite hotel, all rooms are spacious, complete with a separate couch space for watching TV, or staring blankly at a wall while fantasizing about winning the Megabucks jackpot. It may not be as modern as the City Center hotels, but you'll be more than satisfied with the amenities and shops.",positive
"Although the Venetian is no longer the hottest or swankiest hotel on the Strip, there's still lots to like about the experience, especially if you're staying here. In particular, the rooms are extremely spacious, and although decorated in a somewhat kitschy way, they're still spotless and cozy, and feature lots of thoughtful amenities. In fact, you could spend so much time relaxing in your room that you could forget all that Vegas has to offer, right outside. Having been eclipsed by the Wynn and Bellagio and, nowadays, the Cosmopolitan in terms of sheer buzz, it's increasingly likely that you can find great deals here on traditional booking sites like Orbitz or discount sites like Priceline. And if you do find a deal here, it's well worth the splurge.",positive
For the second time this place made unauthorized charges on my credit card after i checked out. this also happened last year when they accused me of taking a bottle of water from the mini bar and i was billed $40. Other Las Vegas hotels don't do this!,negative
"VERY DISAPPOINTED - Poor Customer Service!!!!! My husband booked a wonderful birthday weekend getaway in a Bella Suite at The Palazzo Hotel but when we arrived all they had left to give us was a handicap accessible room or a smoking room. We had no choice but to take the accessible room as we are not smokers & can't take the cigarette smoke. They promised us a room change the next day which took 5 - 6 hours and they didn't honor their promise to call us when the new room was ready. On the last night my husband requested a late check out @ either 12 or 1:00 and @ first they said ok but then phoned us right back & said sorry but they had a VIP coming in the next day & they needed that exact room (non-strip view) & we must be out by 11:00 am. They didn't honor the birthday invitation offers at all either that came w/ our reservation deal. Having to use a handicap room while battling my Lyme Disease, unpack & repack to move the next day. Really poor customer service overall yet we are Club Grazie members. Will seriously re-think about booking with Palazzo or Venetian and most likely find another more honorable customer service oriented establishment.",negative
One of my favorite Hotels in Vegas. The rooms are awesome. Always clean and the decor is really nice. I love the Italian theme. The casino is on the high end. Has a ton of shopping and eating spots here. Tao is an awesome club. I love the music they play here. Great place to stay.,positive
"The king suite has large old couch that is fading in color. They could afford the other furniture to replace but kept an old couch. See pic. Also, bathroom light is low where anyone can walk in and see you using it. Thank god, I have no guests. Venetian should be a 3 star hotel. Dropped to one star for our stay there.",negative
"The hotel was beautiful and it was so clean! The casino floor was nice, the staff were friendly, and my room was huge! The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in in my life! Totally worth every penny.",positive
"Every once in a while, I get a craving for the Venetian. I've stayed here with my family a couple of times and can never forget the wonder I experienced as a young teen walking into the beautiful marble lobby with the Michelangelo-type painted ceiling that I could get lost staring at. Also, the golden globe shaped fountain, and the blue sky painted ceilings one witnesses while walking through the hotel always amaze me. One of the pluses of Las Vegas is the fact that every hotel seems to have created an ""experience"". Having been to Venice, the Venetian does a great job in recreating that experience - just newer, more compact, and with lots of gambling, lights, and entertainment. I am always impressed by the sheer size of the suites (every room is a suite!) and the grandeur of each room. Though the Palazzo may be ""newer and cleaner"", I'm pretty sure that it is missing some facets of that original Venetian grandeur. There is less marble in the Palazzo bathrooms, that's for sure ;) Watching the magical Phantom of the Opera in this hotel only added to its mystique. Till this date, I have not experienced a more enthralling musical - and trust me, Vegas does it better! Another plus of the hotel is the poolside courtyard. It is just far too relaxing and has a way of ridding pretentiousness of Vegas and just taking you to all the way to Italy.",positive
"this will probably be almost identical to my palazzo review. pretty much nice rooms, theres a casino, theres food access. now youre set for sin city. i can guarantee if you win money at the tables you'll enjoy your stay much more. i guess you can enjoy anything much more as long as theres more money in your pocket",positive
"Stayed here from a Monday to a Wednesday in the beginning of August. The room (a Rialto suite) was awesome, even with 5 guys in it. More room than we really needed, but considering we were a group of five guys, we did a lot of pre-party drinking in the room, so it was worth doing it right. The casino was gorgeous, though a bit expensive for us. Which leads me to why 4 stars not 5. If you are planning on doing the cheap drinking at O'Shea's, Casino Royale, Bill's Gambling Hall, OR plan on seeing the younger crowds at the Cosmopolitan, it is a loooooong walk. Even longer in 105 degree heat. So it's a 5 star rating in a 4 star location on the strip. Still, if I was staying here in the future, I wouldn't complain at all. Also, the poolside mojitos, even at $10, hit the spot pretty well.",positive
"One of my favorite places to stay but it is costly. Large luxury suites, Canal Shoppes, beautiful decor and a very large Sports Bar. The Suites are equipped with flat screen TVs in the bedroom, living room and the bathroom too. Be careful not to move the items in the mini bar as you might be charged for it. Two clubs to choose from Tao and Lavo. Both clubs are awesome. A little tip: I was told by the reservations specialist to eat at Tao and you can get into the club for free. The front desk, casino and restaurant staff are awesome. Always attentive and kind. I will always return to the Venetian and Palazzo.",positive
"Spent the Christmas holiday week at this hotel and here is the mess I experienced in the 3 days I was there: 1) Room had two burned out light bulbs. 2) The electric window curtain would open by it self randomly - so be ready to wait up at 5AM! 3) I left the PRIVACY PLEASE on the door only to find the staff trying to enter. 4) When I was out people entered the room with the Privacy Please on the door. (I know because the lights were on.) 5) Outlets didn't work, had to reset the breaker. 6) They don't tell you have a $19 day room fee in addition to the reservation amount. They told me it included internet upon CHECKOUT and that it comes with a paper that is no where to be found. 7) The hotel is full of smoke and the non-smoking room stinks. (Maybe that's just vegas.) 8) The doors to the rooms SLAM loudly! Prepare to be woken up ALL night as neighbors come home. I hope someone reads this and decides to book somewhere else. I often travel for work, so I have high expectations for a hotel. This hotel didn't meet even my basic need as a comfortable quiet place to sleep. I think it's designed to get you out of the room. So if you are a light sleeper you will HATE this hotel.",negative
"This review is for the Venezia tower...My best friend, sister, and sister's bestfriend (all named Jessica!) came with me to celebrate my 25th birthday in Las Vegas. We stayed in the Venezia tower in a Bella Suite (2 queens). Since the Venezia tower is a few years older than the Palazzo or Venetian towers, it's decor was a bit less modern, but still nicely appointed. Other yelpers complained about the long walk to this tower and it can be a mission when you're drunk, but on the other hand, got to burn off those calories someway! It's about a 6-8 minute walk from the lobby, but when you're in heels, it feels a lot longer. By the end of the weekend, we were kicking them off as soon as we got to the Venezia lobby. Anyway, I thought the Venezia was worth the lower price tag - it was the same price as one king bed in one of the newer suites. So, if you have a big group and are on a budget, this place is a good deal for the money! Oh yes, and eat at the Grand Lux Cafe - it's basically the same thing as the Cheesecake Factory! I ate there THREE times during my stay :) +1 Inside the Venetian, which has a billion ammenities +1 Central location on the strip +1 More for your $$$ (2 queen beds vs 1 king) +1 Usually get resort coupons if you book via discount website -1 A decent walk (6-8 minutes) from the front lobby of the hotel",positive
"The hotel is of grand scale and the rooms are clean and accomodating. The down side of our stay was with the security of our stay. This is very important considering 4 ladies were staying there at the time. At approximately 2am our room was rummaged through and robbed. We reported the incident to the front desk, who then transferred us to the security department. In waiting for someone to come and take an incident report, a strange man entered the room again. This stranger saw me and left. In a panic we watched him stroll down the hall, and take up a conversation with acquaintances. Security took over 20 minutes to come to our room, discouraged us from making a report, was rude and demeaning, and not prepared with the specifics to file a report. Management would not speak to us personally, and disregarded our claim, saying that it ""was out of their hands"" since it was passed to security. after the return of our visit, we took the following actions- (1) I called the Director of Security yesterday, and left a message. 7:45 am (2) I decided to wait it out for the 1st business day of the week, and follow up today 8:00 am... We were told to follow up with Risk management. (3) I was then passed me onto, Bill Parker- Director of Claims. I spoke with a woman named, Amanda 8:10 am who then told me that this was not handled in their department, and asked me to call Guest Relations. (4) I then spoke with the coordinator of Guest Relations, Janet 8:12 am. She is now telling me that her department usually deals with ""guest satisfaction"", but graciously agreed to be my point of contact at the current moment. So in conclusion, I was supposed to hear back from this woman by that Thursday, to give her a chance to gather the information, in which I never did. She did inform me however, that normally her department deals with ""situation of quality of room, etc."" We did not hear back from the hotel, or ever receive copies of the reports filed. We did not receive a follow up, no comps, not even an apology! Talk about the run around!!! It may not have relevance anymore, but it affected our safety, sanity, and most of all finances!!! This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I will never stay here again, or any affiliated hotel of this company's again, and advise the same of my loved ones. SAFETY IS PRICELESS!!!",negative
"This is the go to place for vegas/clubbing enthusiast. The rooms are suites and so there is plenty of room to fit 8 ppl on beds/sofa pull outs/couches comfortably. You can pack a couple of more on the floor. Nice and spacious! Its located near everything you need. It connects to Palazzo which has a fun casino with lots of young and old gamblers. The air is more ventilated so you don't have to worry about the cigarette smell. You can cross the streets to go to Treasure Island, Encore/Wynn and even the Fashion Mall. Its walkable! Secondly clubs/lounges are nearby: Tao @ venetian Lavo Lounge @ Palazzo Tryst and XS at Wynn/encore hotel It's a great location overall! Room prices can range but if you have more ppl it can still be on somewhat of a budget, and since club/bars are nearby/walkable you can save on cabs. My boyfriend also likes going to Grand Lux for their Pasta Carbonara as a late night, after drinking snack. Beware, long wait time even after you get seated.",positive
"my favorite place to stay during my visits at Vegas... sometimes it gets pricy but sometimes they do send out good promotional deals! nice spacious room (if you want, you can actually fit 6+ people in one room! nicely!), lots good restaurants within walking distance (i mean inside the hotel) and a good place to shop! oh yeah, their pools are really nice too. i miss it... time for me to go back...",positive
"Beautiful hotel. Gorgeous pool. Nice room. Very good service. I could have done without the stripper perfume pumped in every air vent in the place, but hey, it's Vegas. Can't comment on the gambling as I don't gamble. Everyone looked like they were happily losing their money though.",positive
"Another nice ass hotel. I would actually book a room for myself at this place if I had the money in contrast to the W Hotel. But of course, at the time of my stay, I wasn't financially there and wouldn't book a room to save my life. Luckily, yet again, the Venetian was free for my broke-then-maybe-now-ass. Muhahahaha. Well, it wasn't that great as it sounds now ... ""free."" We were told that a friend who had suddenly gained a lot of money, wanted to treat his friends to a few rooms at the Venetian. Little did we know of how many people he invited ... So we're on our way .. driving at the crack of dawn to Vegas - restless and hungry for food and thirsty for alcohol. We finally arrive at the much anticipated Venetian ... awed by the splendor of decor and richness of bling bling. A bunch of us - girls - open the door to ""our"" room in excitement only to find a bunch of strangers, smoke, alcohol, and sadness inside. So happens, this generous ""friend"" invited everybody and their moms. We obviously had NO WHERE to stay, much less a place to SLEEP on. At 6am in the morning, pissed off and frustrated, several of us decided to check out their ""famous"" pool ... all we found was a jacuzzi and a sorry water area. No pool? Correct. We were so tired and sad that we had no where to stay, that we slept our sorry asses outside on the pool chairs in the jacuzzi area. We woke up an hour or so later to a old white couple staring at us from the jacuzzi. Oh, the thoughts I'd imagine they had ... Long story short, there were several other people who had rooms and we ended up crashing with them, 3 girls to a bed, and still free of charge. The room was the Venetian Bella Suite, two full beds and lounge area with a couch that unfolds to a bed (my bed to be exact =/ ). chairs, a table, TV ... the works. Despite the uncomfort of sharing a couch-bed with two other girls, it was still a nice hotel ... a nice room ... and a nice bed. Words of advice: don't expect satisfaction out of 'free' things. I'd rather pay for a room then to have to stay with strangers. Yet again, I did not sleep on a 'real' bed.",positive
"We ended up spending our entire trip here...even though we didn't stay here. I don't know what the hell the rest of Vegas is up to but the Venetian got it right...I hope this is the new face of Vegas. The Venetian shops, restaurants, and casino were all top notch but affordable, and the staff (except one, see my review on the Canaletto) was great. Next time we stay here.",positive
"One of the finest hotels ever. We stayed in the Venezia tower (some added ammenities) and reveled in our 750 square foot room (larger than out SF apartment!). Rooms are well appointed with luxurious beds/bedding, lovely (and expensive)furnishings, and a bathroom to die for. Marbe soaking tub and seperate glass enclosed shower with multiple shower heads. Service is great..only complaint is registration. Despite the ""private"" check in advertised in the Venzia tower, we waited almost 30 min for one of only two employees to help us (this was the thur before Memorial weekend- more than 2 employees please, folks). Not the wealthies of patrons, we figured out a way to go for less than premium cost. Each suite offer two large queen beds and a double size couch pull out. ""double"" occupany runs about $250/night. Five people fit EXTREMELY comfortably into these rooms. We pulled off the Venetian for about $150/per person TOTAL for all 3 nights!!!!",positive
"I'be loved Westin not just bc of their most comfortable bed, but they're awesome consistency of great customer service. The rooms smells good and super clean, so kudos for the housekeeper. The amenities are superb. I asked if they have a microwave where I could heat up my food bc I just wasn't in the mood to go out right away bc I was just too tired since I woke at 3am that morning and needed a quick nap. They've came to my room and brought me a microwave. The hotel is centrally located to all of what you love. Food and shopping! China town is just right around the corner and Starbucks is right downstairs. Hotel has tunnels that connect to other buildings all the way to shopping and restaurants so you don't need to walk in the cold if it winter time or hot on summer time. Definitely staying back here again and highly recommended.",positive
"For the third straight year, our Company had our Christmas party at this hotel. The first 2 were good. The food and staff were helpful but the last one last December 2017 was a joke. We cut back on our celebrations this last December and just had an ""appies and cocktails"" night. As typical in any company party there were a lot of drinks especially shots going around. It was going well at the start but as 8 pm approached, they changed bartenders. One was an elderly Asian male and the other was a black male. Both looked liked they never wanted to be there (because there were no tip glasses?). No greetings or any positive customer service acknowledgements from these two at all. They started cutting people off from drinking even though it was apparent that people were not drunk. They refused to serve doubles and very all around rude to everybody. When asked, they both smugly answered that ""it was their right"" to refuse to serve people. Even their manager could not do anything about their behavior. Our Company offers us taxi vouchers and even gets us discounts in this hotel, if we wanted to stay overnight. This discourages people from driving under the influence. We have not had a single negative incident during our 3 years here but were being treated like adolescents. Westin should seriously review this. Anyway, we will be voting NOT to hold any events in this hotel ever. We will be bringing our business elsewhere. We will be practicing our right NOT to be treated rudely.",negative
"I have stayed at the Starwood and Fairmont at Calgary and this one is certainly the newer hotel of the lot. It's at a nice convenient location (the others are too). Service is fast and the staff is friendly. The Keg Restaurant is next to the hotel and is a nice place to dine in. There's a StarBucks down too and there are a set of taxis waiting downstairs (even if you prefer Uber it is faster). Overall, a good place to stay.",positive
"Good Location! Near Prince's Island Park and Eau Claire Market (just a couple blocks away)... and then a few more blocks (maybe like 4-5) in the other direction is the popular shopping avenue (aka 8th Avenue / Stephen Avenue) which is then not far from the Calgary Tower. All very walkable. Good Room! Good space so that we didn't seem like we were on top of each other. Nice bathroom size that we could both have our own little space. Beds were comfy, and the air temp was easy to control. There was a mini fridge in our room too. Good Service! Folks at the desk were nice and professional... they weren't gooey sweet, but they weren't stiff either. They seemed relaxed and confident... a good combination to answer questions and deal with people efficiently all day long. Taxis were queued up, and at our service as soon as we asked the valet/bell folks. Good Food! Breakfast was included as part of our stay. The buffet was very good! They had a cold section that included fruits, breads, cereals, yogurt and hard boiled eggs. All were fresh. And then they had a hot area including made-to-order eggs. Everything was prepared nicely and wasn't stale or dried out. The chef even came out to say ""hi"" and speak with everyone for a brief time to get their feedback, and be on hand should there be any questions or concerns. The main restaurant, The Keg - serves food at the bar so this was easy and nice as we didn't really want to do a ""whole dinner"" thing. We just wanted a drink and a couple appetizers... Perfect at the bar! Bartender was very nice and had good timing on helping everyone....He never stopped moving, but he never showed a moment of rush or stress. Net, Net: I'd stay here again should we find ourselves back in Calgary.",positive
Had a reasonable experience as a pre Calgary stampede show. Did 3 nights. Not 5 stars for a few small things but would stay again,positive
"Unbelievable friendliness and service at this hotel. Amazing people from valet to housekeeping. But one person made our trip unforgettably relaxing. Max at the front desk is the kind of person I would hire to be the face of my business. We had come to Canada for my wife's 30th birthday and travelled all over Alberta for 5 days with our young baby. As anyone knows, traveling with a baby is an experience. Our two nights at the Westin was the bookend to an amazing trip. The valet was more than helpful with our mountains of luggage. Housekeeping has already prepped our room with a crib and we were set to go We came well before the normal check in time but max made sure that he did everything he could to expedite getting our room ready. He kept us in informed and let us know places to go in the meantime. He watched over us to make sure our baby wasn't getting impatient by bringing him some crayons and a coloring book. Everyday in the morning he was there to greet us and for such a huge hotel that was hosting several conventions, max made us feel like home and that the hotel wanted us to know we were not just a room number.",positive
"The staff is amazing. Beds are incredible. But for how much you pay, it sucks that you also have to pay for wifi and movies on the tv are $15.00-$18.00. It's expensive",negative
Good staff. Located in downtown and close to everything. A bit old but highly recommend it if you are planning to stay downtown.,positive
"When I found out we were staying in a Westin for our trip to Calgary, I was pretty excited. We came for the Mac's Hockey Tournament on Christmas Day and left on New Year's Eve, and our weather was probably an average of 16¬∞ for the week. The hotel was nice and clean, the beds were nice and comfy, the wifi was strong, and the rooms were normal. If you hang a placard on your door that says you don't want your room cleaned, you get a $5 voucher for food/points every day so that's pretty neat. The Cold So we're from California, I realize that when it comes to chilly weather, we're more sensitive than others. But waking up freezing every morning in our hotel room was not fun. Getting out of bed was so uncomfortable. Early on in our stay, I asked the front desk if there was maybe a trick to the heater (we had it at 32¬∞C and were still cold) or if maybe our heater was broken. The front desk suggested a humidifier (which we already had brought up to the room) and then said it helps to keep the curtains closed to trap the heat. She also said she'd send someone up the next day to check on it and see if it may have been broken. Now I have no idea whether or not that ever happened since no one ever talked to us about it again, but I couldn't believe that in order to get warm in a nice hotel, we'd have to live in darkness and close off our view of the city. Nevertheless we tried closing the curtains all day and night, which (surprise!) didn't work. We wanted that ""Ah"" feeling when we came in from the cold, but it wasn't like that at all; it was just less cold than outside. ""Maybe hotels in Canada are just all cold and we're babies"", I thought. But we happened to walk into the Sheraton down the street, where the lobby was warm, cozy, and actually decorated for Christmas. For a higher end hotel, I expected the Westin to at least have warm rooms when it's cold as butt outside. The Room They were pretty nice, normal rooms. Comfy bed, desk, TV, dressers. The beds don't have a fitted sheet, so you have to re-cover the mattress when you wake up if you move in your sleep. Since the cold was an issue, we ended up taking showers to warm up. A bath would've been nicer, but wouldn't you know it, the rooms don't have bathtubs. Oh, and only one outlet in the room worked, and it was being used by the humidifier and light. Good thing we brought our own external battery chargers! The Staff Every single one of the staff who didn't work at the front desk was amazing. I've never met friendlier maids at a hotel and every staff member who brought anything up to our room was nice, funny, and so helpful. We used our vouchers at the end of our stay to order room service and I called the front desk beforehand just to make sure that the vouchers would cover not only the food, but all the taxes and fees involved. She told me it would be covered and we were good, so we went ahead and ordered. We got our food, Enzo brought it up and was super nice, and we're starting to eat when I get a call from room service saying that the voucher doesn't cover the fees and taxes and the money would just be added to our bill. I tried to tell her that the front desk lady had told me I'd be ok, but she didn't seem to care and was short with me. It was frustrating because it just seemed like the front desk never had it together throughout our stay and everyone seemed to tell us different things. This review almost went down to 2 stars, but Enzo came back up and apologized profusely for the mix up, even though it wasn't his fault at all! He even brought up a bowl of ice cream. That spoke volumes to us. The only time the front desk was at all helpful was when my dad went down to talk to them, and ONLY when they found out he was an SPG Member did they attempt to remedy any problems. If you pay extra to be a member, the staff will do their jobs well but if you aren't elite enough, you're out of luck at this hotel. The Pool/ Lack of Jacuzzi So there's a heated pool and small gym area on the top of the hotel with a cool view of the city. We couldn't figure out how else to get warm and relax, so we headed up to the pool. Now we were with a hockey team of 18 year old boys and knew the hotel was full of hundreds of teenagers so we obviously couldn't expect to be alone. Every time we went up, the pool was full of not teenage boys, but a bunch of little kids splashing and screaming. We know this is out of the hotel's control, but it would've been SO nice to have a jacuzzi to go relax in. We know there's a sauna, but my husband and I didn't want to sit and sweat in separate rooms. You would think a high end hotel in Canada would have a jacuzzi! But not even a bathtub. I feel like my expectations weren't crazy. I just expected a warm building to walk into and sleep in while it's freezing outside. If you're booking high-end in Calgary, try the Sheraton.",negative
"Overall, nice hotel. Finally found the fitness center on the 20th floor of the business tower. The pool looked nice, but the selection of weights was very limited. Anymore than one or two people in that room would be awkward at best.",positive
Ok. Paid 4 bucks at the bar for a coke to take to the room. Was stopped by security and told my glass did not conform to the rules for tiling drink out of the bar. I told him I could do this at the Ritz and he said they were not the ritz. I agreed and gave him my 4$ coke.,negative
Terrible shower design. Small washroom. The interior besides washroom is alright but for what I usually get at Hilton chain seems far more impressive. This washroom is terrible though. Much worse than Hampton Inn. Or maybe it's a Calgary downtown thing. Would definitely not come back.,negative
"My friend and I stayed at the Westin in downtown Calgary for one night last weekend. We paid $150 (tax included) for a standard room with two queen beds. For being right downtown (literally a block from Eau Claire Market), and for being a last minute booking during Folk Festival weekend this wasn't a bad deal. Checking in the reservation was quick and easy, and the lady at the front desk was really nice. Westin charges for in-room wifi, but if you are a Starwood Preferred Member (their loyalty club, it's free to join) you get free wifi in your room for 4 devices. The hotel room itself was nice. The view wasn't anything amazing, but I don't really care about that (mostly saw construction and a parking lot, but you could kind of see some of Eau Claire Market). The beds were super comfortable, and the decor was light and modern. The bath product line the Westin uses, has a really nice green tea scent and isn't too perfumey. One thing that was weird about the room was the bathroom. There was no door for the bathroom, which I'm not sure if this was an intentional choice or if a door hasn't been installed. Instead, right before the bathroom is the closet with a sliding pocket door that you can close. So if you need to use the washroom you have to walk into the closet, close the door (if was very heavy and hard to move) and then do what you gotta do. The closet door doesn't lock either. For a night this was fine, but I would be curious to know if all the rooms in the Westin have this odd setup, or if it was just our room (1024). Safety and security in the hotel was quite good. It's on a pretty main street (4th) downtown, and felt safe. The room doors have the standard lock and bolt, there's an in room safe. Plus you need a room key to access any of the guest floors in the elevator. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, but it was closed by 5pm so we were not able to use it. They also have a Keg and another restaurant, but there are a lot of other restaurants nearby if you don't want to stay in the hotel. One thing that did cause a little issue for my friend and I was the parking. Parking is available in an underground parkade, and when we went in it said all vehicles need to have a ticket. So we bought a ticket for the weekend and paid at the machine. Our room had express checkout, but I wanted to verify charges on our bill (always a good idea) and was told the hotel charges for parking, we didn't need to pay at the pay stations in the parkade. It was a bit confusing, because there are no signs anywhere in the parkade saying that hotel guests will be charged parking in the room rate, and that they just need to register their vehicle. We were able to get the Westin parking charges removed, since I paid about the same amount at the paystation as I would have if the hotel had charged us.",positive
"My spouse and I always get a hotel on his first night home from the rigs (roommates lol!) . We have done this for a while now and this hotel is excellent. Being Starwood preferred guests we got a free upgraded room and free wifi which was excellent the only knock against it I would say was the lobby. It smelled extremely perfumey and was a little drab, and the 'fridge' in the room isn't an actual bar fridge not cooling anything below 6 degrees. The rooms are a great size though and the beds are great. Really good location downtown calgary as well with a Cora's close for breakfast and many pubs and restaurants close by. All in all a great stay.",positive
"First thing I am doing with the wifi that costs an extra $13 is to write this review. Yup, this hotel's archaic practice of nickel & diming for what is now an essential service for business travellers (has that coffee maker ever been used?) was enough motivation to give it a poor rating. Oh and I had to fix the toilet. No free wifi is worse. Priorities.",negative
"Downtown Calgary, Canada... Everything is a short walk away! Great Location, Awesome Views from my Window, and a TOTALLY enjoyable experience in EVERY WAY! Can't say enough about it. Price was very competitive for the total package!",positive
"Duration of Stay: 2 nights Floor: 16 (SPG floor) Connected to the +15. Consistently Westin. Heavenly bed and clean renovated rooms. They have ear plugs and a cute note booming Calgary business. My favourite things that I have not seen anywhere else, is the shower - where the lever to turn on the shower is on the side wall, so you don't end up getting sprayed with cold water when you turn the shower on! (might be a little confusing reading this, but sure you will understand when you see it!) TIP: They have a great Green program here, where you can get 500 Starwood points (or $5 off food/beverage - but the starpoints are a better deal) for each night that you do not need housekeeping, which is very easy to do for one person (there's more than enough towels!) and I usually don't like anyone in my room anyways, when my clothes are flung everywhere! You just have to be sure to hang the notice on your door, in exchange for a voucher to tuck in with your room key at express check out! They actually still refilled my complimentary bottled water, but left everything else alone.",positive
overpriced and rooms are just not as nice and clean as the Sheraton nearb or other Westins. Shell makes us stay here or the Sheraton and I much prefer the Sheraton,negative
"I was really pleased with my last stay at the Westin. I got a good rate, but I wouldn't call it phenomenal like some other reviewers which makes me think I can do better next time! The $38 valet parking seems a bit outrageous too, but after the drive from Edmonton my better judgement was gone and I just paid it. I chose this hotel because it's right downtown and only 2 blocks from the University of Alberta Calgary Centre, where I had a work event. The great thing about this place is it's part of the Starwood hotel group, so my gold membership got me some extra perks, including an express check-in/check-out line, free wifi, and a room of the Starwood Preferred Guest floor (floor 15). As a high-end hotel, the service was as perfect as expected. Staff is exceptional and really looks after the tiniest details of your stay. LOVELY. I had an awesome king bed in my room with a great view (unfortunately, it was blizzarding the week I was in Calgary this time!). I'm especially a fan of the complimentary Starbucks coffee in room, since the Starbucks in the lobby charges $1-$2 more than any other. My room didn't have a tub, which isn't essential but caught me off-guard so when I mentioned it to the concierge at check-out, they made a note on my file to always get a full-tub bathroom. I know it's random, but maybe you're like me and like to soak after a long workday so I don't think I'm totally out there! Four stars this time, but five next if I can get one of these stellar rates, cheaper parking and a full tub ;)",positive
"i rate this hotel as 4 stars for the following: service and friendliness cleanliness very professional helpful speedy shampoo and conditioner agreed with my hair. starbucks situated in the lobby...and in the rooms hotel shampoos and conditioners usually makes my hair very dry. but this one didnt CONS: the room is small though we were upgraded to deluxe no microwave :( kinda lousy tv programs some unecessary charges on top of the room rate self parking is $19 for the entire stay....heated garage though but wow $19... for a big hotel, not as much christmas decor :( pool and gym is closed for the month for emergency maintenance month of december.",positive
"I enjoyed my stay at the Westin. The rooms were average, beds would be a little small for 2 people but the beds were very comfy. I don't have any other complaints, the Westin was clean, and on par with a lot of other hotels I've stayed in. I liked the body lotion they provided - it smelt really good! So far the staff were really friendly, they even provided us with toothpaste, after we forgot ours..... oops! Our view of downtown Calgary was pretty good, and the Westin has easy access to everything in downtown. THe hotel was really busy as we were there while the stampede was going on. It was an expensive day, but I didn't end up paying, so it was all good.",positive
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel, for a 3-day weekend on business. The rooms are luxurious, the beds comfortable and the washrooms nicely updated. One major positive is the quality of the catering. I was attending a conference, and even the most basic food (sandwiches, snacks) were very tasty and nicely laid out. Additionally, the location of the hotel is perfect - in the heart of downtown, within walking distance to the river, shopping, nice restaurants, etc. The one downside to this hotel is the pitiful wifi. It was expensive (in the range of $13/day) and barely worked in the meeting rooms. Otherwise, this was a very nice hotel!",positive
"I'm writing this review from an events perspective. Last week, I led a team building function for a large Calgary-based company who chose the Westin as their event location. From start to finish, the Westin staff catered to every need. I pulled up to the loading dock and to my surprise, the staff unpacked my car full of gear and delivered it to the appropriate room. This has never happened to me anywhere else. I was offered water, asked many times if I needed anything and watched as the staff worked efficiently, even handling last-minute requests that completely disrupted what they were doing with ease and no attitude. Truly unbelievable, especially because many of the staff are young and it opened my eyes to how much I've lowered my customer service expectations. They proved to communicate well with each other and I was never left waiting for someone. At the end of the night, I was again assisted with my gear and treated with consideration, making the clean-up process as efficient as possible. The service and support received by the Westin staff on this night truly is commendable. I should only be so lucky to have this experience duplicated elsewhere. If an organization can afford to have an event here, I'd highly recommend it, as the Westin makes work a breeze for people like myself. Most folks who attend functions don't know what goes on behind the scenes, but valuable encounters like this will positively impact the energy of the event. I was completely stress-free thanks to these folks.",positive
"From the outside, it's not very impressive. Once you enter, though, it looks like a pretty fancy hotel. Yes, the prices seem exorbitant to those who are not used to paying $270+ per night in a city that isn't generally thought of as a tourist destination in April. But, considering that everyone around here charges about the same, I guess they can charge that much and still be at capacity. The front desk staff has been friendly thus far. I haven't ordered any room service and doubt I will, so I won't be able to comment on that. There were both a nice desk for work and two nightstands in my room along with my two queen sized beds. The linens were super nice. I was offered the ""Green Initiative"" deal where if you don't have room service to come and make your bed every night, they wil give you a $5 gift card to use at any of the food facilities in the hotel (which just so happens to include the Starbucks downstairs). Um, yes please. And yes, that was a reason that bumped them up from a 3 to a 4 star rating.",positive
"- being a starwood points group wh0re, i've stayed in a few hotels in my day - can't go wrong with this place. - rooms are great. heavenly beds are an SPG thing, and gaddamn, they're comfy - rumor has it the bloody caesar was invited in the hotel bar - back in the day, well before it was the westin.",positive
"Very comfortable beds. Freezing lobby, but pleasant front desk staff. Our conference breakfasts were rather lame, but I'm not sure if that was the conference organizer's selection or the available options. The buffet items at lunch were good, and the evening tapas had a nice variety of choices. Quick room service, reasonably good choice and quality for the in room menu. Unreliable Internet, regularly lost connection and asked to pay more than once after signing up for a multiple-day package. They comped the Internet when I let them know, but as a business traveller with tight deadlines this service is critical.",positive
"I had a great experience here. They've got great local/sustainable food options in the bar/restaurant. The rooms are very nice. The breakfast is very good. I like the program that gives me 500 miles instead of having my room cleaned. And, I find the staff to be uncommonly friendly and helpful and intelligent. I had a great stay here that motivated me to seek out other Westin's but unfortunately my experience was not the same. The Westin, Calgary really stands out.",positive
We stayed one night during Stampede week and were pleasantly surprised that the staff was very friendly and efficient even though there was a lot of partying cowboys and girls. Nice comfortable bed. The Keg restaurant was really good too. I highly recommend the Westin.,positive
"Wow - after a really awful week I canceled all of my future stays here and will now split my time between the Sheraton Suites and the Cavalier. My inbound flight misconnected in Seattle, and I missed the last flight of the day to Calgary... Of course this was past the cancellation window, no worries - rules are rules, I'll pay for an empty room in Calgary and stay with friends in Seattle, at least I'll have a place to drop off my bags and have a quick shower before showing up 4 hours late to my client... Little did I know... I showed up at 11am and attempted to checkin - ""Im sorry Mr. Allen, we don't have any rooms ready"" ... Really? You charged me for one last night, maybe I can get a key for that one? ... She mumbles about the cancelation policy... ""Look, I don't need an upgrade or anything, I just want to drop off my bags and shave"" .. ""Again sir, I'm sorry but we don't have any rooms available, I could give you a key for the gym and you could shave in the locker room? I stayed at this hotel weekly for most of 2009, we're talking at least 90 nights, and I'm shaving by the pool. Awesome. The icing on the cake came later in the week though - it was raining and I asked a bellhop for an umbrella - ""no problem""... an hour or two later I needed to run up and grab something from my room; I was stopped at the door: ""Need to take your umbrella sir"" ""Oh that's fine, I'm just running up to get something in my room and I'll be back out in 3 minutes"" ""Sorry but you need to leave the umbrella here"" ""What if another guest comes and takes it?"" ""Well then you're out of luck, umbrellas are first come first serve"" This guy seemed to be confused by the whole 'doormen' concept - at nightclubs doormen are free to be pricks and abuse guests... at hotels doormen are paid to suck up to guests and carry their luggage. Compare that exchange to 3 weeks ago at the St Regis Washington DC - I came in for the night and attempted to give the umbrella back to the doorman, he said with a smile ""please feel free to hang onto it sir, it might rain tomorrow"" I want to like the Westin Calgary, hence not deleting the positive aspects of my previous review, but some of the frontline employees at this property need to find employment outside of the hospitality industry.",negative
This is the worst hotel I have ever been to. They are liars and have inflicted unnecessary charges. They have damaged my car.,negative
My daughters wedding group booked a block of rooms. Toronto Westin is totally incompetent from parking to the sign in desk. They booked people into wrong rooms and charged people for parking when they did NOT park there. Totally inept and poorly trained,negative
"I'm doing a review on the food and not on the hotel just to be clear. I've never stayed here so can't comment on the accommodations. I had my company Christmas party here last night. The hotel itself is nice. Even the hall we had at party at was fine. Nothing fancy just a hall setting. Food wise though I have to say was terrible. I think my company needs to book a different place for our Christmas party next year. We started off with a dried cranberry arugula salad, it was meh. Then the potato chestnut soup which I found very starchy and bland. Then the main was chicken break with potatoes and vegetables. My food was cold. Chicken was so dry. The broccolinis were delicious but you can't go wrong with that. Lol. Ended the meal with a bread pudding dish. Did not like it at all. I hope we don't come back. The food to a Westin standard is so bad. The service was terrible I ask for a cup of hot water and it never came.",negative
"Basically the United Airlines of Hotels Do not book here. They will give away your room and offer nothing in compensation. Arrived after a long red-eye from Vancouver and even though we booked an early check-in, the front desk told us they had given our room away. They offered nothing to ease the inconvenience, told us we'd have to wait another 7 hours to check in, and were rude. Avoid at all costs. Service doesn't come close to the price.",negative
"We stayed in the Junior suite with the island and lake view. Its absolutely beautiful. The hotel is clean, but old. The AC is pretty loud, and I had to turn it off to sleep. Wifi is not free, and parking is expensive even for reward program members.",positive
"Overall, I'm very happy with this hotel! It is a little old, and maintenance isn't exactly where it needs to be, but it's clean and seems well-run. I think my biggest thumbs-down was the first room I checked into had a TV so old that it didn't even have any HDMI inputs, which maybe most people wouldn't notice or care about, but I connect my laptop to the TV for movies and TV shows I've recorded. They did swap rooms to one with a newer TV, which I really appreciated. It makes me wonder what sort of upgrade cycle they're on, and why some rooms are so behind the times. Oh, and I found a weird sock in my room, which shows housekeeping isn't as thorough as they should be (Anthony Melchiorri would have a word or two for them!) But, again, overall, this is a decent hotel. Other than ferryboat horns every now and then, it's pretty quet on the 10th floor, which I really appreciate... I'm very sensitive to weird noises in strange places and can't sleep well when shenanigans are afoot. I would return. It's worth it to note that parking here isn't cheap... $50 per night for valet, or $40 per night to park a block or so away and walk. I went ahead and took the valet, but now I wish I'd skipped the rental car and just used taxis.",positive
"I stayed two nights here with my wife when I attended my CPA, CMA convocation. Going to be drinking lots so might as well book a room. The check-in was extremely fast. The receptionist was super nice and helpful to us when we asked for help. Took roughly 2 minutes. We headed straight to our room. We got the lake view. We didn't really care about the city view since we are from downtown Toronto. The room was nice and clean; for some reason I find it not as dry in other hotel rooms in Toronto. That night we ordered room service. We didn't want to go out and eat because the weather was extremely cold. Took roughly 20 mins. and the food arrived warm. We order, two onion soups, two medium rare steaks, and tiramisu. Tiramisu was fabulous. A great way to end the night. The hotel's gym was spacious and their equipment and machines is by Lifefitness; up to date machines. There's also tv and cable channels. There's also towels for you to wipe your sweats. The day after my convocation, the check out was extremely fast again. I headed straight home. Awesome time and one of the best moments in my life. It doesn't take the cake but it is up there.",positive
"This hotel is up for sale, so - nobody cares. Parking is expensive ($35/night) & Valet is even worse ($45/night). They are not luxury service providers by any means. It is super disorganized. Long messy lines. Bell Man - Sometimes they leave your bags on a trolley unattended when they get busy. Front Desk - the LINES are INSANE! I've seen hour long waits to just check in. Sign up for SPG Membership, u get a different line up which can sometimes be faster. Room - Renovated, slightly updated. The Westin bedsheets are the best. I Cleaning Lady/Service - The cleaning ladies are terrible. They don't follow proper sanitation guidelines. They touch your toilet then place fresh towels in your bathroom, then touch your bedsheets. They rarely empty garbage bins properly, so in some rooms they smell. The rooms are incredibly dusty. Room Service - Terrible. Food is bad. They always mess up the order. OVERPRICED. $35 for a simple breakfast that sucks is ridiculous. Maintenance may randomly knock on your door to inspect. Be aware to put a sign on the door or lock it if you are taking a shower or plan to sleep in, this made for an awkward experience - twice. ""Service Express"" - This is the ONLY way to contact anyone inside the hotel. Front Desk, Valet, Room Service etc,. all together on 1 button to call out & there is nothing ""EXPRESS"" about this. I've waited for up to 15 minutes for someone to answer & get my car called up. I stayed here for at least 30 nights because of business. Overall, nothing good about this expect the bedsheets & location. If you like clean, service, any sort of hotel luxuries, not the place for you.",negative
"I've stayed at the Westin Harbour Castle on multiple occasions. It's a very typical Westin: good shower, comfortable bed, same furniture. It's also quite large with two towers with at least 35 floors in each. The lobby is always busy, which means if you check in on a Monday night, you'll probably be waiting for a bit. As for the rooms, they are on the small side but functional. Nothing will surprise you when you walk in the door. The only reason I'd ding the Westin Harbour Castle a point is that the furniture is a bit dated, the TV comparatively small, and the desk chair wasn't functional (no wheels). Service is also the same as any other Westin: Very good but not flawless. The room is always cleaned but housekeeping tends to miss the little details, like replacing the coffee or taking away dirty glasses. Overall, the Westin is a nice hotel and comfortable for those familiar with the brand. It is geared towards business travelers, and the downtown location is quite convenient (there's the Queens Quay TTC streetcar station across the street). I'd recommend the Westin Harbour Castle, especially one of the rooms overlooking the lake.",positive
"Why 5 stars? Because it was everything you hope for in a hotel. --- --- --- Cheap. Centrally located. Nice. 3 for 3 here gets 5 stars! I assume the underwhelming ratings are because of one of two things: Either the hotel was recently renovated, or I got a rare steal through Hotwire. I am not a big believer in pouring a ton of money into a hotel, since I'm just there to sleep, so I found $125.52 to be quite the deal for this centralized dwelling. I was able to walk to just about anything I needed during my brief stay in the land called Canada.",positive
"This is a very nice hotel, located in the Harbourfront and close to Yonge Street and Downtown Core. It's also a short walk to St. Lawrence Market, Distillery District, Air Canada Center, Hockey Hall of Fame, CN Tower and Rogers Centre. The service was excellent from the front desk to the concierge. The fitness center and indoor pool are also very nice. The room is spacious and I was fortunate to have a view of Lake Ontario and the ferry boats. It's about a 25 minute ride from the airport. The only slight knock to the hotel is the amount of construction going on in the area. It made a few nearby streets difficult to get around and there is some noise associated with it. Overall, great hotel for anyone visiting Toronto for business or pleasure.",positive
"This is the top hotel in Toronto for the Marriott chain (the Ritz-Carlton is in the ultra high end category) and is located right on the waterfront Rooms are top notch with a very modern look. A lot of conferences are held here and there is a modern conference center attached to the property Conferences need lots of rooms, fast and friendly service and standard amenities like Wi-Fi, on - site parking and on - premise dry cleaning Throw in some wonderful bars and restaurants within the hotel and everyone is happy This hotel is also a go to hotel for the upper scale traveler with kids The pool and spa are first rate and concierge can help keep the little ones busy Service is understood and demonstrated at all times Enjoy your stay!",positive
What a most excellent place to stay for my last night in Toronto. Got a fantastic last minute rate so fairly reasonable too. They upgraded me to lake view. Wow!! Walking distance to union station & subway. Also convention center. Front desk person was very kind & helpful. Also he gave me free internet. Extremely comfortable bed too. Next time in Toronto I will stay here the entire visit.,positive
Stayed here for new years eve. Its a nice hotel with busy restaurant in lobby. We stayed on the 3rd floor. The view of the lake was nice maybe ask for higher floor for better views of the city. The hotel is a 4 star hotel so expect that WiFi is not free only free in lobby. The king size room was spacious and nice. The hotel was a perfect stay for group of friends. The service from front desk was very good. The parking was expensive see if you can park in the lot across the street of you don't mind the walk for better value. Overall enjoyed one night stay here would book somewhere else because the amenities were not in abundance and everything had to pay for extra fees.,positive
"My first visit to Toronto. Being a SPG member, I booked this hotel because the SPG agent highly recommended this hotel. Well, needless to say, I will never trust another SPG agent's recommendation and I will never stay/recommend this hotel again. For a massive hotel, I find it odd to see that There was only 1 valet parking attendant, thankfully he didn't make us wait too long but he charged us $45.00 per night for valet parking! $45.00!!!!!!!????? We are now in lobby. There was 3 agents at the desk. Only one of the agent named Evelyn was very friendly and the other 2 agents pretended I was a ghost and they can not see me. Finally after sometime, me and my friends were checked into our 2 rooms by the nice agent... And the night mare begins. We got into our rooms, right away my 6 year old son starts to complain that his feet are itching; I first thought it was nonsense until my body started to itch! I had to take 6 showers during my 2 nights stay. My room was unfinished and dusty. Has patches of paint on the bathroom ceiling. Has walls of dusts on the vents, it's just dirty and old. Now, my friend who also stayed here even had black brown stains on his sheets. After multiple requests include Rude replies by the desk were we then able to get some clean sheets. They charge $35 a night for self parking, $45 a night for valet, $30 a night for a fridge in the room, they even charge for wifi, I was afraid to breath air in the room as they may charge for that too!! Then as we were leaving. An Alarm went off. There was no clear instructions, no elevators and we were not allowed to leave through the emergency stairs either As we were trying to meet our party down in lobby. One of the most unorganized, mismanaged, money hungry hotel I have ever been to. I will never, ever recommend any one to stay here. There are far better hotels with better services and attitudes and amenities out there.",negative
"First, I'd like to say that the Toronto harbour is beautiful. I've been to Stanley Park in Vancouver a many times, but there's something serene with the view here, and when you're walking the waterfront. Also, Toronto girls - you are cute. The location of this hotel is unbeatable. It's right next the harbour, and the views are gorgeous. You're steps from the water front. It's about a solid 15 minute walk to the closest subway (union station), but you have everything you need within that walking distance (bars, restaurants, ACC, Go Train). There's lots of activity here. You can tell this hotel is really customer service oriented. They spend a lot of time with each guest at check-in. A tourist with a lot of questions about the area would really appreciate the attention they give to each guest, but a New Yorker here on a business trip might get annoyed with the pace of the line. I consider myself a clean freak, and can say this hotel is very clean and well maintained. Definitely up to the standard's of other Westin's I've been to. The pool was nice, 9 feet deep which is unexpected for a hotel pool so you can dive. The gym has a really low roof, and it was disappointing for a gym in a hotel this size. There are a lot of kids in this area, so if you're expecting to chill by the pool, get some reading done, and knock back a couple drinks forget it. It's not that type of hotel. You're not allowed food & drink in the pool area, and it'll be too noisy to read. The tennis court needs a new net, and you should paint it blue since the colour you have it in is a giveaway that not much thought was put into the court (USTA and Tennis Canada use blue courts now, most nice non-public places have painted their courts accordingly, it just looks a lot sharper). They need to increase the lobby size. It's a pricey hotel downtown, but the lobby area is tiny. By comparison, the Westin in NYC or even Whistler, once you enter the lobby areas are well designed. This Westin's lobby is tiny, and most of that area is taken up by a bar & lounge. Considering how many people sit in the lobby to connect to wi-fi, it needs to be a bigger area. The conference center area (level 2) is absolutely gigantic, so they could make room for this - maybe have a 2nd lobby or open business center on level 2. I'd stay here again, but for the price I would also consider competitors. It's a good bet, but there are probably other options that are comparable for the price.",positive
"Excellent hotel, valet parking is quick and efficient but pricy. Hotel is across the street from a Tim Hortons so it's convenient. Very close to acc as well! Great for sports fan and athletes! Huge lobby - clean rooms. No problems!",positive
"A long overdue review. When I got my accounting designation, we had our convocation here. Walking into the lobby was so grandiose and I was super overwhelmed as I didn't know where I was going. Once we got there, it was quite a good venue and we even had (our possible future Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau there. While the room was set up perfectly, acoustics were somewhat lacking as we struggled to hear him and was cutting in and out. After partying all night, a few of us shared a room and it had a beautiful view of the lake. Awesome. They have plenty of conference rooms and it seems like it would be a good place to hold conferences too. The hall/room we were in sat over 100 people, so quite impressive. Verdict: Close to Union, big conference rooms, great to hold events and amazing view of the water.",positive
"This is a 4.5 star review. Pro: -Great facility, modern rooms/washrooms, love the duvet and the washroom facility. -Outstanding Service: I almost had the fit when my requested 'connecting' 2 rooms weren't available as I booked with this hotel specific for that reason..however, the front desk were able to find me the joining room eventually. I had to check into one of them first since the other one wasn't cleaned yet ..i was fine with waiting as we could still chill inside the other one. The manager called me later that night to offer us complimentary breakfast for this mishap and was very professional and apologetic about the whole situation. -Breakfast buffet by the way was AMAZING, love their scrambled eggs with cheese and they even had descent congee which I needed after waking up hung over -_- -Complimentary wifi was offered as well although we didn't end up using this. -Good value..price for a night was competitive to a 2-star hotel. Con: -Location is bit far from the city (10 min walk to get to core downtown?) but it's nice in the summer since it's right by the harbourfront. -No descent restaurants or food places nearby. -No working fridge in the room...apparently they have an old one still installed under the tv stand but it doesn't really work like a cold refrigerator anymore. Overall, the value of the hotel was awesome and I would definitely come back to this hotel!",positive
"As a local staying in a hotel, I've got a very different view - but I have to say I enjoyed the stay here, and don't have much to complain about. The staff were friendly, and rooms were clean. The food was meh, but as expected from a hotel. I did like a lot, on the weekend, they had lots of fun activities for kids as part of your stay - ballroom animals (the best I've ever seen), a visit from a live alligator from Reptilia Zoo, movie night with popcorn in the lobby, a cartoonist. I've never seen a hotel go to such lengths for their guests, and it's appreciated. THE ROOM As a Starwood member, we were up at the 35th floor. Only downside is the extremely long elevator rides, especially when it got busy on the weekend. BUT, the elevators are FAST. Love that. The view is great here. At the foot of Toronto, right by the lake. if you can get a lakeview, it's wonderful, but really, how much time are you really spending in the hotel room. Personally, it would be much more worth your while on a middle floor, lake view or not. Room is clean, with a small couch and table. Adequate space. Not sure why hotels these days don't put a convenient plug by the bed, and I had to crawl on all fours to find one. Love the Westin bathroom freebies, they smell nice and these are ones I actually want to take home. The room also has a empty fridge for your personal use (the closest liquor store is east about 5 mins walk) - but the top rack IS NOT refrigerated. Learnt the hard way. They also have a promotion where if you place a notice on your door, and do not change your linens, they will give you 500 Starwood points. Perfect! Except this notice and the do not disturb sign are the exact same looking and kept falling off the handle. There was one FAIL. The coffee machine seems to be equipped for little K-cups, but they give you regular coffee in a filer bag to use which I cannot stuff into the Kcup drawer. Asked downstairs how to resolve this, and they said to break open the bad and put it in the k-cup drawer, i didn't try this, but don't think it will work. No wifi in the room, free in the lobby and restaurants though. If you're a starwood member, you'll get it for free, but need to pretend to pay for it, and they will take it off your bill. A little archaic, and why is wifi something we all still need to pay for! THE FOOD I wasn't impressed by the buffet breakfast. There was nothing here I really could eat (no wheat no dairy)! Everything was bread, pastries, pancakes, french toast. The Scrambled Eggs were mixed with Cheese!!! Sometimes it doesn't even say so, and I had to be careful. On the first morning, I asked the chef at the back if I could have a plate without cheese, and he grumbled at me that I would have to pay extra and to ask my server. But in the end, just plopped some eggs down on a plate for me. The 2nd day was easier. There needs to be more egg options at breakfast. They also had congee to my surprise, which was actually quite good, for western standards. It was watery with no flavour, but add some sesame oil and pickled cabbage and it was quite good. Dinner however was a different story. The first day, it was just okay. I don't eat pork so the only thing I could have was the swordfish - a little tough, but still good. The butternut squash ravioli was excellent except I only had a taste as I don't take to creamy sauces very well. I also then stocked up on the mixed veggies which I saw at every meal. The next day however, lots more choice, and the food was quite tasty. There was beef, and a small mac and cheese which I couldn't help myself. And dessert, a creamy tiramisu thing was delicious. As part of the event, there was a sit down dinner which we were charged $125 for (not sure how the costs break down) but found the food here terrible compared to the restaurant. The steak was bland and not seasoned at al, the chicken breast was dry - the mashed potatoes were good only because they were incredibly buttery. The servers need to learn proper etiquette as he asked me if I was finished with my side plate (while holding the plate to the RIGHT of me) I was confused. THE LOCATION Yes, its by the lake, but this is one of the hotels which was great for conferences and staying inside the hotel for days, but not really so much if you want to explore. It's not really close to anything, except the CN Tower and the Lake (Queens Quay which is overpriced) and our downtown core which isn't anything to write home about really. Really depends what you're doing in town - it's not the easiest area to get around - you'll have to walk 10 mins to the subway, and not much in the surrounding area. If you were staying in Toronto, and want to explore the real heart of the city, stay somewhere a little more central, like on the Hyatt, or if you're a young person, Gladstone or the Drake. Overall, I'm pleased with Westin's offerings and would recommend the hotel, only in the summertime though.",negative
Awful. 30 minutes to check in. Poor Internet service. Very bad selection of channels. Called concierge and twice there was no answer. Never again.,negative
"So disappointing. The lobby space is really nice so my hopes were high. I was checking in late and no one was at the SPG desk-weird. Finally got to my room which clearly is in need of updating: scratches on the walls, cracks in the ceiling, chipped paint, dirty bathroom floor, tiny screen tv. I complained in the morning so they switched me to another room-basically the same run down room with a better view?? To add insult to injury I paid about $350x2 nights on expedia as they jacked up the prices due to a conference, and a friend of mine checked in the second night for a fraction of that. Good location but I will most definitely not be back, feel ripped off.",negative
"Went to the film festival in 2010 and this is the worst Westin I have ever seen. Dirty bathrooms, mold, disgusting. Blah, will never return to this Westin. The Holiday in was cleaner and better appointed. Have stayed at many Westins in the past, this was the worst and most disgusting. I put it right down with the MOTEL 6 outside of Stanford. The floor was so dirty, I did not even want to walk on it barefooted.",negative
"Friends got a special in room deal, paid quite cheap for an amazing double queen beds. Love the set up and decor for the room. It's my prime example on how I would vision a great hotel room too look like. No complains. It's just perfect. The lobby makes you feel like a celeb rolling up. Very busy lobby, lots of check ins. Corporate /business customers but tons of seating while you wait around, nice cafe/bar right when you walk in the front door. Relax, have a drink. You will have a great stay:)",positive
"WARNING-THIS IS A LONG POSTING. That's EXACTLY what I think of this place. Because I'm usually a positive person, lets start with the PROS: *Superb location *Very nice rooms (always love the Heavenly Bed) *Going green (and getting better) CONS: *$30/self parking-A parking lot that is 1 block south of the hotel. Had the parking been attached to the hotel-I would have been fine with the cost. *$14.75/24 hours internet (in-room, but free wi-fi in lobby) Now the nastiness... *As I checked in, I handed the front desk 1 credit card, then another, and then a 3rd, being told that all my credit cards were declined (perhaps because I forgot to tell my credit card company that I was on vacation and leaving the US). I called my credit card company only to find out that for each time my card was run through their machine, it didn't cross over to their system. Basically, their machine or terminal was down. Instead of trying it on another machine, what frustrated me was that the front desk made it MY PROBLEM. How is it my problem when your stupid machine doesn't work??? The only other option the TRAINEE front desk girl gave me was to pay for the room in cash. Uhh...I didn't bring $600 dollars to pay for my room. Who in the world carries $500+ in their wallet just in case their credit card doesn't work??? Seeing my frustration, her supervisor came over and ""forced"" payment on my card which went through and worked like magic. Now, had it been the first time using this card in Canada, I could see a problem, but 5 hours earlier I had just checked out from the Sheraton only 2 hours away without any problem! Problem #2-Valet/Bell Hops I finally get a room and make my way outside to my awaiting husband. I go to this window to pick up a self-parking pass and get directions to the garage (1 block south). All the while, I am asked by valet if we'd like our bags taken up to our room. I figure, that's probably a good idea as we do not have to haul our bags down the street from self-parking all the way to our room. As I tell the valet yes, a bellhop shows up to take our luggage away. We are told that once we arrive and call down, they will bring our luggage up??? First I'm told it will be left in the room, next I'm told that after we park the car we need to call to have our luggage brought up to our room, in which it might take 20-30 min. So, I guess I'm wondering is...WHAT'S THE POINT??? I might as well just carry it up to my room myself. We ended up carrying our luggage to the room and then self-parking the car later. After all the fuss with the front desk and now valet, I just wanted to be away from them all and unpack and relax. So much for those Westin ads that beckon you to stay at their hotel for a RELAXING experience. It was one of the most troublesome and frustrating experiences ever, at least this location. I can not recall ever being so upset after a stay at any of the Westins I've frequented, this was definitely the worst. Not coming back.",negative
Dealing with this hotel is absurdly annoying - I am currently planning an event there for my organization and their sales/catering team is a nightmare. I've worked with Erinn Good (terrible with customer service and can't spell) and Karen Bannerman who is supposed to be her boss (even worse customer service and couldn't care less about the errors her staff makes) and I am completely regretting using the Westin. Overpriced with frustrating staff!,negative
"Clean rooms, well designed and great views, but there were several very annoying things going on during my particular visit. Including having only two elevators servicing the north tower during a massive wedding party. I had to wait for 40 minutes to get down to the lobby. Also, nothing is included in the already inflated price. I'm not sure why this is, but for some reason, the nicer hotels don't see it prudent to include internet service in their packages... This is a real bummer. The cost of getting the very slow internet for 3 days was 50 dollars. My entire month of high speed internet at my home is 30 dollars. My room was also next to the elevators, which given that it seems to be a pretty active place, ment that I had to listen to the engines kick in like a jumbo jet all night long. Also the guests getting off the elevator didn't seem to mind that I had to get up at 5am, but who can blame them... Overall, a comfortable stay, but I didn't have to pay for it, (business) and I probably wouldn't have if I had the choice.",negative
"Exquisite hotel, spacious deluxe rooms. The location and views are outstanding and the Toula Restaurant on the 38th floor is perfect for a nightcap. The Front Desk gave us a complimentary upgrade because it was my fianc√©e's birthday. Pricey, but its an official 4-Star all the way. Highly recommended.",positive
"Nice Hotel right next to the water. Nice View. Clean rooms. Nice walk to the park. The room we had had a large lcd screen. And a nice view of the harbor. Wife was there for a conference. I guess they are trying to be ""Green"" so there was no bottled water. We also had a banquet there for my Aunt. It was a nice size ballroom. About 15 tables and a dance floor. There was a deck outside with a view of the harbor.",positive
it's a hotel. It's right downtown close to everything. Can't ask for anything more. A great experience staying here. The beds were nice. The tv was good. I'm sure it has gotten better since the last time I stayed here. I would suggest staying here once.,positive
I liked the fact that I could choose my car from a section - therefore if u don't like a particular car or selection you don't have to waste your time to walk back in... so for example if a car is too low or too small u just go to the next spot and see if u like it..... I found a ford focus hybrid right away and liked it -the mileage was good not the best but it was fun to drive something I never drove before and got to pick and choose -most places don't let u do that these days airport taxes in Phoenix are very high - I mean very high.... my charge was about 250 but with airport taxes it was 40% more... it is one of the top 3 highest in the country so be prepared - the price quoted over the fone is half after u are done with airport taxes but this has nothing to do with them - it is just the location,positive

"I had a good experience with thrifty car rental (my first time). Scott at the ticket counter was a lot of help. I was happy with the service, price and a nice mid size car. I will use them again.",positive
"Booked with Thrifty through Expedia so that I could pay in Canadian dollars, so I didn't actually have to deal with Thrifty for the payment process. The car rentals at The Phoenix airport are actually a shuttle ride away. The shuttle is frequent, but takes about 15 minutes, so plan your time accordingly. Once I arrived at the Thrifty counter it was actually closed, so I had to go to Dollar, their sister company, to get the keys. This wouldn't have been a huge deal except that the line up at Dollar was long. They really could have had both kiosks open. I waited almost an hour to get the keys. They were out of midsize cars (which is what I had paid for) so I got upgraded to a full size for free. The pick up and returns process was simple and seamless, and the Expedia booking was super cheap. I paid $260 Canadian for a week-long rental. Not bad!",negative
Do NOT rent from this company!!! 20 people in line and ONE person working. Over an hour to pick up a car. My deposit went through a foreign country as well. Run to a different company as fast as you can!,negative
"Used Top Notch for our Mom/ Daughter group to go to the Taylor Swift concert at Cardinals stadium. This company is SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! Stay away... !! Should be ZERO stars!! -We booked two one-way rides on the 22 pax party bus, originally had 15 pp... ended up with 20. We were charged extra for that for some reason even though we still weren't at capacity. -Bus still wasn't large enough for 9 adults and 11 small girls. -The drive up was miserably hot and never cooled down. It was a hot day, but the ac in the bus never dipped below 86 degrees! We were dripping in sweat -All of our belongings were to be removed from the bus since it was two one ways but our driver told me she had no rides in between ours so not worry about taking our items off or cleaning up at that point, but we would for the return .. great way for her to scam us into paying a cleaning fee!! -Once the show was over, there was so much mis-communication about pick up. Our group met at the area where busses/limos/ubers are supposed to drop off and pick up. Rachel (driver) claimed she couldn't get over there because the roads were closed... not sure how all the other limos/ busses got over there. We ended up having to walk over a mile to get to our driver!! Not convenient at all, especially with 11 kids, 1 pregnant lady, and a lady in a foot cast. Part of the luxury of booking a ride like this is so that it is convenient for US. It was almost as if she had never dropped off or picked up from a concert/sporting event because they all have a drop off/ pick up zone. - Our driver was super irritated with us at pick up, even though we were the ones that just walked a mile, wouldn't take a suggestion on a freeway that would get us home sooner, literally yelled that she would get on the freeway when her app told her to, and slammed the privacy door closed. -After we got home (almost 3 hrs after the concert ended), everyone got off the bus and I sat and talked to Rachel for a minute. I told her I collected all the trash (a few bottles, snack bags), there was a few popcorn kernels on the ground and I asked her if I should grab my mini vac from my garage to clean that up because I wanted to leave the bus as it should be. She turned around and said ""You guys made ANOTHER mess?!"", ""Ugh, I'll just clean it up myself when I get back to the yard"". Again, I told her I would be happy to sweep or vacuum it up at 1:30 am in front of my house, but she refused. -Icing on the cake was that Rachel, our driver, literally peeled away from my house as fast as she could. Super unprofessional and looking back it was almost scary that all of us moms had her driving our children. -Of course I got charged a cleaning fee even though she wouldn't let us clean it ourselves, and when I called the next day to talk to the owner he was HORRIBLE. Completely screaming at me, could not even listen to any of my concerns, and then hung up on me!! Not sure how on Earth this company is still in business with this complete lack of customer service!!!!!",negative

"I've used TNT for sometime now. I especially like their service, reliability and their drivers. When I have any event, game or concert I need transportation for they are my number one call.

Avoid all the problems with uber and simply use these guys!",positive

"Adam and Eric saved the day today. They are literally superheroes as far as I'm concerned. I had an event scheduled a whole month in advance with another party bus, (you can see my review on yelp for that one too) The owner of that business texted me today, the day of my event, four hours before my event and canceled on me, stating ""the bus broke down last night"". I was in the grocery store getting last-minute party items at the time and I literally almost had a breakdown in the store. I quickly called three other companies. Two of those dispatchers (kindly) laughed at me because I was asking them if they had a 30 person party bus readily available, on the most dedicated Christmas party night in December, oh! and I need it for four hours and I need him here in two hours. Adam was unbelievably quick and responsive to my distress. He said he needed to call me back in one minute and let me know what he could do. He truly called me back in one minute and said he had a driver getting back from Prescott very soon, and that he could be at my house by 5:15, AND we could have the bus until 9:15pm, and he agreed to pick us up and drop us off exactly where I requested AND he even gave me a more competitive rate than what I had paid for a month in advance with the other company. My party was a huge success. We all had a wonderful time . The bus was beautiful. It had a huge FAUX fireplace, and all the fun swirling lights and fabulous sound system. Bring your own Pandora music collection and hook it up on their state of the art sound system. Everything was wonderful and everything went as smooth as a babies bottom. I highly recommend them. I could tell right away that Adam operated by a completely different business caliber, far beyond what other people that I had spoken to earlier today possessed. The bus was gorgeous, it had a huge faux burning fireplace on the back wall And it had space for coolers, beers, wine, soda and ice etc. Eric our driver, did everything that Adam said he would, In terms of picking us up, dropping us off, being on time, being professional and very courteous, and everything else that goes along with being a professional and responsible employee. Thank you so much for everything! I added a couple of photos to show you what a fabulous time we had.",positive
I recently took one of top notch's party bus Mercedes vehicles and wow! What an amazing experience. The attractive female driver was very courteous to me and my business partners visiting from California. They arrived early and waited outside for me and my friends to be ready. They also make great suggestions on where to visit in the Phoenix area. I will always use top-notch transportation for all my transportation needs in the future,positive
"Fantastic service, cars, drivers once again! I've used this company a few times and always impressed with everyone, Adam and Courtney are great and organize everything to perfection. Our driver Cydney was polite, courteous, and very personable! This company is truly Top Notch and I look forward to our next special occasion with them.",positive
"SMOOTH, PROFESSIONAL AND FUN!!! A quick and simple phone call where the owner of the company answered the phone, gave me options, rates and confirmed the details. After flying four hours, it was nice to not have to fuss with an UBER at an unfamiliar airport, especially with a 4 and 7 year old in tow. My flight landed 30 min. early the driver was already at the airport. I had asked for a specific beer and water for the kids. To our delight, the beer and water was on ice. We also needed a booster seat and that was included at no cost. I was also able to play music from my ipod to entertain the kids. This was the absolute best way to rejuvenate after a long plane ride. My wife was not crazy about paying for a limo just for an hour ride. After this experience, she insisted our next trip to Arizona will include Top Notch Transportation! THANK YOU ADAM!!!!!",positive
"We had our annual company meeting in Scottsdale Arizona this July. We stayed at a beautiful resort that offered transportation services from the company they were contracted with. Once I received the quote from them, I began to price other company's. I found Top Notch on the internet and sent them an email with a list of our needs for transportation while we were in town. Not only did they quote me a better price, they beat the other company by almost $3000. Being that we are on a budget, we obviously signed the contract with Top Notch. I couldn't have been more impressed. All of the vehicles were in pristine condition. The drivers were extremely friendly and made sure they stayed in contact with us the entire weekend. We had several flight delay's and they never once complained that we were messing with their schedule. I never had to worry that they wouldn't be there when we asked them to be. On a personal note, once the meeting was over, my husband and I needed a ride to a friends house for the afternoon. We rode with Adam. Although it wasn't on the original schedule, he made sure he had someone there to pick us up that evening and get us to the airport. We were going to use Uber, but he had a driver waiting for us. I would highly recommend this transportation company if you are in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.",positive
"Today is 6/10/2016 and I just received a message from Top Notch re: my review of 1/22/2013, Now this really disappoints me, if he wanted me to update it to 2 stars - well he gets that, but he didn't asked and just continued to reprimand my intelligence. He referenced Uber which did not exist in AZ in 2013 and NO his rates were not published inside or outside of the vehicles at that time (perhaps now they are 3 years later). and YES I was told by the skeevy shill it was a taxi service. YES Top Notch was a higher end SUV but the service was not classy when driver asked for cash then a 20% tip. I typically tip well and was insulted to be told to give a 20% tip which by the way is actually a little low for me. Seems that this company does not understand the concept that there are great reviews and sometimes not so great reviews.",negative
"On a recent trip to the Scottsdale area I reached out to Adam with virtually no notice to get over to a friends house for an evening cook out. Adam dropped what he was doing and picked up my family w/ about a 15 minute heads up. For the rest of the week we used Top Notch for most of our transportation that required someone else to drive for us. Every trip was in a new/newer, well maintained SUV vs. jumping in a taxi with the fam. Daniel did most of the driving for the rest of the week. He was very friendly and did a great job of getting us to our destination in a timely and safe manner. I very much appreciated the ability to send a text or make a quick call and get a quote with tip for any destination (15 minutes to 45 minutes away). I can't recommend this company enough and will definitely use them in the future when we have the chance to make it back to the Scottsdale area. Can't rave enough about them!!!",positive

"I called Top Notch at the last minute for a bachelor party. We needed a standard limo from 12:30pm - 2:30am. The reservation was so quick and easy I wasn't sure if someone would actually show up! The driver arrived around 12:20pm, called to tell me he had arrived, and waited outside the club until we all made it outside. The limo was your typical black stretch town car. The inside was lit up, looking fancy, adorned with various assorted beverages for us to consume. The driver knew the owner (or bouncer?) of the next club, so he came inside with us to comp our cover charges. Even though we were all drunk and not as happy upon departing that night, the driver was a consummate professional - apologizing for our bad time, but never letting it affect his treatment of us. He got us home safely and let me charge my credit card. The reason I give 5 stars is that I tried to make arrangements with two other limo services before Top Notch. The first one never called me back to confirm my pick-up time and location. The second was not only too expensive, but also rude and uncooperative. Top Notch took the order and delivered!",positive

Placed a last minute order online and they dropped off the two sets of Men's Ping clubs (one left handed and one right handed) right to the resort lobby they were at. He gave great advice on other courses to try out and some great local hot spots to check out while in town! The clubs were in great condition and they even offered different pick up locations and discounts on tee times. Top notch and with a sense of urgency. They will be my ""go to"" anytime I'm in need of club rentals!",positive
Outstanding customer service and top line rentals!!! Was in Phoenix for a week staying at a resort and got their Ping rentals for each of us. Clubs were in excellent condition and the free drop off and pick up service made it so I will never travel with my own clubs again. A weeks rental was close to the price of a one round rental at the courses for the same clubs. Great business!!!,positive
Travel Golf was great. Adam dropped off clubs at our rental house and picked them up. Clubs were decent and couldn't have been easier. Thank you for making our travel a bit easier.,positive
"Flew into Phoenix, went straight to the golf course. Clubs were there waiting for me with my name and tee time posted on them. Great set of clubs that were then retrieved for me after 108 holes of wonderful AZ golf. So easy!!!",positive
"I rented two sets of clubs from Travel Golf Center, and picked up at Golf Anything in N Scottsdale. The product and service provided by both was fantastic. Gary, from Travel Golf called me within 20 minutes from my flight landing, to let me know the clubs were ready. Paul from Golf Anything was extremely helpful with a great store. It is nice to see companies that deliver above expectations. I highly recommend both.",positive
"Let me start by saying yelp should offer an option for companies that deserve less than one star. US airways would certainly qualify for less than one star in customer service. I booked a flight on American, but discovered when attempting to check in that the flight was fulfilled through US Airways. Although I booked through American, I could not check in for the flight on the American airlines app. I also could not check in for the flight on the American Airlines website, or the U.S. Air website. When I called US Air for assistance they refused to check me in by phone. They insisted that I had to go to the USAir website and check in. Their offshore customer assistance representatives are extremely condescending to those needing assistance. Hint: if you find yourself in this situation, the record locator that American airlines gives you, is actually what US airways calls a confirmation number. You will not see the phrase record locator on the US airways website. Also, there is no button that says check in on the U.S. Air website. You only see a reference to checking in after you have worked through numerous screens regarding seat selection, etc. At that point, the site announces that you are checked in. The good news is that hopefully by the end of this year the name US Airways will no longer exist.",negative
"US Airways may be the worst airline right next to Spirit. I flew them to go to Burlington, VT for a wedding. On the return, our flight began announcing delays about 45 minutes before boarding. Fine, no problem. There were harsh storms back at home. We kept being told that there was a delay and the next announcment would be made in an hour. This happened 4 times. Once the lady got on and said ""no new update, next update in 20 minutes."" Finally, flight was cancelled after 4 hours. Everyone ran to the counter to rebook. They gave me a stand by flight. My friend ended up renting a car and driving 8.5 hours to be sure we would get out of there. They wouldn't even give us a free room. I've been told that US Airways' unofficial motto is ""I'm sorry,"" because this is what they always say and never fix anything. I will never fly them ever again. What a night mare to travel.",negative
"This airline was awesome. Just recently, I had gone out of town, from Lexington to D.C., and just arrived back today. Even as I still have a beef with many airlines not serving snacks for free, there are still other things that can make an airline experience better. Still, this is one of those things that I would not be angry about, if they brought this back (hint hint..U.S. airways). What I have to say though was that I was glad the staff of my flight today had stayed behind when my first leg (from D.C. to Charlotte) came in late. The pilot, of the first leg, had said that we had landed 22 minutes early, however, the first leg was actually LATE. Since this was the case, I almost did not make my second leg. While I was sprinting towards the gate, I found the airline still out there and personnel loading bags on. Now I do not know if this was by chance that they were still waiting for me or what; but with all the time that had elapsed between me, getting out of the first plane; picking up the hand carry, they checked in with the yellow tag; and then racing over to this gate, the plane seemed to just sit there. Some personnel from Charlotte, working under this airline, and in rhythm with the customer service rep of the airport, had found a way to let me on. Thank LORD!",positive
Wow is all I can say. We had to move one of our plane tickets because my girlfriend had to have emergency surgery. They wouldn't move the ticket and said they don't have a health clause. They said she should have bought insurance. This is by far the worst airline ever. What they don't realize is their main offices are in Tempe and we live in Scottsdale. I will be getting a refund in person. NEVER USE THIS AIRLINE.,negative
"The worst flight experience I've had. Lost luggage, they didn't know where it was and they sent us to two different terminals to attempt to find it. They didn't want to give us an estimated time frame for the baggage delivery, and they complained to US when we called to inquire that they didn't have time to schedule the bag to be dropped off because the phones kept ringing. We later found out that the bag didn't make it on our initial flight, and we were in three airports on two different airlines. We won't be flying with them again.",negative
"US Airways is, by far, the worst airline I have ever encountered. They do not allow transfers or refunds of tickets for flights that you have to cancel and do not allow the person who purchases the ticket to receive the credit if they bought it for commercial purposes. Their customer service is rude and inflexible, and they charge exorbitant fees for basic flight necessities.",negative
"I submitted a travel claim a couple of weeks ago that was refused by Allianz to provide coverage. The reason why the claim was submitted was the funeral home that handled the death of my father, changed the viewing date from July 1st to July 3rd. July 3rd was the original return flight. The wake ceremony after the viewing, was to follow. I am my dad's oldest offspring and needed to attend the wake. The funeral home did not tell me about the change until July 1st. So I had to rescheduled my return flight. US Airways charged me an extra $245.00 to make that change. I asked US Airways for a bereavement exemption. They indicated my Allianz traveler's insurance I purchased will cover that. Allianz rejected the claim. I could have saved about $70.00 by buying a return ticket from another airlines instead of paying $245.00 and expecting to be reimbursed (as the US Airways agent indicated to me). So I feel cheated and resentful. Also, my brother-in-law from Atlanta was in the same difficulty attending the latter viewing and received a bereavement exemption from added charges for changing his return flight from Delta Airlines. He did not even buy travel insurance. I brought travel insurance. . My dad's funeral cost me plenty (he had no life insurance) and the added costs of Allianz NOT honoring an obvious bereavement case, is a great financial burden to me. I'll never buy traveler's insurance and never fly US Airways or American Airlines who brought them.",negative
"I would give no stars if it was not for the first leg of my flights. I'm not going to go into details but let me give you a few adjectives: RUDE, BITTER, CARELESS.... I don't see how one business seemed to hire only employees who seem to hate life and seem to allow them to get away with it. Where is common respect for your customers US Airways? I sure hope you can take some learnings from American Airlines.",negative
"OMG the worst! My mom had a stroke and I needed to book the soonest flight. US Air had the soonest flight but it was first class. Fine. Except IT WAS THE WORST!! The plane was dilapidated, beat to heck I thought it was held together with bubble gum! I froze the whole way...teeth actually chattered! The flight attendant told me it was always cold close to the front because of the door!! What!!??? The friggen door doesn't seal all the way??????????????????? I paid extra for first class and first class is worse than coach? I hate getting ripped off! Get to my destination and my TRAVEL PRO suitcase handle wont extend. Try wheeling a big suitcase through the airport without a HANDLE! It is the most expensive, sturdy suitcases and they BROKE IT. They handled it so roughly they jammed the handle so hard it wont extend. Then they told me tough luck they don't cover handles or wheels on luggage! I will NEVER travel this airlines again for any reason!!",negative

"I just got off the phone with your customer relations rep and was told that we would not be getting any sort of compensation for the 6 hour flight that you turned into a 12 hour ordeal. In addition, I received a email stating ""In order to ensure that all carriers remain focused on safety, aviation regulations do not require airlines to pay compensation or reimburse expenses because of delayed or canceled flights. This would include such items as lost vacation time, missed meetings or other pre-paid activities that occur during a flight irregularity. I am very sorry we are unable to accommodate your request for compensation."" and ""The flight returned to Phoenix since it is a US Airways hub. We have mechanics on hand and as in this case, a substitute aircraft. These options are not available in Los Angeles."" Really? You mean that you are absolved from all compensation so that you can focus on safety? You mean that you couldn't fly another airplane to LAX, a hub that I know you fly out of? Your customer service rep seemed shocked that I would even mention this idea. Sorry but you lack of compassion for your passengers has cost you another customer. And I will be posting this to the FAA/DOT, Yelp and Google reviews in hope that some other poor traveler will be spared from dealing with you.",negative
"Short trips, your flight attendants suspend service to passengers with minimum turbulence yet it is safe enough to stand at the front of the plane and gossip about the differences of the 2 unions they work for, managers at the terminals, etc. Sad when employees cannot get along and it shows in their attitudes and performance. Probably trickles down to the passengers who are rude to one another. Too high priced in comparison to Southwest who has bigger seats, friendly employees, friendly passengers and amenities. You cannot tell me Southwest can charge cheaper rates and give more and better service for almost twice as less US AIR charges for all the attitude and lack of service. They are very slow on delivering bags to the terminals as well. I just road Southwest, and on both trips the baggage was there promptly! Hardly any wait on full planes. How does a cheaper airline pull of so much and US AIR cannot deliver? Sad.....I am now a big fan of SOUTHWEST. GOODBYE US AIRWAYS FOREVER!",negative
"They basically STOLE my ticket back from me! My husband and I were flying my folks out to Phoenix to babysit our kids for a few days. We bought them each a round trip ticket from LA to Phoenix. A day later we realized we needed them here a day earlier than planned, and of course understood there'd be a $150 change fee per ticket. So, I kept the ticket as it was and purchased a new, additional one-way ticket for just my mom so she could get here early and then my stepdad would fly out a day later on the original ticket. All was good until it was time to check them in for their return flight back to LA. My mom's original return flight wasn't coming up on the computer. I called US Airways and they said since she didn't travel on her original flight out, that she unknowingly forfeited her return flight as well. After utter shock and anger, they made me buy another last minute, full-priced ticket to get her home today. So to sum it up they received twice the money from us, and then received money from another passenger for using my mom's original seat. Does this sound unreasonable to anyone else? There's no reason they couldn't have just put her on that plane this morning without charging us yet again. I'm disgusted with this airline and will avoid them as well as American, for any future flights.",negative
"Made my honeymoon flight arrangements in January (seating together), then with their computer conversion the entire flight had to be changed (had to sit on the phone for an hour plus and made sure that we would be sitting together (again its our honeymoon)... but of course today (May) when I went to confirm was not the case. Worse customer service - their computer issue and they are unable to admit to the problem and correct it unless I want to pay $90+ dollars --- this is unacceptable - my reservation was correct and their computer issues/people made the error.",negative
"I purchased an upgrade to First Class with a connection. $150 later and ticketed for First, I was denied access to the lounge. Never had this problem with other airlines. Will never fly with US Airways again!",negative
"I got here via my United miles. Unfortunately US Air's services suck. The plane was unbearably crowded; the food inedible, the ""commercial"" broadcast over the PS were annoying; there was very poor video access (only a central screen) for a cross country flight. On the positive side, the flights left on time. I will avoid them in future if possible.",negative
"Do not fly U.S. Airways... We are in the process of sharing our story. We chose them because they claimed that they allowed carry on pets and they were less expensive than South West. While they sell it as animal friendly they were anything but... Well, it cost us humiliation and our trip because we never made it. I don't think that I will go on any airlines again. I think that airport security is out of control and needs checks and balances placed on them before I'll ever consider it. For more about our story check out our blog. I would never give U.S. Airways another chance because they were rude from the ticket counter all the way to the plane. Rude old flight attendants, over crowded, over sold seats, and nasty old plane. There was no Welcome or thank you for flying... Just ""Keep the line moving because You're delaying take off.""

"This review has been a long time in the coming: In 2003 I flew to London from Denver with three of my friends - NONE of our bags arrived with us. No big deal you say, because they'll 'be on the next flight' ----- but then they weren't, nor the next, nor the next. Several days later we decided to move on, so we went to Spain but kept checking with US Airways. Communication was always difficult and never fruitful. Long story short, we spent about a month on the continent and OUR BAGS NEVER SHOWED UP!!! They were eventually returned to us in Denver, in terrible shape, of course. I didn't fly with these guys for years after that but recently decided to give them another (their last) shot; my flight was rerouted, delayed about six hours and then I was forced to spend the night in another city (not my destination) because all connections had left. This was not during any sort of peak travel time. In short, another abysmal failure. ***Bottom line:*** US Airways' service is as awful as can be. I wouldn't fly them for free. Choose any other airline over these incompetent clowns.",negative
"Last month I did not have a good experience with US Airways. worst customer service on the phone. called several times to confirm the flight and don't know why they changed the flights for my parents in two different times / different airlines?? what?? At this point, I need to talk to an operator.. a human!! pls!! and how long is the wait????? the automatic response tells me that the wait is 149min.. ok.. I don't have that many minutes or over two hours to wait.... thanks for the warning. So I decided to try a different time. GEE, tried at least four times to talk to somebody and the shortest time was 49 min!!! after several tries, FINALLY I have a human person on the phone!!!! Operator: I am sorry, we don't handle this type of transaction, let me transfer you to the right department. I was transferred and the wait is ... 144 minutes!!!! ARGGGGGGG Dear parents: I love you so much and I want you to visit me very often because I really miss you. BUT pls do not flight US AIRWAYS!!!",negative
"US Airways is like two different airlines. If you're an elite member you get good US Airways, otherwise you get bad US Airways. I travel a lot for work....not exactly a badge of honor but, whatever...and I have to say that when you reach that level a whole new world of service opens up to you. One of the things they do that I like is the policy of automatic upgrades, based on availability. Other airlines want you to fiddle around with coupons and such. These guys just give you a seat. Simple and efficient...works for me :-) To me airlines are sort of like cell phone providers. They all suck, some just suck a little less than others. With the hub-and-spoke system the airlines have created more or less a monopoly. If you live in Phoenix the only viable options are US Air and Southwest. Sure, there are other airlines but you'll be faced with connections and poor schedules so pick your poison. ALL airlines experience delays and they ALL lie about the reason for the delay. When they say it's a 15 minute delay it really means an hour. They intentionally oversell flights in the hope that someone will cancel. Unlike the hotel elite programs, your miles WILL expire if you're not careful and don't expect to get a courtesy note either. Why the rant? It's only to illustrate that all airlines are the same. US Airways is no better or no worse than any of the others. I will say this for them though, their frequent flyer perks are fairly good and relatively easy to reach. Once you get to Gold or Platinum the upgrades are pretty regular. Just being able to use the first class check-in line at the airport is nice, even if you don't get a first class seat that day. So yeah, it's not perfect but it's better than some. And that's about as close and I'm going to get to a compliment for any airline :-)",negative
"Eff you United for pushing us on a plane ""Serviced by US Airways"" for one of the most miserable flying experiences of my life. Also, if you accept our reservation, at least check us in at your desk - rude lady at the counter in SJ almost got joy from telling us we had to get back on to the bus (with our 5 bags - which by the way they charged us $110 for there, and $195 for back) and head to sorry ass Terminal C. To make things worse, in Phoenix, the wait to check in was over an hour and a half. Got to the airport 2 hours and 15 minutes before our flight and because of US Airways total crap service we boarded our plane with only 10 minutes to spare. And while this not their fault - but because you've been stressed and miserable dealing with the idiots inside the airport - you are just destined for two bumpy ass flights while in the sky. Making a fart sound... Giving 1 star and now I'm an exclusive Southwest flier.",negative
"I don't personally know anyone who's had cosmetic surgery (and if they have, their surgeon did an excellent job at concealing it), and as such I've never seen botox, collagen, a facelift or a rhinoplasty up close. Until I flew with US Airways. One of the flight attendants had such a terrifying amount of plastic surgery that it was actually uncomfortable to look at her face. I don't know what US Airways' hiring practices are, but I was under the impression that flight attendants should be somewhat pleasant to look at...or at least, not so frightening that children might burst into tears upon making eye contact. The woman was actually Hispanic but you wouldn't know by looking at her - face frozen in time, lips so full and stiff her mouth barely moved when she spoke (I heard someone explaining the safety features of the aircraft and was kept looking around to see whose mouth the words were coming from), her eyes had that sort of ""crazy"" taut look, MJ nose and shiny, just-facelifeted complexion √† la Jocelyn Wildenstein (http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/26671/thumbs/s-JOCELYN-WILDENSTEIN-FACE-PHOTO-large.jpg) Snacks and non-alcoholic beverages were complimentary and plentiful, both of my flights departed AND arrived early, and the pilot popped on the loudspeaker every so often to announce the Super Bowl score for those of us who cared. What's not to like?",positive
"Well...these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline. US Airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way (meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price). Mostly on time. They could stand out from this averageness, however, if they would not make so many Nickeling and Diming efforts. For example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive. When checking in on line, all seats except the pre-assigned center seats (different rows, even though we bought tickets together) were $15. This, of course, to compel you to spend another $30 to sit with The Wife (yes, $30, since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the pre-assigned centers....psychology, anyone??). Then, we were almost late at the airport, but still went to the underused check-in counter. We asked if we could sit together. Result: Reclining exit row seats for free in a half-full plane. Then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a 1hr earlier plane, which was not full. However, the representative at the gate wanted $50 per ticked to make this change...again the Nickel and the Dime! Do they realize how bad this looks? Letting us on would not have cost anything, but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway, we went for coffee, saved the $100, and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed! More from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their ""force people to check bags to collect more revenue"" efforts. Sitting at the gate, the loudspeaker blasted something like: ""If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now, but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding, you will be charged for the bag when we check it in""-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then, when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the ""sizer"". It was slightly too thick, and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted, and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me! Bottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'! Fly Southwest if you can!",negative

"US Airways used to be right up there w/Continental.. now they're down there I didn't even mind the fact that they started charging for their food.. But now they're going overboard.. I didn't want to bring a heavy jacket w/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice. I noticed there weren't any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said "".......yea.. for $7"" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke. He wasn't. Introducing US Airways' ""nap pack"" comes w/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest, for only $7! Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities! So I decline.. and they must crank the A/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldn't sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w/my stretched out light jacket.

"Dear US Airways, For those of us who don't have the money to spoil ourselves on first class and economy, you really make us hate flying. As if wasn't annoying enough to go through check-in lines, security lines, take off your shoes, laptop, jacket, liquids and the typical crappy-expensive airport food, getting on your plane still makes it worst than everything else. Lets start with the fact that you cheap out on your customers. No food, no snacks, minimum drinks, disgruntle service. Lets add to that the fact that more than 4 times you have told me that the flight will be delayed (time unknown) because you had to ""check the engines"". Really? really? You need to CHECK THE ENGINE? is it to see that you won't kills us? It seems that you're the only airlines that has the need to do this, and to not let me know until WHEN you are delaying the flight but instead tell me that we should ""check back"" in 15-30mins. Lets continue with the fact that added to these delays, you delayed one of my flights almost 3 hours (in 30 min intervals, of course, so we never really knew until when the delay was) AND that once you told me that the engine had failed, you made me wait again until you got another plane, and then wait even more because you ""have the plane but not a gate for it"". Added to this is the fact that I spent the midnight of my 21st bday at the freaking houston airport and didn't get home until 5am on a monday when I had class at 9am insetad of arriving at the original time of 12am. I get that you are trying to be cheap to keep your prices low... but maybe you should reduce your costs by being more efficient instead of skimping out on your customer service.",negative

Don, the owner, picked us up in the shuttle an hour early from Vdara Hotel where we were staying, as the car was ready ahead of schedule so I was able to get even more time than I had reserved. I had reserved it about a month before the trip. It is truly a beast when you have 610 horses working together. It is a beautiful thing when you put it in sport mode and let it down shift itself for you! Cruising the strip and going to a different hotel every night for a show or club or dinner was magical. Having it valet parked as it always gets parked near the main entrance no matter what hotel we went to Wynn, the Cosmo, Mirage, PH, Hard Rock, all ways turned heads.

This the best kept secret in Vegas. They treat you like a King and explain the car in every detail unlike Hertz where they leave you to figure it out.

Already knowing what car I want the lady took down my info and boom it was done.They picked me up with a shuttle at my hotel and brought me to the garage. Quick and easy I got to see all the cars that were available and it was very comfortable. They offered me beverages and what not. Hassle free I would recommend renting a car from them every time I go to Vegas! Don't bother going anywhere else because you might be lied to.

Kept telling myself I'm going to rent a crazy car one day in Vegas and this time around I jumped on it and rented the black Ferrari 458 Italia. Very simple professional process to rent it that went quickly and free of hassles. Before heading on out on the road Leo gave me a run down on the car and explained a few things which was a good thing. The car was amazing fun to drive with the engine behind you and the performance blistering not to say turned heads everywhere I drove it! I would be returning it after hours at 8 pm and Don met me at the location to return it which was a step above as I bet most places would ask you to return it on time when they close!

The staff at Rides was so friendly and gave us a great recommendation on our day trip. If you are considering a once in a lifetime experience (but I will be back) these are the ones to go with. What an amazing line up of vehicles hopefully see you soon.,positive
"This place is awesome!! We live in Vegas and have done this. Best prices, best people, huge selection and no hassles! Just need drivers license and insurance with nine of the deposits and outlandish crap the other places want. All pretty much new and up to date super cars! Vegas is great to take the top down and go. Plenty of time with plenty of miles and fair, great people running the show. Just do it!!",positive
"Don and james team 110% 1st class. Soon as i walked in, don called me out by nsme welcomed me and broght me in his office offered bottle water and made the paperwork process as quick and efficient as possible. Very personable guy. Showed us the ins and outs of the car and let us go on our way. Probably in the office and out the door in 20 min tops. Upon arrival checked back and had a cab ready for us to get us to yhe airport in timely fashion. 110% recommend and will be a returning client!",positive
"Oh man where do I begin! This place is the best rental service in not only Vegas but I would have to say in the United States! The staff was so friendly, they made me feel at home and answered every question and worry that I had to make me feel good about the rental. I rented out a Ferrari 458 Italia for an afternoon and it was an amazing experience. Before leaving I was shown the car and was explained to just how each and every thing in the car functioned. I recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas. Not only are they very friendly they have some amazing prices, and no hidden fees, what you see is what you pay! I love this place and there is no doubt in my mind I WILL most certainly be coming back the next time I visit Las Vegas.I think you guys have found yourself a new loyal customer! Thank you so much for the amazing experience and looking forward to renting another one of your amazing vehicles!",positive
"I gotta say that this place is my paradise because it makes my dream of driving an exotic car on the street came true. I wish I can give more than 5 stars because their customer service is beyond excellent! First off, when I got there and walked in that door with excitement, the personnel there were very generous and friendly. While I was going over some paperwork with the lady staff there (sadly I was too nervously excited that I forgot her name), the detailer was offering waters to my family who were waiting at the lounge. When it's time to check out the car I was renting, she told me that the white Lambo Gallardo Spyder Performante I intended to rent was not available due to the key for it was broken and therefore giving me an orange color of the same model as an alternative instead. In fact, that orange one is actually a later model than the white one (2013 vs 2012) but no major differences. Since I am a huge Lambo fan, I absolutely had no problem with that at all. Frankly, I picked the white one because I thought it's brighter in color and would be more attractive and sportier based on the picture I saw online, but boy I believe that I was wrong when I looked at the 2 cars in person. The orange one was actually more eye catching and attractive. And it was in a like new condition too! So I was glad that I ended up getting that one instead. In addition, they offered me an option to keep it for 16 hours instead of 6 hours due to the fact that I wasn't able to get the car I wanted in the first place. Now that's what I called loyal customer service right there. They surely know how to accommodate you well to make you an happily satisfied customer when something went out of track. I would totally take that option if I didn't have to wake up early for the convention I had to go to the next day. So the lady staff did a walk thru of the car with me, and everything was piece of cake. When I was in the car listening to her instruction, I was so nervous to a point that my leg was shaking because I know that I'm about to pilot an $240k car on the street, which is something I've never done before in my whole life and I would be in deep sh*t if anything goes wrong because I am using my own insurance lol! When I was cruising on the strip, I noticed many drivers and pedestrians were looking at me, with no doubt. Some people in their car even gave me thumbs up and heart signs, and people walking on the strip took pictures of me. Before I was one of them whenever an exotic car passed by, now I got to be the celebrity lol! Now here comes the fun part. I was the first one at the light. When it turned green, I gave it a lil bit more gas than I normally do, and that 570HP V10 machine behind me was echoing madly thru the strip, leaving the other cars behind me in the dust. I bet that would make you feel like a million bucks when you get attention with that engine screaming madly and powerfully. The most exciting part was 2 guys in an older model Corvette and a cab were asking to race me. I told them just a lil bit. So all 3 of us were the first one at the light. When it turned green, I gave it a lil bit more gas like I did before, and man, I was 100 ft ahead of them already before they even started to take off! Even tho it was exciting, I still managed to keep it at the speed limit because I don't want a ticket ruining my awesome experience! When it was time to return the bad boy, James was there to greet us. He was so friendly and generous that he offered me and my friend some drinks because he knew that powerful engine in the back would make us sweat like crazy, not to mention it was 100+ degrees outside too. Thank you VLR for giving me an opportunity to experience this awesome adventure and would definitely come back again!!!",positive
"Total 5 star experience. Last trip to vegas I rented from someone else and it was very shady and upsell crazy. This time with Vegas Luxury Rides, I booked the Yellow Lambo on their website. Showed up about 40 minutes early but was told no problem. Took my ID and card to make copies, signed a few docs, next thing I know I'm in the Lambo getting a controls walk through. No upselling, no mystery surprise charges, nothing. Simple simple simple. Car overall in great condition. I did have the older 2008 lambo so some upholstery had wear but that is to be expected. Owner actually mentioned that one was being traded in for a 2014 soon. Oil light did come on during drive, called concierge and he said if I came by they'd top it off and give me some extra miles for the trouble. Took 5 minutes! Return was just as easy. Again, no surprise charges or upselling. Totally amazing experience in an amazing car.",positive
"Absolutely top notch. I've rented three times from Don and James, and they always show the same unmatched level of enthusiasm and customer care. The prices are the best you will find, and you can take the cars anywhere. There is a great Red Rock Canyon ""scenic drive"" that is exactly 50 miles round trip from the rental location, so fits perfectly within the 4-hour rental mileage limit. Highly recommend Vegas Luxury Rides if you are looking for a splurge at a decent price. I'll also reiterate another review that stated that there are no hidden fees - you pay exactly the prepaid amount, unless you go over your miles or don't bring it back with a full tank.",positive
"Fan-freaking-tastic Rented the black Ferrari F430 Spyder and drove it around Red Rocks until we got sunburn. Has all the kick it promises. Before we showed up, I was admittedly worried this would be some kind of shifty deal, sneaky add-on charges, and all that. But no worries - it was simple, priced as promised, and all worked out great. Don was exceptionally nice; he clearly loves the cars too and seems basically psyched that others are coming there to enjoy them. Most of all, rocketing down the road in a convertible Ferrari is just totally awesome. The looks and pictures were amusing -- but the pure speed was the deal.",positive
"I wanted to drive the Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder LP570-4 Performante before leasing one. I began by looking into my options. Option #1. Drive a Lambo at the Las Vegas speedway, while it would be an adrenalin rush, it would not give me the road feel of the car. Option #2. Drive the car in a multiple car caravan option could be interesting, but I have heard that they radio your car if you are aggressive in any way. It sounds more like a mule ride down the Grand Canyon. Option #3. I could not believe my good fortune when I found Vegas luxury Rides, they had a 2012 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder LP570-4 Performante for just $799 for six hours. Six hours on the open road with 570HP with no supervision, other than the police ""of which I saw many"" was unbelievable. In Los Angeles you would pay $1300 plus for the same privilege. I could not believe they would let me drive off with their $280,000 car for just $799 on my credit card*&%%$#^^^(*+ The owner was amazing with the minimal instruction required, the off we went. There were two things that I put above all other, do not get in an accident, and do not get a ticket or watch as the car got towed away. I chose to drive out on the N.15 towards the Valley of Fire national park. We drove the park, of which the curvy roads were amazing. The state portion of the park was mostly posted at 35 mph. Hard to get any speed at that rate. Driving back to Vegas on the Lake Las Vegas portion of the park is Federal land, and the speed limit increased to 55 mph. So 70 and 80 was not out of the question, and for me, 115 was my top speed on a nice straight away. Would I have loved to test 130 or more, sure, but I didn't want to get arrested and have the car towed away, oh well. I got to test the 0 to 80 acceleration many many many times, and got to feel the power of the V10 at my back, what a rush. In the end I could not see owning this car, while it is a monster, it is to loud on a regular basis, very very hard to get in and out of for my age, and a bit skaty in the front end. I drove my Porsche turbo on a 5 week cross country trip and could never see doing the same in this car. Oh well, back to the drawing board. Maybe the 2013 Tesla S, 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds and corners like a Ferrari ""because of the battery placement"", while carrying 5 adults.......",positive
"Went to Vegas for my Dad's 60th Birthday. His entire life he has talked about driving a Ferrari but never had the chance. Found Vegas Luxury Rides online and it was an excellent price. My brother and I got there early to make sure all of the paperwork was complete and Don in the Office was such a huge help, he was super friendly and knowledgeable. My Dad showed up a few minutes later and was so excited to see the car. The Ferrari F430 Spyder was in excellent shape and my Dad had the best time of his life with the car, he is still talking about it non stop and telling all of his friends. When we returned with the car we met James one of the owners. He was very friendly and welcoming, I can't wait to go back in November it will be my turn to rent the Ferrari!! Thanks guys for making my Dad's Birthday the most memorable ever!!!",positive
"AMAZING (everything) The wife rented me the red F430 for my 30th birthday (I however did the shopping around). Vegas Luxury Rides is in my opinion is the absolute best place to rent an exotic vehicle. I checked around for prices and they were the best (no hidden fees). The other places I checked had some serious flaws/issues, ie the place on the strip that rents a yellow Lamborghini, the damn car looked like it had been stolen. Scratches all over the body and wheels and it was even missing the drivers side door handle cover! I also checked out a company that does exotic vehicle ""tours"", which lets you take turns driving 6 different vehicles. However, I decided a ""tour"" was not for me after reading their fine print. Basically their rules were: no speeding, no reving the engine, no quick accelerations and no photography (so you pretty much have to drive their vehicles as if it were grandpa's Cadi). VLR's rules were simple and straight foward: dont redline, dont go offroad, and if you get a ticket you're responsable for it. Basically treat the car as if it were yours. Onto the Ferrari, one word, AMAZING. Customer service at VLR is top notch. They advise you to come in 15-20 min early to go over the car (so you dont cut into your rental time). They were very friendly and professional. When you rent the F430 I suggest a trip to Mt. Charleston (in the summer only though). Its Vegas' ski resort but in the summer time its a long whindy road with little to no traffic and I didn't see one cop :-)",positive
"AMAZING day! My husband has always wanted to rent a Lamborghini and on this trip we decided just to finally do it. Sadly the Lamborghini was having engine troubles the day of our rental so they gave us a Ferrari instead along with some extra miles for free & a sincere apology. I think it was fate because we LOVED the Ferrari. Before we left Don helped us map out our entire route to make sure we could do everything we wanted in the time we had. We went to the Hoover Dam, took a beautiful Lakeshore scenic drive, then went to Red Rock Canyon. As soon as we parked the car at each location & started to walk away people walked up to it and took pictures in front of it. More people took pictures of our car than the Hoover Dam! We felt like rockstars :-) Everyone at Exotic Luxury Rentals is very, very nice. They made sure we had bottled water & sunscreen on because it was a hot day. They showed us how to operate the car & said to call if we had ANY questions or if we got lost. They even called us a taxi when we get back so we could get back to the hotel. I did expect to find some hidden fee's when we picked up the car, but the rate on their website is the final rate you pay. If you've ever wanted to drive a luxury car, this is the place to rent from. I have a feeling we'll be back!",positive
"WOW!! 5 stars for the excellent customer service Don and James gave they were just so cool. I mean the look on everyone's face when Don pulled up with the Ferrari for delivery was priceless. He was very wonderful and kept very well communication until he arrived. Not to mention he was punctual. The only hiccup was that I reserved a Lamborghini in January and was not able to receive notice until a couple of days before the rental time in March. An email was sent a day before with another car in place and when I didn't respond they called to make sure I was aware. I was a little disappointed its not THE dream car, BUT the thrill of the experience driving a Ferrari through the canyon roads looking at everyone else looking at you makes up for most of it. The prices are very reasonable the service is excellent. Thank you so much Don and James you guys were the best you gave us the experience of a lifetime. I'll be back for that Lamborghini!!",positive
"You want a five star experience? See the guys at Vegas Luxury Rides. Top notch service all around. The cars are extraordinary, and the service is great. I highly recommend! They will treat you right with no hidden fees or taxes! Best deal in Las Vegas!",positive
"I contacted three luxury car rentals in Las Vegas before contacting Vegas Luxury Rides. I went online and did my research. I needed a red convertible sports car at a specific date and time. Vegas Luxury Rides by far was the most professional, customer-oriented, affordable and informed luxury rental car company in Las Vegas. There is no company in the city that can top their level of service and quality of luxury rental cars that they provide. James and Don were extremely polite, professional and informed. They explained their inventory of cars, the criteria to rent their cars, pricing, etc. They were accommodating to my requests and needs. If they could not meet it, they were up front and honest but provided me with a different solution. I was a very happy customer prior to receiving the Ferrari F430 Spider. When they delivered the car, I was ECSTATIC!! The car was absolutely BEAUTIFUL and in AWESOME condition. Their pricing is affordable in comparison to the other companies in the city and their is no hidden charge!! Their quality of cars and customer service is unbeatable!! You get more than what you pay for and you won't be disappointed.",positive
This is a Class operation. The choice of cars is Wow! The personal attention you get From James & Don is remarkable. Car was in excellent condition. Don showed every important (& even less important attribute- where the cup holders were hidden) on his drop off. Live your dream- rent with this company with complete confidence on your next visit to Vegas.,positive
"My experience at Williams Passport Photography was excellent. From the beginning to the end. Nabil is very professional and very knowledgeable. He made me feel very comfortable and the process was very fast. At the end, he show me the exact dimensions of the photos. I was very pleased with the result. I will use this services again in the future.",positive
"After reading stellar reviews, made the long trek out here. Made a same-day appointment for 4:45pm. Arrived at 4:47pm. When I arrived i was told to ""take a seat"" and given a bottle of water. Waited for 50 minutes while Nabil finished printing another client's photos. It would have been nice to know there would be a wait. Nabil later apologized. Nabil is a professional artist and made sure he got a good shot. They also charge a small fee for using a credit or debit card.",positive
I went for my passport pictures today and the photographer was very polite and professional. I had gone to Walgreens before for pictures and they were horrible. I decided to try this one and what a difference... he has good eye and good equipment. He gave me water as soon as I sat down so that was nice since my drive there was kind of long. Great photos!,positive
"Searched Yelp looking to get passport photos. Notices that every review here was for 5 stars. While it out of the way coming all the way from Goodyear I must say it was well worth the trip. I had sent a message earlier in the day and within minutes Nabil responded. He offered me several time slots. When I got there I was greeted by his wife who was very pleasant. Nabil took several photos and I was made to feel very comfortable. The total time from when I walked in until I left was less than 20 min and the photos were perfect. As others have said no need to go anywhere else, this is the place to go. I would highly recommend him.",positive
"Nabil was great helping us with a New Zealand visa application. He was very patient and flexible with the long list of requirements New Zealand immigration had for the photo. When we ended up having a technical issue when filling out the application, we called him up and he was able to take care of it for us without us needing to go back and retake the photo. Nabil clearly understands customer service and goes the extra mile. His fees are very reasonable for the quality of service provided and the flexibility of times he offers. Highly recommended!",positive
"Called on short notice. Nabil got us right in, was detailed oriented and in less than 30 minutes we had our passport photos. Business is in his home, but has studio and waiting area right in the front. Thank you Nabil!!!!",positive
The photographer was excellent. He took his time to explain what he needed to do and the price was acceptable. Don't go to Walgreen's or AAA. This guy is a PROFESSIONAL!,positive
"I needed a photo to renew my US passport and have had negative experiences trying to get them from Walgreens so I found this photographer on Yelp. I texted with my desired appointment time and got a response right away. The service was quick, painless and very professional. Would highly recommend.",positive
"I got a response right away when I called. I was worried, because I'd never had a passport photo taken before, and I tend to somehow make weird facial expressions, but everything went perfectly. Nabil is very professional, courteous and accommodating. He took a few shots, and let me see them, and took several more until I was happy with the result. He even offered bottled water when I first came in, and though I was nervous about having my photo taken, everything was very comfortable and easy. Afterwards, he gave me two copies of the photo cut to size, and showed me all the measurements with a ruler showing how the photo is in compliance with the regulations and specifications in every way. I asked if he thought I might need a digital copy, but he was honest and let me know that it would cost more but would most likely be unnecessary, though he keeps the photo on file if I might ever need it. It took less than 30 minutes, and I could tell he took much care in finalizing the photo. It was perfectly done, excellent quality, no shadows, and I would definitely come here again and highly recommend to others!",positive
"Nabil went above and beyond for me. I initially went to him to get pictures taken for a Malaysian Visa. I asked him to take pictures with a blue background. He was Very professional and quickly I was in my way with what I thought were the right size pictures! I received news that these were wrong. Hesitant on returning to him, I called him anyways. Nabil, with no hesitation asked me to return, reprinted the pictures to the correct size and even gave me a couple more because of the correction. Great guy, and super polite and professional!",positive
"I texted for appointment and got a response right away, I was there, in and out in less than 15 minutes! It was well worth my 18 mile drive, knowing that the pictures are taken with the end result in mind, helps me scratch one more thing from my list. Very nice and professional gentleman, will refer others!",positive
I used Williams passport photos to get a Canadian passport. I highly recommend this business to anyone in the need of a passport. Great detail was given to the requirements of the passport photos I needed.,positive
"This is a wonderful, professional and personal service. A level of service, frankly, one rarely finds anymore. Highly recommend.",positive
"I highly recommend Williams Passport Photos. I didn't want to trust CVS or some other place with my pictures, which in those places is usually taken by someone not experienced. Also, being a hobbyist photographer I wanted to support a local photographer with my business. I'm glad I found Williams on Yelp. Scheduling my session was a breeze, which I did online. Upon my arrival I was met by Nabil, was offered some water and waited in a comfortable room while he set up. The session went well and I could tell Nabil takes great pride in his work. Job well done. Thanks!",positive
Walgreens no longer cuts U.K passport photos! This place is on a quiet street in a private home. Very professional and great quality. If you need a none US passport photo or a better quality passport photo this is the place to go. Highly recommend Williams passport photography to everyone.,positive
"I cannot begin to thank Nabil for his quick help. I needed a U.K. Visa photo within ten minutes and he was very responsive and supportive, in addition to being detail-oriented in that short span. Thanks to him, my supporting documents can be emailed to the U.K. visa people in time. Thanks, again, for your help and the bottle of water while I was running out in a hurry!",positive
Great customer service. And they can print your photo to any specification. I used them for green card photos and will definitely use them in the future for passport and visa pictures.,positive
"Needed a professional photo with specific requirements and measurements. I tried both Walgreens and FedEx but they were too sloppy with their photo services (shadows, blurry, discolored, disproportionate). Decided to make an appointment at Williams Photography and Mr Williams provided swift and friendly service (15 min). He did a meticulous job with the post production and the photos turned out great.",positive
My wife and I were there to get photos for our UK and Schengen (German) visa. We recieved very professional service and were in and out in about 30 minutes with our pictures. It was nice to have pictures that worked for both UK and the German visa (as both countries have different requirements). They are well aware of the rules for visa photographs for different countries. We had no problems receving a visa with the pictures provided from both the consulates. Providing bottled water while we wait is also a nice touch. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends!,positive
"Very nice, very professional- took 20-30 minutes- located in their home- nice neighborhood, clean. Bring cash- takes his time to make it right. Highly recommend. Thank You Mr. & Mrs. William!",positive
"First time here, they have Europe pasport photo's size. It was very cozy setting place and they have a friendly service;). I highly recommended this place!",positive
I found Williams Passport Photos on Yelp and was able to make an appointment the next day. Mr. Williams was very kind and knowledgable about the photos I needed. Overall it took less than 20 minutes and the pictures came out great. For $22 I feel like I got a fair deal and am very satisfied with my photos.,positive
"The best I've ever dealt with regarding passport photos. He made sure that the photos were flawless and met the UK guidelines needed in order to be accepted, even measuring them in front of me to make sure. The location is a private residence in south Phoenix, but don't let that throw you off. He has a proper office and photography studio and all of the necessary means to take Visa/MasterCard and PayPal payments. The prices were a bit more than CVS or Walgreens, but the photos will be perfect and the size will be perfect as well. And you'll likely get more photos for the money. I got 6. It took about 30 mins from beginning to end and I look forward to using Williams' services in the future for some family photos. I would come back anytime I need passport photos or any photography needs.",positive
"Mr. Williams knows what he's doing. After trying triple A and Walgreens and dealing with a bunch of people who couldn't find the UK on a map I was delighted to find Williams Passport Photos. I had photos that he demonstrated to me met all of the United Kingdom passport requirements within 20 minutes of arriving. He said none of his UK photos had ever been disallowed, but I still waited for my passport before writing a review. Glad I found this place. Definitely worth the price and drive out to his home.",positive
"At first I was a little worried I was in the wrong place because this business is run out of a home, so I wound up at a home address. But when I realized I was at the right place and entered, Mr. William was very professional, nice and did good quality work. He took the photos and I had them printed and in my hands in less than fifteen minutes. He went over all the Canadian government specs for passport photos and showed me that my photos (the ones he just took) met all these requirments. The price wasn't too bad ($33) and I was able to pay with my credit card which was really convenient. I have not heard from the governmenr about my passport application but I am sure these photos will be accepted. I would definitely go there again or recommend any other Canadians looking for good service and quality!",positive
"Called and he was easy to schedule with and did a great job on a Canadian passport photo. He knew the size and was very informed on the regulations. Great job, reasonable price and easy to deal with.",positive
"My husband and I and my son had taken passport photos in Williams and they are all successful in one time. We are Canadians. Canada is quite strict with the photos. My son first took the photos in a lab in Scottsdale. Eventhough I have took the specification to the store, and they claimed they are professional at passport photos. But they spent very little time on my son, and finally the photos had been turned down by Canada passport office because the background is not white. later I found williams in google and found the website is quite professional. My husband hesitate that it is home business. But I want to try. I am very happy with my decision. Williams is nice, professional, and he carefully measure the photos to make sure it is qualified. Also he gave us the e-receipt for us to show the office we did take photos there. We stayed at his cozy home and wait for a while and the photos are ready. comparing my son's first failure photos, we stayed at that noisy store, waited for a long time to take the shot even we have made an appointment. several months later, my husband and I need to renew the passport, and of course, we went to williams again. and later we got the passport without any problem. So give home business a try, you will have very comfortable and successful experience.",positive
"This is already my 5th using the service of Williams Passport Photos. Mr. Williams is very professional and patience to accommodate my time and need for my British passport, US VISA renewal, and green card application. Whether I need digital copy or hard copy, he can make the pictures with the exact measurement and brightness. Even I was confused about the requirement, he would solve the problems based on his experience. Overall, all my pictures from this studio are never rejected, so I would highly recommend this place.",positive
"Excellent place for out country passport photo's, they know all the requirements and do an excellent job. Everything is done while you wait, very quick,highly reccommend this shop.",positive
"GO HERE FIRST FOR PASSPORT PHOTOS. I had passport pictures for an Irish passport taken on 9/12/2011. This is the fourth time and place I have had them taken. The Irish are very fussy. Mr. Williams and his wife have their professional studio in their home. Mr. Williams was very careful about taking and processing the photos. He asked if I needed color or B/W. I said they preferred B/W, but would take color. He gave me both. When he showed me the finished photos, he measured them in front of me with his metric ruler, so that I know they are the correct size. I recommend Wiliams to anyone. In fact I encourage you to go to them first, because you will have pictures done correctly. The Williams are very cordial and professional.",positive
